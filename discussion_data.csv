"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to all sexually active adolescents and to adults who are at increased risk for acquiring or transmitting STIs.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
All sexually active adolescents are at increased risk for STIs and should be counseled. Other risk groups that have been included in counseling studies include adults with current STIs or other infections within the past year, adults who have multiple sex partners, and adults who do not consistently use condoms.Clinicians should be aware of populations with a particularly high prevalence of STIs. African Americans have the highest STI prevalence of any racial/ethnic group, and STI prevalence is higher in American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Latinos than in white persons. Increased STI prevalence rates are also found in men who have sex with men (MSM), persons with low incomes living in urban settings, current or former inmates, military recruits, persons who exchange sex for money or drugs, persons with mental illness or a disability, current or former intravenous drug users, persons with a history of sexual abuse, and patients at public STI clinics.
<h3>Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>
Behavioral counseling interventions can reduce a person's likelihood of acquiring an STI. Interventions ranging in intensity from 30 minutes to 2 or more hours of contact time are beneficial. Evidence of benefit increases with intervention intensity. High-intensity counseling interventions (defined in the review as contact time of &ge;2 hours) were the most effective, moderate-intensity interventions (defined as 30 to 120 minutes) were less consistently beneficial, and low-intensity interventions (defined as &lt;30 minutes) were the least effective. Interventions can be delivered by primary care clinicians or through referral to trained behavioral counselors.Most successful approaches provided basic information about STIs and STI transmission; assessed the person's risk for transmission; and provided training in pertinent skills, such as condom use, communication about safe sex, problem solving, and goal setting. Many successful interventions used a targeted approach to the age, sex, and ethnicity of the participants and also aimed to increase motivation or commitment to safe sex practices. Intervention methods included face-to-face counseling, videos, written materials, and telephone support. The USPSTF did not find enough evidence to determine whether the following intervention characteristics were related independently to effectiveness: degree of cultural tailoring, group versus individual format, condom negotiation or other communication as an intervention component, counselor characteristics, setting, or type of control group.
<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>
The CDC provides information about STI prevention, testing, and resources at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/default.htm"" target=""_blank"">www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/default.htm</a>. It recommends that health care providers inform patients on how to reduce their risk for STI transmission, including abstinence, correct and consistent condom use, and limiting the number of sex partners. The CDC also maintains an inventory of efficacious interventions in the &ldquo;Compendium of Evidence-Based HIV Behavioral Interventions&rdquo; (available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/prevention/research/compendium"" target=""_blank"">www.cdc.gov/hiv/prevention/research/compendium</a>). The Community Preventive Services Task Force has issued several recommendations on the prevention of HIV/AIDS, other STIs, and teen pregnancy. The Community Guide discusses interventions that have been effective in school settings and for MSM (available at <a href=""http://www.thecommunityguide.org/hiv/index.html"" target=""_blank"">www.thecommunityguide.org/hiv/index.html</a>). The CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has issued recommendations on the control of vaccine-preventable diseases, including hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/index.html"" target=""_blank"">www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/index.html</a>). The National Coalition of Sexually Transmitted Disease Directors and the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors developed optimal care checklists for health providers of MSM (available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.ncsddc.org/publications/optimal-care-checklists-providers-msm-patients"" target=""_blank"">www.ncsddc.org/publications/optimal-care-checklists-providers-msm-patients</a>).
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The USPSTF has issued several recommendations related to screening for STIs, including screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea, hepatitis B, genital herpes, HIV, and syphilis. These recommendations can be found at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>.<br /><br />
<h3>Implementation</h3>
Intensive behavioral counseling may be delivered in primary care settings or other sectors of the health care system. This may require referral from the primary care clinician or system. In addition, risk-reduction counseling may be offered by community organizations, schools, and health departments or their affiliated STI clinics. Despite the seriousness and prevalence of STIs, primary care clinicians often do not provide counseling about sexual activity, contraception, or STIs during routine periodic health examinations or other health care visits, and many believe that counseling is ineffective. Surveys examining STI counseling by primary care clinicians have found wide variations in practice. Stronger linkages between the primary care setting and the community may greatly improve the delivery of this service. Providers should select behavioral counseling interventions on the basis of their effectiveness, appropriateness to the patient population, and feasibility of implementation. Examples of effective behavioral counseling interventions are described in the&nbsp;Table. &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Table.

<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Most of the studies identified by the USPSTF were in high-risk populations of adults or sexually active girls. Research on interventions that reduce risk for STIs in sexually active boys, prevent STIs in younger adolescents who are not yet sexually active, and reduce risk for STIs in older adults are needed. More data are needed from trials including both sexes and other broad-based interventions that could be implemented in or linked to primary care. The effectiveness of low-intensity interventions that are more practical in the typical primary care setting is another research gap. Promising approaches have been identified that need replication.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling1#Pod5,151,"The CDC recommends that all providers routinely obtain a sexual history from their patients and encourage risk reduction using various strategies (for example, prevention counseling)&nbsp;. It also recommends that HIV prevention counseling be offered and encouraged in all health care facilities that serve patients who are at high risk (for example, STI clinics) and persons living with HIV. <br /><br />The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends discussing contraception and STIs during the initial reproductive health visit for adolescent patients. It also recognizes that the annual well-woman visit provides an excellent opportunity to counsel patients about maintaining a healthy lifestyle and minimizing health risks. The visit should include screening, evaluation and counseling, and immunizations based on the patient's age and risk factors. In addition, applying principles of motivational interviewing (for example, prompting patients to use safe sex practices and more consistent contraception) to daily patient practices has proved effective in eliciting behavior change that contributes to positive health outcomes and improved patient-clinician communication. Comprehensive care, including prevention of STIs, is recommended for lesbian and bisexual patients; education about the risks for STIs and dispelling the perception that STI transmission between women is negligible will help these patients make informed decisions. All patients should be encouraged to use safe sex practices to reduce the risk for transmitting or acquiring STIs and HIV, such as using condoms on sex toys, gloves, and dental dams and avoiding sharing other sex paraphernalia&nbsp;. Several approaches (for example, gender-tailored and culturally appropriate interventions to reduce risk-taking behavior) can reduce the rate of HIV infection and optimize health in women of color&nbsp;. Practitioners should provide risk-reduction counseling to prevent STIs in women participating in noncoital activities (for example, mutual masturbation or anal sex). <br /><br />The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement states that counseling on sexual behaviors to prevent STIs could be recommended beginning at age 12 years&nbsp;and for higher-risk adults. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends one-on-one structured discussions with patients who are identified as high risk for STIs (if the health professional is trained in sexual health) or arranging these discussions with a trained practitioner. When appropriate, practitioners should provide one-on-one sexual advice about STI prevention and information on testing to persons younger than 18 years, including pregnant women and mothers. The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends intensive behavioral counseling for all sexually active adolescents and for adults who are at increased risk for STIs.","According to the CDC, approximately 20 million new cases of STIs occur each year in the United States, and half of these cases occur in persons aged 15 to 24 years 8. A 2009 nationally representative survey found that STI prevalence (not including HIV) was 24.1% among female adolescents aged 14 to 19 years and 37.7% in those who were sexually active 9. In 2010, the inflation-adjusted annual direct medical costs of STIs (including HIV) were an estimated $16.9 billion in the United States 10. According to the CDC, STI incidence rates are consistently 8 or more times higher in African Americans than white persons 11, and African American youth accounted for 57% of all new HIV infections among persons aged 13 to 24 years in 2009 12.

	Scope of Review

	To update its 2008 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review1, 13 of the benefits and harms of behavioral counseling for sexual risk reduction in primary care to prevent STIs in adolescents and adults. The review included randomized, controlled trials and nonrandomized, controlled clinical trials of interventions targeting risky sexual behaviors to prevent STIs (alone or in combination with other behaviors) in adults and adolescents (including pregnant women) of any sexual orientation or level of reported sexual activity.

	The review included studies that were conducted in, or recruited participants from, primary care settings, mental health clinics, reproductive health clinics (including STI clinics), or broader health care systems in developed countries. Included studies reported health outcomes (STI incidence or related illness), behavioral outcomes (changes in sexual behavior), or adverse effects of sexual risk-reduction counseling (for example, care avoidance, shame, guilt, or stigma). Included studies had to have at least 3 months of postbaseline follow-up for all outcomes except harms. High-, moderate-, and low-intensity interventions were defined as having contact time of more than 2 hours, 30 minutes up to 2 hours, and less than 30 minutes, respectively.

	Effectiveness of Counseling to Change Outcomes and Behavior

	In adolescents, 7 trials2, 3, 14–18 with 8 treatment groups (n = 3407) reported STI outcomes. Incidence of STIs decreased in all 8 comparisons, although results were not statistically significant in 2 trials. Pooled results showed a 62% reduction in the odds of acquiring an STI after 12 months with high-intensity counseling (odds ratio [OR], 0.38 [95% CI, 0.24 to 0.60]; I2 = 65%; k = 5) and a 43% reduction with the 2 moderate-intensity interventions (OR, 0.57 [CI, 0.37 to 0.86; I2 = 0%]). In all trials, most participants were not white, and most trials were limited to female participants.

	In adolescents, 6 trials2, 14, 16, 18–20 (n = 3030) reported sexual behavioral outcomes. Interventions yielded benefit in 3 of 5 trials reporting effects on condom use or unprotected sex and 4 of 5 trials reporting other sexual behavior outcomes (for example, number of sex partners or use of birth control).

	In adults, 19 trials3–5, 15, 18, 21–34 (n = 61,909) reported STI outcomes, 4 of which had multiple treatment groups with varying intervention intensity. High-intensity interventions resulted in a 30% reduction in the odds of acquiring an STI (OR, 0.70 [CI, 0.56 to 0.87]; I2 = 23%; k = 9). The pooled effects from trials of low- and moderate-intensity interventions did not show a reduction in the odds of acquiring an STI. However, 2 low- and 2 moderate-intensity interventions proved effective in preventing STIs4, 24. For example, 1 large (n = 40,82), good-quality randomized, controlled trial 24 created a 23-minute video, ""Safe in the City,"" that participants watched in the waiting rooms of STI clinics. The video covered basic information on HIV and STI risk and prevention and attempted to build condom use skills along with self-efficacy and positive attitudes for condom use. Vignettes of young couples of various races, ethnicities, and sexual orientations demonstrated communication about partner notification and the acquisition, negotiation, and use of condoms. This trial found a small but statistically significant reduction in the proportion of participants with an STI. After an average of almost 15 months, 4.9% of intervention participants had an STI compared with 5.7% of control group participants (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.91 [CI, 0.84 to 0.99]; unadjusted OR, 0.85 [CI, 0.73 to 0.99]), which represents a number needed to treat of 123 (CI, 68 to 1859). Planned subgroup analyses revealed that the effect was statistically significant for men (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.88 [CI, 0.80 to 0.98]) but not for women (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.02 [CI, 0.86 to 1.21]).

	In adults, 21 trials reporting sexual behavioral outcomes yielded mixed results, but high-intensity interventions were fairly consistent in reporting beneficial results. In a meta-analysis of 9 trials (with 11 comparisons) 3, 21, 23, 28, 29, 34–37 reporting condom use or related outcomes, the odds of condom use increased by 29% with high-intensity interventions (OR, 1.29 [CI, 1.13 to 1.48]; I2 = 0%; k = 4) and by 21% with moderate-intensity interventions (OR, 1.21 [CI, 1.00 to 1.46]; I2 = 28%; k = 4).

	The USPSTF evaluated variations in treatment effect for different population characteristics. Trials and subgroup analyses targeting adolescents were highly likely to be effective, with most showing at least a 50% decrease in the odds of acquiring an STI after behavioral counseling. The USPSTF found no consistent evidence of differential effectiveness by sex or race/ethnicity. The USPSTF also found no evidence of differential effectiveness associated with low-income setting; mental illness; or history of sexual, physical, or intimate partner abuse. However, these groups were poorly represented in available studies. Some subpopulations were also poorly represented, such as low-risk populations, adolescent boys, MSM, and American Indians or Alaska Natives. Aside from the underrepresentation of important subpopulations, other limitations of the evidence review include reliance on self-reported behavioral outcomes and exclusion of comparative effectiveness studies.

	The USPSTF also evaluated the effects of different intervention characteristics. Intensity was the most important factor; high-intensity interventions were most likely to be effective, moderate-intensity interventions were less consistently beneficial, and low-intensity interventions were least likely to be effective. Pooled effect estimates were similar for trials with a single session and those with more than 1 session. The USPSTF found no clear relationship between the effect size and degree of cultural tailoring, group versus individual format, condom negotiation or other communication as an intervention component, counselor characteristics, setting, or type of control group based on qualitative synthesis. The USPSTF could not isolate the importance of these features because they were not evenly distributed across the spectrum of intervention intensity or population risk.

	Although most trials of low-intensity interventions did not show treatment benefit, 2 such trials effectively demonstrated a reduced odds of acquiring an STI: 1 very large trial of a video-based intervention that was powered to detect a small effect24 and the low-intensity group of a trial of African American women (4). In the latter trial, the intervention included a 20-minute individualized and culturally sensitive counseling session with trained African American nurse educators. Incidence of STIs was lower in both of the skill-based intervention groups at 12 months (14% [high-intensity] and 15% [low-intensity]) than in the control group (27%). The 2 skill-based intervention groups were not statistically different from the 2 information-based intervention groups (19% [high-intensity] and 22% [low-intensity]). Two3, 4 of the 4 trials that included high-intensity treatment counseling groups with low- or moderate-intensity groups were successful in reducing STI incidence in both groups and seemed to use the same interventionists for both treatment groups.

	Potential Harms of Counseling

	Two fair-quality studies22, 32 and 1 good-quality trial27 explicitly reported no adverse effects (n = 6,837). No studies reported an overall paradoxical effect on the incidence of STIs. However, 1 study of risk-reduction counseling with rapid HIV testing showed a paradoxical, statistically significant increase in the incidence of STIs in MSM (18.7% in men who received behavioral counseling vs. 12.5% in men who received only HIV test results; adjusted risk ratio, 1.41 [98.3% CI, 1.05 to 1.90])27. The USPSTF found no consistent evidence that interventions increased sexual activity in adolescents.

	Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit

	The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that intensive behavioral counseling interventions reduce the likelihood of STIs in sexually active adolescents and in adults who are at increased risk, resulting in a moderate net benefit.

	Response to Public Comments

	A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 29 April to 26 May 2014. In response to public comments, the USPSTF clarified that the recommendation applies to all sexually active adolescents and to adults who are at increased risk for STIs. The USPSTF further clarified that persons diagnosed with an STI should be considered at increased risk for subsequent STIs. The revised recommendation provides more information about treatment factors other than intensity and expanded discussion of the limitations of the available evidence. In addition, the USPSTF offered more guidance for providers on implementation of this recommendation. The USPSTF also noted the need for more information from trials in both sexes and other broad-based interventions that could be implemented in or linked to primary care, as well as interventions to reduce risk for STIs in older Americans.","<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that approximately 20 million new cases of STIs occur each year in the United States. Half of these cases occur in persons aged 15 to 24 years. Sexually transmitted infections are frequently asymptomatic, which leads persons to unknowingly transmit STIs to others. Serious sequelae of STIs include pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and cancer. Untreated STIs present during pregnancy or birth may cause harms to the infant, including perinatal infection, death, and serious physical and mental disabilities.</p>
<h3>Recognition of Behavior</h3>
<p>Primary care clinicians can identify adolescents and adults who are at increased risk for STIs. See the Clinical Considerations for more information.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that intensive behavioral counseling interventions reduce the likelihood of STIs in sexually active adolescents and in adults who are at increased risk. The USPSTF determined that this benefit is of moderate magnitude. The USPSTF also found adequate evidence that intensive interventions reduce risky sexual behaviors and increase the likelihood of condom use and other protective sexual practices.</p>
<h3>Harms of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of behavioral interventions to reduce the likelihood of STIs are small at most. The primary harm is the opportunity cost associated with intensive behavioral counseling interventions.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>

"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
About 5% of women and 3% of men in the United States have subclinical hypothyroidism.&nbsp;Of note, several studies have shown that about 37% of persons with subclinical hypothyroidism spontaneously revert to a euthyroid state without intervention after several years.&nbsp;About 2% to 5% of persons with subclinical hypothyroidism develop &ldquo;overt&rdquo; thyroid dysfunction.<br /><br />One retrospective cohort study found that levothyroxine use in persons with subclinical hypothyroidism was associated with lower risk for ischemic heart disease events and overall mortality;&nbsp;however, the USPSTF did not identify any clinical trials that evaluated the causal relationship between treatment and subsequent cardiac events. The USPSTF did not identify any trials or observational studies that evaluated the effects of treatment of &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism (with or without symptoms) versus no treatment. <br /><br />Subclinical hyperthyroidism is present in about 0.7% of the U.S. population and is more common in women than men.&nbsp;One quarter of persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism revert to a euthyroid state without medical intervention over time.&nbsp;An estimated 1% to 2% of persons with TSH levels less than 0.1 mIU/L develop &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hyperthyroidism (with or without symptoms). Persons with TSH levels between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L are unlikely to progress to &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hyperthyroidism. <br /><br />The USPSTF did not identify any studies that evaluated the benefits of treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism on final health outcomes, such as fractures, cancer, or cardiovascular morbidity or mortality. Except for 1 small (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 67) nonrandomized study that examined bone mineral density, no evidence was found on the effects of treatment of &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hyperthyroidism (with or without symptoms).
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
The harms of treatment of thyroid dysfunction have not been well-studied. The most important potential harms are false-positive results, labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment. <br /><br />False-positive results occur because TSH secretion is highly variable and sensitive to several common factors, such as acute illness or certain medications. Ascertainment of true- versus false-positive results is further complicated by a lack of consensus on what constitutes a normal reference interval. <br /><br />Consensus is also lacking on the appropriate point for clinical intervention, particularly for hypothyroidism. No clinical trial data support a treatment threshold to improve clinical outcomes. On the basis of expert opinion, a TSH level greater than 10.0 mIU/L is generally considered the threshold for initiation of treatment (in part because of the higher likelihood of progression to &ldquo;overt&rdquo;&mdash;even if still asymptomatic&mdash;thyroid dysfunction). The decision of whether and when to begin therapy in patients with TSH levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L is more controversial.A large magnitude of overdiagnosis and overtreatment is a likely consequence of screening for thyroid dysfunction, particularly because the disorder is defined by silent biochemical parameters rather than a set of reliable and consistent clinical symptoms. The high variability of TSH secretion levels and the frequency of reversion to normal thyroid function without treatment underscore the importance of not relying on a single abnormal laboratory value as a basis for diagnosis or the decision to start therapy. <br /><br />Currently, it is not possible to differentiate persons who will have advancing thyroid dysfunction of clinical importance from those whose TSH levels will remain biochemically stable or even normalize. Treating the latter group (at a minimum) will not lead to benefit, and these persons may experience harms associated with antithyroid medications, ablation therapy, and long-term thyroid hormone therapy.<br /><br />
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
Although exact estimates are not available for the United States, screening for thyroid dysfunction by primary care providers seems to be a common practice.&nbsp; In the United Kingdom, an estimated 18% to 25% of the adult population receives thyroid function testing each year.<br /><br />The annual number of dispensed prescriptions of levothyroxine sodium in the United States increased by 42% over a 5-year period, from 50 million in 2006 to 71 million in 2010.&nbsp;In 2013, there were more than 23 million new prescriptions and refills for a single name brand of thyroid hormone in the United States, making it the most commonly prescribed drug in the country.<br /><br />In 1996, a cross-sectional study of a U.S. population found that 39% of participants with TSH levels between 5.1 and 10.0 mIU/L received treatment.&nbsp;More recent evidence suggests that the median TSH level at initiation of thyroid hormone therapy has decreased over time; a retrospective cohort study in the United Kingdom found that the median TSH level at the time of first levothyroxine prescription decreased from 8.7 to 7.9 mIU/L between 2001 and 2009.<br /><br />Initiation and use of thyroid hormone therapy seem to be particularly common in older adults. Data from the CHS (Cardiovascular Health Study), a U.S. cohort of nearly 6000 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older, showed a steady increase in the overall percentage of older adults receiving thyroid hormone therapy (from 9% in 1989 to 20% in 2006) and a nonlinear probability of initiating levothyroxine therapy based on age; persons aged 85 years or older were more than twice as likely as those aged 65 to 69 years to begin thyroid hormone therapy (hazard ratio [HR], 2.34 [95% CI, 1.43 to 3.85]), independent of race or sex.<br /><br />Data on the proportion of asymptomatic persons with thyroid dysfunction who receive thyroid hormone therapy are lacking. However, given the high number of prescriptions for levothyroxine dispensed in the United States and the low prevalence of &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism among persons in the general population (0.3% and 0.5%, respectively,&nbsp;only a small fraction of whom are symptomatic), it is reasonable to conclude that many asymptomatic persons receive treatment. Clinicians seem to be treating more persons with thyroid dysfunction, at earlier times after initial diagnosis, and at TSH levels closer to normal.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
The most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States is chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis. Risk factors for an elevated TSH level include female sex, advancing age, white race, type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome, family history of thyroid disease, goiter, previous hyperthyroidism (possibly due in part to ablation therapy leading to iatrogenic thyroid dysfunction), and external-beam radiation in the head and neck area.<br /><br />Common causes of hyperthyroidism include Graves disease, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and functional thyroid nodules. Risk factors for a low TSH level include female sex; advancing age; black race; low iodine intake; personal or family history of thyroid disease; and ingestion of iodine-containing drugs, such as amiodarone.<br /><br />The USPSTF found no direct evidence that treatment of thyroid dysfunction based on risk level alters final health outcomes.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
The serum TSH test is the primary screening test for thyroid dysfunction. Multiple tests should be done over a 3- to 6-month interval to confirm or rule out abnormal findings. Follow-up testing of serum T4 levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 levels) and &ldquo;overt&rdquo; (abnormal T4 levels) thyroid dysfunction.
<h3>Screening Interval</h3>
The optimal screening interval for thyroid dysfunction (if one exists) is unknown.
<h3>Interventions</h3>
The principal treatment for hypothyroidism is oral T4 monotherapy (levothyroxine sodium). Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medications (such as methimazole) or nonreversible thyroid ablation therapy (for example, radioactive iodine or surgery). Although definitive data are lacking, treatment is generally recommended for patients with a TSH level that is undetectable or less than 0.1 mIU/L, particularly those with overt Graves disease or nodular thyroid disease. Treatment is typically not recommended for patients with TSH levels between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or when thyroiditis is the cause.<br /><br />
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Although detection and treatment of abnormal TSH levels (with or without abnormal T4 levels) in asymptomatic persons is common practice, evidence that this clinical approach improves important health outcomes is lacking. Long-term randomized, blinded, and controlled trials of screening for thyroid dysfunction would provide the most direct evidence on any potential benefits of this widespread practice. Serum TSH levels that define eligibility for enrollment, particularly based on age-specific ranges, are needed. Important clinical outcomes include cardiovascular- and cancer-related morbidity and mortality, as well as falls, fractures, functional status, and quality of life. Intermediate biochemical outcomes are less important; they are not reliable evidence of treatment effectiveness, and the effects of treatment of thyroid dysfunction on important clinical outcomes may be independent of any known intermediate outcomes. <br /><br />Before conducting screening trials, it may be more feasible for researchers to conduct well-designed treatment trials of either subclinical or asymptomatic &ldquo;overt&rdquo; thyroid dysfunction versus watchful waiting (including intervention if overt dysfunction becomes symptomatic), using final health outcomes, such as cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality, as the end points of interest. For such trials to be most informative, they should have clearly defined patient populations; intervention protocols (for example, treatment doses and target TSH levels); and study outcomes, including short- and long-term benefits and harms. <br /><br />Long-term observational studies are needed to better understand the natural history of untreated, asymptomatic thyroid dysfunction based on different serum TSH and T4 levels, as well as outcomes in persons with common but nonspecific symptoms. Useful information might be available from ongoing studies that collect biochemical samples; detailed demographic data; and information on functional status, quality of life, and other final health outcomes. <br /><br />Currently, the evidence does not show important benefits of treatment of subclinical thyroid dysfunction on blood pressure, BMI, lipid levels, cognitive function, or quality of life. Although treatment is associated with harms, it could have important long-term benefits on final health outcomes (such as reduced bone fractures and cardiovascular- and cancer-related morbidity and mortality) that may be independent of known intermediate outcomes. For example, evidence indicates that if treatment is effective for fractures or cardiovascular disease prevention, it is due to factors other than improvements in bone mineral density or lipid levels.&nbsp;The need for randomized trials that evaluate the effect of treatment of subclinical thyroid dysfunction on cardiac outcomes has been emphasized.&nbsp;Given the increasingly popular clinical practice of routine identification and treatment of asymptomatic persons with thyroid dysfunction and the treatment of those with vague and nonspecific symptoms, these trials are warranted. <br /><br />Studies that evaluate the harms of screening for and treatment of thyroid dysfunction are critically lacking. The USPSTF believes that false-positive results, labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment are important harms of any screening and prevention program and that these harms should be minimized. Additional evidence is needed on how to best communicate the clinical complexity surrounding screening for and treatment of asymptomatic thyroid dysfunction so that patients and their providers can make informed decisions. <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-dysfunction-screening#Pod5,150,"The American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommend considering screening for hypothyroidism in patients older than 60 years, as well as &ldquo;aggressive case finding&rdquo; (but not universal screening) in persons who are at increased risk for hypothyroidism and in women who are planning pregnancy.&nbsp;In 2006, 3 British professional associations (the Association for Clinical Biochemistry, the British Thyroid Association, and the British Thyroid Foundation) jointly recommended against routine screening for thyroid dysfunction in a healthy adult population, although the panel favors aggressive case finding in women with nonspecific symptoms.&nbsp;The American Academy of Family Physicians has endorsed the USPSTF recommendation.","Burden of Condition
Disorders of the thyroid gland are among the most common endocrine conditions evaluated and treated by clinicians. According to data from NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey), about 46 per 1000 persons in the United States have subclinical hypothyroidism, 7 per 1000 have subclinical hyperthyroidism, 3 per 1000 have “overt” hypothyroidism, and 5 per 1000 have “overt” hyperthyroidism.4
Currently, the most common argument in favor of early treatment of thyroid dysfunction is the possible associations among untreated subclinical hypothyroidism, risk factors for heart disease, and subsequent coronary disease or heart failure. However, the epidemiological evidence for this argument is mixed, and the available studies (including several meta-analyses) had important methodological limitations, precluding certainty in their findings.3, 23-28 If early treatment is effective in preventing coronary disease or heart failure, the current evidence suggests that it is probably through mechanisms other than mediation of blood pressure and lipid levels.
Recently, 2 prospective studies—Health ABC (Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study)29 and CHS30—showed a correlation between subclinical hypothyroidism and congestive heart failure, particularly in persons with a serum TSH level greater than 10.0 mIU/L (HRs, 3.26 [CI, 1.37 to 7.77] and 1.88 [CI, 1.05 to 3.34], respectively). This possible association warrants further study; however, it is not known whether thyroid replacement therapy would modify this potential risk.3
Scope of Review
The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to update its 2004 recommendation on screening for thyroid disease. The review assessed the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for subclinical and “overt” thyroid dysfunction without clinically obvious symptoms, as well as the effects of treatment of screen-detected subclinical and “overt” thyroid dysfunction on intermediate and final health outcomes. The review also evaluated the proportion of patients screened for thyroid dysfunction who have clinically apparent disease, the proportion with TSH levels of 10 mIU/L or less who are treated in current practice, and the cardiovascular consequences of untreated subclinical thyroid dysfunction.
Accuracy of Screening Tests
When used to confirm clinically suspected thyroid disease in patients referred to an endocrinologist, the serum TSH test has a sensitivity of about 98% and a specificity of about 92%.31 However, its accuracy is more challenging to ascertain when it is used to screen asymptomatic persons for thyroid dysfunction, for several reasons. First, there is no consensus on the appropriate TSH cutoff for a diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Most laboratories define an abnormal TSH test result by using the upper and lower limits of the 95% reference interval for a particular assay (generally about 0.4 to 4.5 mIU/L).3 However, laboratories use varying types of assays.32 More important, this threshold is arbitrary; it is not based on the risk for an adverse health outcome but simply a normal population distribution of values.
Second, TSH secretion varies among different subpopulations, such as those defined by race/ethnicity, sex, and age. For example, 12% of persons aged 80 years or older with no evidence of thyroid disease have been found to have TSH levels greater than 4.5 mIU/L.33 Therefore the “standard” population reference interval for older adults is probably inappropriate.10, 34, 35
Third, TSH secretion is highly sensitive to factors other than thyroid disorders. For example, serum TSH is frequently suppressed during phases of acute illness.3 Levels of TSH may also be affected by the administration of drugs or substances, such as iodine, dopamine, glucocorticoids, octreotide, or bexarotene.1, 15 Adrenal insufficiency, pregnancy (particularly during the first trimester), anorexia nervosa, certain autoimmune diseases, and pituitary adenomas can also interfere with normal circulating levels of TSH.3, 15
Fourth, serum TSH levels can vary by as much as 50% of mean values on a day-to-day basis, with up to 40% variation of values obtained from serial TSH measurements performed at the same time of day.36, 37
All of this confirms the importance of not relying on a single TSH value to establish a diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction. Serial TSH measurements are an essential step in establishing that a thyroid disorder is real and persistent.
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment
Early Detection
No studies directly evaluated the effects of screening for thyroid dysfunction on morbidity (including quality of life and functional status) or mortality in the general population.1, 2
Treatment of Hypothyroidism
Three trials (n = 239) found no statistically significant effect of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism on blood pressure1, 2 through 10.5 months of follow-up. Similarly, 6 trials (n = 385) found no statistically significant effect of treatment on BMI or weight1, 2 through 1 year of follow-up.
Evidence on the effect of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism on lipid levels is mixed. Several trials suggested potential beneficial effects, but the results are inconsistent and of uncertain clinical importance. In 8 good- or fair-quality trials (n = 597), 3 of which reported statistically significant results, differences between the treatment and control groups ranged from −0.7 to 0 mmol/L (−28 to 0 mg/dL) for mean total cholesterol level and from −0.6 to 0.1 mmol/L (−22 to 2 mg/dL) for mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level.1, 2 No studies reported statistically significant differences in levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides.1, 2 Whether changes in these intermediate outcomes due to treatment are adequate surrogates for cardiovascular morbidity or mortality is not known, and no trials directly evaluated the effects of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism on final health outcomes, such as cardiac morbidity or mortality.
A single fair-quality retrospective cohort study by Razvi and colleagues examined the association between treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism and risk for cardiac events.13 The study identified 4735 persons aged 40 years or older with subclinical hypothyroidism (based on a single TSH value of 5.01 to 10.0 mIU/L) from the U.K. General Practice Research Database. Mean follow-up was 7.6 years, and participants were categorized a priori into 2 age groups (40 to 70 years or >70 years). After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, socioeconomic status, blood pressure, total cholesterol level, smoking status, history of diabetes mellitus, levothyroxine use, and index serum TSH level, levothyroxine use in the younger age group was associated with lower risk for fatal or nonfatal ischemic heart disease events (4.2% vs. 6.6%; HR, 0.61 [CI, 0.39 to 0.95]), death due to circulatory diseases (1.4% vs. 2.4%; HR, 0.54 [CI, 0.37 to 0.92]), and all-cause mortality (1.2% vs. 2.2%; HR, 0.59 [CI, 0.21 to 0.88]). There were no statistically significant associations between treatment and cardiovascular outcomes in the older age group.
One limitation of this study is that it did not adjust for the use of medications that reduce risk for cardiovascular disease, such as aspirin or lipid-lowering therapy. Residual confounding for these and other variables could be present, although baseline data did not show differences between the treatment groups.13 Although the results are promising and justify the prioritization of further research in this area, this study is ultimately hypothesis-generating rather than proof of effect.
This study also reported an association between use of levothyroxine and reduced risk for any cancer death in persons aged 40 to 70 years (1.2% vs. 2.2%; HR, 0.59 [CI, 0.21 to 0.88]).13 The authors noted that this was an unexpected finding that should therefore be interpreted with caution, particularly because it was not the primary study outcome. This finding further underscores the probable presence of residual confounding and emphasizes the need for experimental research to ascertain the true effect of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism on cardiovascular outcomes.
In 2004, the USPSTF identified 5 trials that evaluated the effects of treatment on quality of life in persons with subclinical hypothyroidism. Only 1 trial, in patients with recent Graves disease, found a positive effect of treatment.38 Since then, 4 good- or fair-quality trials (n = 327) have been published, and none found a difference between persons receiving treatment and those receiving placebo through 1 year of follow-up.1, 2
Since the previous USPSTF review, 1 good-quality (n = 94) and 1 fair-quality (n = 69) trial have each found no effect of treatment of screen-detected subclinical hypothyroidism on various measures of cognitive function (such as cognitive skills and performance, cognitive status, speed of cognitive processing, and psychomotor tests of executive function) after 1 year.39, 40
No studies evaluated the effects of treatment of “overt” hypothyroidism (with or without symptoms) versus no treatment on any outcome.1
Treatment of Hyperthyroidism
No fair- or good-quality studies evaluated the benefits of treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism.1, 2 Two small (n = 14 and 20) poor-quality trials found no differences between treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism and no treatment on blood pressure, BMI, bone mineral density, or lipid levels.1, 2
The only identified evidence relevant to “overt” hyperthyroidism was 1 small (n = 67) nonrandomized study that evaluated the effects of treatment on bone mineral density.41 This study did not meet inclusion criteria and was not formally assessed as part of the systematic evidence review.
No trials evaluated the effects of treatment of hyperthyroidism (subclinical or “overt”) versus no treatment on final health outcomes.
Potential Harms of Early Detection and Treatment
Screening
No studies directly examined the harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction. However, screening clearly has potential harms, the most important of which are false-positive results, psychological effects of disease labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment.
False-positive results on serum TSH tests are common due to several factors. Secretion of TSH is sensitive to multiple factors unrelated to thyroid conditions; varies across time intervals, sometimes as short as a day; and varies depending on the population being considered (average TSH values may differ by age, sex, and race/ethnicity). In addition, there is no universally agreed-on “normal” TSH reference value, in part because it is not linked to the risk for actual adverse health outcomes.
Reliable estimates of the frequency of false-positive results from serum TSH tests are not available. A prospective observational study followed a cohort of 599 older adults after a single baseline TSH test, with repeated testing of 376 participants at the end of the study. It found that 37% (11 of 30) of participants with an initially elevated TSH level and 29% (5 of 17) with an initially low TSH level reverted to normal thyroid function after 3 years without intervention. Limitations of this study include the small number of affected participants, high loss to follow-up, and inability to distinguish between false-positive results and overdiagnosis with the methodological approach.10
Labeling someone with a diagnosis of disease may have adverse psychological consequences, particularly in the case of an otherwise asymptomatic condition. Although the patient may have previously felt healthy, being informed that he or she has a disorder that requires medical surveillance or intervention can result in anxiety or changes to the patient’s sense of well-being. A cross-sectional study of almost 34,000 persons aged 40 to 70 years found that women with known hypothyroidism were less likely to report good self-rated health compared with those without thyroid dysfunction (adjusted odds ratio, 0.49 [CI, 0.41 to 0.59]).42
Overdiagnosis of thyroid dysfunction is probably common, in part because the condition is defined biochemically rather than clinically and because disagreements persist about the appropriate cut points for classification of disease. The exact proportion of thyroid dysfunction diagnoses that are overdiagnoses is not known. However, many persons labeled with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism spontaneously revert to a euthyroid state over time; others never progress to noticeable health problems, especially those who are asymptomatic and have “mildly elevated” (4.5 to 10.0 mIU/L) TSH levels.
In 1 prospective study, 102 women aged 60 years or older with subclinical hyperthyroidism (defined as a TSH level of 0.1 to 0.4 mIU/L, as measured at baseline and 12 weeks after study entry) but normal T3 and T4 levels were followed for a mean of 41 months without intervention. At the end of the study, 24 women (24%) had TSH levels that had spontaneously normalized.14 A second prospective study evaluated the natural history of subclinical hypothyroidism. The study followed 107 persons aged 55 years or older with newly diagnosed subclinical hypothyroidism (defined as a TSH level >5.0 mIU/L on 2 serial measurements before study entry) for a mean of 32 months without intervention. After this time, 40 participants (37%) had reverted to a euthyroid state. Of note, nearly half of the persons in this population had been referred to the study clinic by their general practitioner because of the incidental discovery of an elevated TSH level during routine “analytical lab checking.” Forty-four percent also reported 1 or more symptoms commonly associated with hypothyroidism.11
Overdiagnosis is of concern because it leads to the psychological consequences of labeling and unnecessary treatment. It is a fundamental harm that should be avoided in disease prevention and health promotion.
Treatment
As with screening, limited evidence is available to assess the harms of treatment of thyroid dysfunction.
Levothyroxine therapy is a synthetic preparation of a natural hormone found in the body. Treatment of hypothyroidism with levothyroxine generally lasts for many years. Despite its previous widespread use in the United States, levothyroxine sodium was not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration until 2000. However, its approval process did not include studies that evaluated short- or long-term adverse effects. The product label cites possible adverse effects on bone mineral density and the cardiovascular system, such as angina, arrhythmia, and increased cardiac wall thickness.3
The previous review found that one quarter of patients who received levothyroxine were inadvertently maintained on doses high enough to make TSH levels undetectable. Although the ultimate effect of long-term overdosing with levothyroxine is unknown, it could increase risk for osteoporosis, fractures, abnormal cardiac output, or ventricular hypertrophy.31
Five trials published since the previous review assessed the harms of treatment of hypothyroidism with levothyroxine and generally reported no indication of harms or no or minimal (n = 0 to 2) withdrawals from treatment due to adverse effects. However, harms were poorly assessed and reported, and the studies were not designed or powered to evaluate long-term or serious harms or harms related to overtreatment.1, 2
In the case of asymptomatic hyperthyroidism, overtreatment may be of even greater concern given that one treatment option is ablation of the thyroid gland followed by thyroid replacement therapy. Patients who are overdiagnosed and overtreated could develop iatrogenic hypothyroidism and become dependent on lifelong thyroid hormone therapy. Overtreatment is also of concern because it can introduce opportunity costs; clinicians and patients may spend time focused on certain areas of health at the expense of other conditions or care needs that are of higher priority for the patient’s overall well-being.
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF found no direct evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults and therefore considered the indirect evidence on screening accuracy, benefits of early treatment, and harms. There is adequate evidence that the serum TSH test can identify abnormal levels of the hormone; however, substantial debate surrounds what constitutes an abnormal TSH level. Thresholds vary for different populations, such as older adults. Although a single fair-quality observational study found a possible association between treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism with levothyroxine and reduced risk for cardiac events, there is no evidence from randomized trials to prove that early treatment of thyroid dysfunction leads to clinically important benefits. The harms of screening for and treatment of thyroid dysfunction have been poorly studied. However, screening and treatment have real potential harms, and these harms are probably common. Overall, the USPSTF was unable to estimate the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 28 October to 24 November 2014. In response to the comments received, the USPSTF clarified some of the terminology used in this statement (for example, “reference interval” instead of “reference range” and “Hashimoto thyroiditis” instead of “Hashitoxicosis”) and added a reference for initiation and use of thyroid hormone therapy in older adults. The USPSTF also clarified that the systematic evidence review searched for studies on the treatment of thyroid dysfunction that used placebo or no treatment as the comparator.
Some comments noted that it would be unacceptable for clinicians to allow patients with “overt” thyroid dysfunction to participate in a trial with a placebo group (and that this therefore explains the lack of current evidence on the topic), but the USPSTF disagrees with this position. There are no high-quality data showing that treatment of “overt” thyroid dysfunction in asymptomatic persons affects important health outcomes, such as cardiovascular- and cancer-related morbidity and mortality, fractures, or quality of life and functional status. Given the widespread practice of screening for and treatment of thyroid dysfunction in asymptomatic persons and the absence of high-quality evidence on the effectiveness of this approach, a pressing research need for this field is well-designed randomized treatment trials of subclinical and “overt” thyroid dysfunction versus watchful waiting (with the important caveat that patients would be provided therapy if they became notably symptomatic).
It is clear from the comments received that the current terminology used to describe disorders of the thyroid generates substantial confusion, not only among the public but among clinicians and researchers as well. The terms “thyroid dysfunction” and “thyroid disease” are frequently used interchangeably to encompass all forms of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, regardless of whether the patient has clinical signs or adverse consequences of illness. The term “overt thyroid dysfunction” is particularly misleading given that an “overt” (meaning “done or shown openly; plainly or readily apparent”43) condition is usually associated with obvious signs and symptoms of disease. In the case of thyroid dysfunction, “overt” dysfunction has been defined by biochemical parameters (serum TSH and T4 levels) that may not be associated with clinically evident symptoms or adverse health outcomes. The USPSTF believes that alternative terms are needed to more accurately describe thyroid dysfunction—reserving the term “overt thyroid disease” to describe symptomatic patients who also have persistently abnormal serum TSH and T4 levels.","<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Thyroid gland disorders are among the most common endocrine conditions evaluated and treated by clinicians. Thyroid dysfunction represents a continuum from asymptomatic biochemical changes to clinically symptomatic disease. In rare cases, it can produce life-threatening complications, such as myxedema coma or thyroid storm. .<br /><br /><em>Subclinical hypothyroidism</em>&nbsp;is defined as an asymptomatic condition in which a patient has a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level exceeding the upper threshold of a specified laboratory reference interval (commonly but arbitrarily defined as 4.5 mIU/L) but a normal thyroxine (T4) level.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-dysfunction-screening#citation3"">3</a>&nbsp;Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism are often further classified as having TSH levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L or greater than 10.0 mIU/L. .<br /><br />Despite its name,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism</em>&nbsp;does not require the presence of symptoms and has been defined biochemically by an elevated TSH level and a low T4 level. As such, it encompasses a range of low T4 levels that may (or may not) be associated with a set of relatively subtle and nonspecific clinical symptoms, such as fatigue, feeling cold, weight gain, hair loss, and constipation. <br /><br /><em>Subclinical hyperthyroidism</em>&nbsp;is defined as an asymptomatic condition in which a patient has a serum TSH level below the lower threshold of a specified laboratory reference interval (usually 0.4 mIU/L) but normal T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) levels. Patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism are further classified as having &ldquo;low but detectable&rdquo; (about 0.1 to 0.4 mIU/L) or &ldquo;clearly low&rdquo; or &ldquo;undetectable&rdquo; (&lt;0.1 mIU/L) TSH levels.<br /><br />Despite its name,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;overt&rdquo; hyperthyroidism</em>&nbsp;does not require the presence of symptoms and has been defined biochemically by a low or undetectable TSH level and an elevated T4 or T3 level. When present, symptoms are often relatively nonspecific (for example, weight loss, heart palpitations, heat intolerance, and hyperactivity).<br /><br />For the purposes of this recommendation,&nbsp;<em>thyroid dysfunction</em>&nbsp;is defined as a spectrum of disorders related to the thyroid gland. The spectrum begins with asymptomatic subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. In the middle of the spectrum are asymptomatic &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, defined biochemically by changes in serum TSH and T4 levels. At the end of the spectrum is thyroid disease, which is reserved for symptomatic &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (that is, persistently abnormal serum TSH and T4 levels and clearly associated clinical signs and symptoms that cannot be better explained by another condition).<br /><br />In making its recommendations about clinical preventive services, the USPSTF focuses on asymptomatic populations that do not have known signs or symptoms of disease.</p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>Early detection and treatment of asymptomatic persons with abnormal serum TSH levels with or without abnormal T4 levels may be beneficial because it may prevent longer-term morbidity and mortality from fractures, cancer, or cardiovascular disease. However, widespread screening and treatment of subclinical thyroid dysfunction can also result in harms due to labeling, false-positive results, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment.<br /><br />The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening can detect &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo; serum TSH levels in asymptomatic persons. However, what constitutes an abnormal TSH level is uncertain. Laboratory reference intervals are based on the statistical distribution of TSH levels across the general population (for example, using the 97.5th percentile as an upper boundary for normal) rather than according to the association of a TSH level with symptoms, adverse outcomes, or particular risk factors for disease.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-dysfunction-screening#citation3"">3</a>&nbsp;There is professional disagreement about the appropriate cut points for the lower and upper boundaries of normal TSH levels in the general population and in subgroups, such as older adults, where values differ from the overall population distribution (for example, shifting to a higher range of normal).<br /><br />Accurate interpretation of serum TSH levels is further complicated by measurement variability and the sensitivity of TSH secretion to conditions other than thyroid dysfunction. These issues have led many professional groups to recommend repeating thyroid function tests if the results fall above or below a specified reference interval for confirmation of persistent dysfunction (for example, over 3- to 6-month intervals) in asymptomatic persons before making a diagnosis or considering any treatment strategies, unless the serum TSH level is greater than 10.0 or less than 0.1 mIU/L.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults leads to clinically important benefits. In particular, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine whether screening for thyroid dysfunction reduces cardiovascular disease or related morbidity and mortality. <br /><br />The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for and treatment of thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults does not improve quality of life or provide clinically meaningful improvements in blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), bone mineral density, or lipid levels. It also does not improve cognitive function, at least through the duration of available trials (&ge;1 to 2 years).</p>
<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening for and treatment of thyroid dysfunction. Indirect evidence points to the likelihood of important and frequent harms associated with screening in asymptomatic persons. Foremost among these are frequent false-positive results; the psychological effects of labeling; and a large degree of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of biochemically defined abnormal TSH levels (with or without abnormal serum T4 levels) that may revert to normal, not progress, or never result in health problems even if they do progress, particularly in persons with TSH levels less than 10 mIU/L.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.<br /><br />If clinicians offer screening for thyroid dysfunction to asymptomatic persons, they should first ensure that patients clearly understand the uncertainties surrounding any potential clinical benefit of screening as well as the possibility of harm this choice may engender.</p>",Screening for Thyroid Dysfunction,"Thyroid Dysfunction, Screening, 2015"
"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to adults aged 18 years or older, including pregnant women. The USPSTF previously issued a separate recommendation statement on primary care interventions for tobacco use in children and adolescents (available online at <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>). Although the USPSTF acknowledges that tobacco may be used in other forms and that other substances aside from tobacco may be smoked, they are not the focus of this recommendation.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
According to the 2012&ndash;2013 National Adult Tobacco Survey, smoking prevalence is higher in the following groups: men; adults aged 25 to 44 years; persons with a race or ethnicity category of &ldquo;other, non-Hispanic&rdquo;; persons with a GED (vs. graduate-level education); persons with an annual household income of less than $20,000; and persons who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.&nbsp;Higher rates of smoking have been found in persons with mental health conditions.
<h3>Implementation Considerations of Behavioral and Pharmacotherapy Interventions</h3>
The information that follows on the implementation of interventions for smoking cessation draws from the USPSTF systematic evidence review&nbsp;and the 2008 Public Health Service guidelines.
<h4>Assessment of Smoking Status</h4>
The 5 A&rsquo;s framework (available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/clinicians-providers/guidelines-recommendations/tobacco/5steps.html"" target=""_blank"">www.ahrq.gov/professionals/clinicians-providers/guidelines-recommendations/tobacco/5steps.html</a>) is a useful strategy for engaging patients in discussions about smoking cessation. This program includes the following: 1) Asking every patient about tobacco use, 2) Advising all tobacco users to quit, 3) Assessing their willingness to attempt to quit, 4) Assisting with attempts to quit, and 5) Arranging follow-up.&nbsp;&ldquo;Ask, Advise, Refer&rdquo; is another approach and involves asking patients about tobacco use, advising those who smoke to quit, and referring them to evidence-based interventions. Treating smoking status as a vital sign and recording smoking status at every health visit are also frequently used to assess smoking status. Because many pregnant women who smoke do not report it, using multiple-choice questions to assess smoking status in this group may improve disclosure.
<h4>Nonpregnant Adults</h4>
Both intervention types (pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions) are effective and recommended; combinations of interventions are most effective, and all should be offered. The best and most effective combinations are those that are acceptable to and feasible for an individual patient; clinicians should consider the patient&rsquo;s specific medical history and preferences and offer and provide the combination that works best for the patient.
<h5>Many behavioral interventions are available to encourage smoking cessation in adults. These interventions can be delivered in the primary care setting or can be referred to community settings with feedback to the primary care provider. Effective behavioral interventions include in-person behavioral support and counseling, telephone counseling, and self-help materials (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/tobacco-use-in-adults-and-pregnant-women-counseling-and-interventions1#tab"">Table</a>). Behavioral interventions may increase rates of smoking abstinence from a baseline range of approximately 5% to 11% in control groups to 7% to 13% in intervention groups.</h5>
<ul>
<li>Both minimal (&lt;20 minutes in 1 visit) and intensive (&ge;20 minutes plus &gt;1 follow-up visit) physician-advice interventions effectively increase the proportion of adults who successfully quit smoking and remain abstinent for at least 6 months.</li>
<li>Brief, in-person behavioral counseling sessions (&lt;10 minutes) effectively increase the proportion of adults who successfully quit smoking and remain abstinent for 1 year. Although less effective than longer interventions, even minimal interventions (&lt;3 minutes) have increased cessation rates in some studies.
<ul>
<li>There is a dose&ndash;response relationship between the intensity of counseling and cessation rates (that is, more or longer sessions improve cessation rates).
<ul>
<li>Several sessions should be provided; according to the Public Health Service guidelines, patients should receive at least 4 in-person counseling sessions.</li>
<li>Cessation rates may plateau after 90 minutes of total counseling contact time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Effective interventions can be delivered by various types of primary care providers, including physicians, nurses, psychologists, social workers, and cessation counselors.</li>
<li>Both individual and group counseling are effective.</li>
<li>Effective counseling interventions provide social support and training in practical problem-solving skills.
<ul>
<li>Training in problem-solving skills includes helping persons who smoke to recognize situations that increase their risk for smoking, develop coping skills to overcome common barriers to quitting, and develop a plan to quit.</li>
<li>Basic information about smoking and successful quitting should be provided.</li>
<li>Complementary practices that improve cessation rates include motivational interviewing, assessing readiness to change, and offering more intensive counseling or referrals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Telephone counseling interventions are effective.
<ul>
<li>Effective interventions provide at least 3 telephone calls.</li>
<li>Telephone counseling can be provided by professional counselors or health care providers who are trained to offer advice over the telephone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Providing self-help materials (primarily print-based) that are tailored to the individual patient (that is, beyond a brochure that simply describes the health effects of smoking) is also effective in improving smoking abstinence.&nbsp;Evidence on nontailored, print-based, self-help materials; computer-based programs; and mobile phone&ndash;based interventions (such as mHEALTH) is mixed, although several trials show promise.
<h5>Pharmacotherapy</h5>
<ul>
<li>The only pharmacotherapy interventions approved by the FDA for the treatment of tobacco dependence in adults are bupropion SR, varenicline, and NRT (including nicotine transdermal patches, lozenges, gum, inhalers, or nasal spray).</li>
<li>Evidence suggests that rates of smoking abstinence may increase from approximately 10% in control groups (placebo or no pharmacotherapy) to 17% in persons using any form of NRT, from roughly 11% in control groups (placebo or no bupropion SR) to 19% in those using bupropion SR, and from approximately 12% in control groups (placebo) to 28% in those using varenicline.

Information for consumers on FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation is available at <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm198176.htm"" target=""_blank"">www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm198176.htm</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Combinations of Pharmacotherapy</h5>
<ul>
<li>Using 2 types of NRT has been found to be more effective than using a single type. In particular, there was evidence that combining a nicotine patch with a rapid-delivery form of NRT is more effective than using a single type.</li>
<li>Some studies suggest that NRT in combination with bupropion SR may be more efficacious than bupropion SR alone but not necessarily NRT alone.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Combinations of Behavioral and Pharmacotherapy Interventions</h5>
<ul>
<li>Combining behavioral and pharmacotherapy interventions may increase cessation rates from approximately 8% to 14%&nbsp;compared with usual care or minimal behavioral interventions (such as self-help materials or brief advice on quitting).
<ul>
<li>These combination interventions often have behavioral components delivered by specialized cessation counselors or trained staff and often use NRT.</li>
<li>Combination interventions often involve several sessions (&ge;4) and tend to be more successful with more sessions.
<ul>
<li>The largest effect was found in interventions that provided 8 or more sessions, although the difference in effect among the number of sessions was not significant.</li>
<li>Contact time ranged from 0 to greater than 300 minutes; interventions lasting 91 to 300 minutes were most common.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>The addition of behavioral support to pharmacotherapy also significantly increased cessation rates from approximately 18% in persons using pharmacotherapy alone to 21% in those using a combination of pharmacotherapy and behavioral support.</li>
<li>Intensity of behavioral support ranged from 0 to greater than 300 minutes of contact; interventions most often involved greater than 91 minutes of contact (roughly 40% were 91 to 300 minutes, and 60% were &gt;300 minutes).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pregnant Women</h4>
<h5>Behavioral Interventions</h5>
<ul>
<li>Effective behavioral interventions in pregnant women who smoke include counseling, feedback, health education, incentives, and social support. Compared with usual care or controls, behavioral interventions can increase rates of smoking abstinence from approximately 11% to 15% in pregnant women.</li>
<li>Effective behavioral interventions provided more intensive counseling than minimal advice and other standard components of usual care.</li>
<li>Counseling sessions augmented with messages and self-help materials tailored for pregnant women who smoke increased abstinence rates during pregnancy compared with brief, generic counseling interventions alone.
<ul>
<li>Counseling specific to pregnant women should include messages about the effects of smoking on both maternal and fetal health and clear, strong advice to quit as soon as possible. Although smoking cessation at any point during pregnancy yields substantial health benefits for the expectant mother and baby, quitting early in pregnancy provides the greatest benefit to the fetus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Other Interventions</h4>
Health care system&ndash;based strategies that have been shown to improve rates of clinical interventions for smoking cessation in primary care settings include implementing an identification system for tobacco users; providing education, resources, and feedback to promote clinician intervention; and dedicating staff to provide treatment for tobacco dependence and assessing the delivery of this treatment in staff performance evaluations.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
Primary care clinicians may find the following resources useful in talking with adults and pregnant women about smoking cessation: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fact sheets on quitting smoking (<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/cessation/quitting/index.htm"" target=""_blank"">www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/cessation/quitting/index.htm</a>), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&rsquo; BeTobaccoFree (<a href=""http://betobaccofree.hhs.gov/quit-now/index.html#professionals"" target=""_blank"">http://betobaccofree.hhs.gov/quit-now/index.html#professionals</a>), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&rsquo; SmokeFreeWomen (<a href=""http://women.smokefree.gov/pregnancy-motherhood.aspx"" target=""_blank"">http://women.smokefree.gov/pregnancy-motherhood.aspx</a>), and the Public Health Service&rsquo;s 2008 clinical practice guidelines. <br /><br />In addition, the following resources may be useful to primary care clinicians and practices trying to implement interventions for smoking cessation: the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration&ndash;Health Resources and Services Administration Center for Integrated Health Solutions&rsquo; resources for smoking cessation (<a href=""http://www.integration.samhsa.gov/health-wellness/wellness-strategies/tobacco-cessation-2"" target=""_blank"">www.integration.samhsa.gov/health-wellness/wellness-strategies/tobacco-cessation-2</a>), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state and community resources for tobacco-control programs (<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/stateandcommunity/index.htm"" target=""_blank"">www.cdc.gov/tobacco/stateandcommunity/index.htm</a>), and the World Health Organization&rsquo;s toolkit for delivering brief smoking interventions in primary care (<a href=""http://www.who.int/tobacco/publications/smoking_cessation/9789241506953/en"" target=""_blank"">www.who.int/tobacco/publications/smoking_cessation/9789241506953/en</a>).
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statements</h3>
<h4>Pharmacotherapy for Pregnant Women</h4>
Although smoking prevalence is lower in pregnant women than nonpregnant women of the same age, approximately 1 in 6 pregnant women aged 15 to 44 years smoke.&nbsp;Smoking during pregnancy slows fetal growth, doubles the risk for delivering a baby with low birthweight, and increases the risk for fetal death by 25% to 50%. For women in whom behavioral counseling does not work, other options to promote smoking cessation may be beneficial. <br /><br />A few studies have evaluated the benefit of NRT on perinatal and child health outcomes. Although results generally suggest a potential benefit, the overall evidence is too limited to draw clear conclusions. Nicotine replacement therapy is a pregnancy category D medication, which means that there is positive evidence of fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans. However, it has been suggested that NRT may be safer than smoking during pregnancy.&nbsp;Potential adverse events reported include increased rates of cesarean delivery, slightly increased diastolic blood pressure, and skin reactions to the patch. Potential adverse events reported in nonpregnant adults include higher rates of low-risk cardiovascular events, such as tachycardia. There is no evidence of perinatal harms from NRT, although few trials reported consistently on these adverse events.<br /><br />The USPSTF identified no studies on bupropion SR or varenicline pharmacotherapy during pregnancy. These drugs are both pregnancy category C, which means that animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus but there are no adequate well-controlled studies in humans.<br /><br />In the absence of clear evidence on the balance of benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy in pregnant women, clinicians are encouraged to consider the severity of smoking behavior in each patient and engage in shared decision making to determine the best individual treatment course.
<h4>ENDS</h4>
Approximately 69% of adults who smoke daily report interest in quitting, and roughly 43% attempted to quit in the previous year.&nbsp;To date, no ENDS manufacturer has applied for or received FDA approval to market its product for smoking cessation purposes. According to a small 2013 study, approximately two thirds of physicians reported that they believed that electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) were a helpful aid for smoking cessation, and 35% recommended them to patients.&nbsp;A recent small survey of e-cigarette users found that 56% reported using them to quit or reduce cigarette use, and 26% reported using them to smoke in places where conventional cigarettes were banned.&nbsp;Because of the perception by the public and clinicians that ENDS may be used for quitting conventional smoking, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence in this area. No studies evaluated the use of ENDS for smoking cessation in pregnant women or adolescents. The USPSTF identified only 2 RCTs that evaluated the effect of e-cigarettes on smoking abstinence in adults and found mixed results. Neither study reported any serious adverse events related to ENDS use; however, potential concerns raised in other literature include the unknown safety and toxicity of their components and aerosols,&nbsp;and poisoning in children who mishandle nicotine cartridges.&nbsp;How the ingredients in ENDS may affect a fetus is also unknown. Overall, the USPSTF found the evidence on the use of ENDS as a smoking cessation tool in adults, including pregnant women, and adolescents to be insufficient.
<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>
Given the public health significance of the consequences of tobacco use, numerous public health interventions aim to prevent tobacco use and promote smoking cessation. The Community Preventive Services Task Force offers several recommendations on interventions that can be used in community settings (available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.thecommunityguide.org/tobacco/index.html"" target=""_blank"">www.thecommunityguide.org/tobacco/index.html</a>). The Surgeon General&rsquo;s report, &ldquo;The Health Consequences of Smoking&mdash;50 Years of Progress,&rdquo; discusses initiatives to end the tobacco use epidemic in the United States.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/tobacco-use-in-adults-and-pregnant-women-counseling-and-interventions1#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;In addition, the USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians provide interventions, including education or brief counseling, to prevent the initiation of tobacco use among school-aged children and adolescents (available at<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).<br /><br /><strong><br /></strong>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
A large body of evidence on interventions for smoking cessation already exists, and the overall benefit of pharmacotherapy and behavioral counseling to promote smoking cessation is well-established. However, further research is still needed to elucidate specific effective features of complex behavioral counseling interventions, benefits of pharmacotherapy in specific subpopulations, and the efficacy of newer technology-based interventions. Although numerous behavioral interventions for smoking cessation are available to primary care clinicians, further research is needed to better clarify the effects of varying levels of intensity (such as how the number of sessions and number of minutes per session affect continuous abstinence rates), which settings of behavioral counseling interventions are most conducive to quitting (individual vs. group, health vs. community, and primary care vs. specialty), and ways to tailor self-help materials. Further research is needed on the benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy in specific subpopulations, such as pregnant women and adults with mental health conditions. Research that directly compares types of pharmacotherapy in different populations may help inform providers on which interventions to use with which patients. Additional research is also needed on interventions for light or nondaily smokers and to better understand the effectiveness of newer technology platforms for interventions for smoking cessation, such as Internet-based programs, mobile or smartphone applications, and text-messaging programs. Although no ENDS manufacturer has applied to the FDA to have its product approved as a therapeutic device, because of the perception by both the public and clinicians that ENDS may be used as an option for quitting conventional smoking, further research is needed on the safety, benefits, and harms of ENDS.<br /><br />",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/tobacco-use-in-adults-and-pregnant-women-counseling-and-interventions1#Pod5,153,"Numerous professional societies and health organizations, including the American College of Physicians,&nbsp;American College of Preventive Medicine,&nbsp;American Heart Association,&nbsp;and American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&nbsp;recommend that clinicians screen for tobacco use and provide interventions to patients who smoke. More recently, with the emergence and increased use of e-cigarettes, some organizations have incorporated statements about e-cigarettes into their guidelines. Both the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&nbsp;and the American Heart Association&nbsp;recommend that e-cigarettes be included in smoking screening questions. The American Heart Association also concludes that evidence is insufficient to counsel patients on the use of e-cigarettes as a primary cessation aid. The American Academy of Family Physicians has updated its recommendations, which are consistent with those of the USPSTF.","Burden of Disease
Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in the United States. Smoking increases the risk for all-cause mortality and has been found to increase risk for various types of cancer (such as lung, liver, and colorectal), respiratory diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and tuberculosis), cardiovascular disease (such as stroke from secondhand smoke), diabetes, impaired immune function and autoimmune disease (such as rheumatoid arthritis), eye disease (such as age-related macular degeneration), and erectile dysfunction in men. Smoking early in pregnancy has been found to cause ectopic pregnancy and orofacial clefts in infants.1
According to National Health Interview Survey data from 2013, a total of 42.1 million adults in the United States (17.8%) smokes cigarettes.5 Rates are higher among men; adults aged 24 to 44 years; lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender adults; multiracial groups and American Indians or Alaska Natives; persons whose highest education level attained is a GED; and persons living below the poverty level.5 Adults with mental health conditions have higher smoking rates and tend to smoke a higher average number of cigarettes than adults without mental health conditions. Approximately 27% of persons with a mental health or substance use disorder smoke.17
Based on data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System, 23.2% of women smoked during the 3 months before conception.18 Data from 2011 showed that 55% of women quit smoking during pregnancy, roughly 10% of pregnant women smoked during the last 3 months of pregnancy, and 40% of women relapsed within 6 months of delivery.19 Smoking during pregnancy is associated with fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, and sudden infant death syndrome. Prenatal smoking contributed to an estimated 5.3% to 7.7% of preterm deliveries, 13.1% to 19.0% of low-birthweight term deliveries, 23.2% to 33.6% of cases of sudden infant death syndrome, and 5.0% to 7.3% of preterm-related deaths in 2002.1
Quitting smoking is one of the most important and yet challenging preventive health measures a person can take to improve his or her health. Most smokers make several serious attempts to quit before achieving permanent abstinence.
Scope of Review
The current review focused on appraising evidence on interventions for smoking cessation that are relevant to primary care (behavioral interventions, pharmacotherapy, and complementary or alternative therapy) in adults, including pregnant women. Only pharmacotherapy interventions that were approved by the FDA as first-line agents for smoking cessation were included (NRT, bupropion SR, and varenicline). Health outcomes included all-cause mortality, tobacco-related mortality and morbidity, and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Smoking-cessation outcomes had to be reported at 6 months or later to be included; findings on smoking reduction (based on frequency or quantity only), intention to quit, and cessation at less than 6 months were excluded. The USPSTF also evaluated adverse events reported at any time point.
Effectiveness of Interventions
Nonpregnant Adults
Behavioral Interventions
The USPSTF reviewed 11 good- or fair-quality systematic reviews on behavioral interventions, including complementary or alternative therapies, and smoking-cessation outcomes.8 Evidence on increasing smoking abstinence was strongest for physician and nurse advice, tailored self-help materials, and telephone counseling. Based on a 2013 systematic review of 28 studies (n = 22,239),20 rates of smoking abstinence at 6 months or more were 8.0% in groups that received physician advice compared with 4.8% in groups that received no advice or usual care (risk ratio [RR], 1.76 [95% CI, 1.56 to 1.96]). Based on pooled analyses of 35 studies from a 2013 systematic review that evaluated advice delivered by nurses, 13.3% of participants who received interventions from nurses achieved smoking abstinence at 6 months or more compared with 11.3% of those who received usual care or minimal intervention (RR, 1.29 [CI, 1.20 to 1.39]).21 When stratified by intensity level, both minimal advice (defined as a single session lasting <20 minutes with ≤1 follow-up session) and intensive advice (defined as a single session lasting ≥20 minutes or >1 follow-up session) from a physician significantly increased cessation rates compared with no advice. In a subset of 15 trials that directly compared intensive versus minimal advice from physicians, intensive advice significantly increased smoking abstinence compared with minimal advice (RR, 1.37 [CI, 1.20 to 1.56]).20 Based on pooled analyses of 32 studies from a 2014 review of print-based self-help materials (n = 40,890), participants who received tailored self-help materials showed a significantly higher rate of smoking abstinence at 6 months or more than control participants (7.1% vs. 5.8%; RR, 1.28 [CI, 1.18 to 1.37]). However, no significant improvement was seen when nontailored materials were compared with no self-help materials (RR, 1.06 [CI, 0.98 to 1.16]), based on pooled analyses of 33 studies (n = 29,495).22 A 2013 review on telephone counseling interventions found that recruiter-initiated telephone support improved rates of smoking cessation at 6 months or more.23 Based on pooled analyses of 12 studies (n = 30,182), abstinence rates were significantly higher in participants who received several counseling sessions via a telephone quit line than in those who received only a single session or self-help materials (10.7% vs. 7.6%; RR, 1.41 [CI, 1.20 to 1.66]). Pooled analyses of 51 studies (n = 30,246) found that recruiter-initiated telephone counseling that did not result from patients’ calls to help lines also showed a benefit on smoking abstinence rates at 6 months or more compared with controls (13.1% vs. 9.7%; RR, 1.27 [CI, 1.20 to 1.36]).
The USPSTF also reviewed the 2008 Public Health Service guidelines on treating tobacco use and dependence for additional details on intensity and content of behavioral interventions, as well as type of staff providing counseling for smoking cessation.9 The USPSTF also considered evidence from additional reviews on mobile phone and Internet-based interventions.8 Although findings suggested a benefit, there were too few studies and the studies were too heterogeneous to draw definitive conclusions. The USPSTF also considered evidence from reviews on biomedical risk assessment interventions, exercise, and hypnotherapy for smoking cessation; the studies were too limited to draw conclusions.8 A 2014 review on the use of acupuncture for smoking cessation (9 studies; n = 1892) did not find increased rates of smoking cessation at 6 to 12 months.24
Pharmacotherapy
The USPSTF reviewed 3 good-quality systematic reviews on pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults.8
A 2012 systematic review on NRT (117 studies; n = 51,265)25 found that 17.3% of participants taking any form of NRT achieved abstinence at 6 months or more compared with 10.3% of participants receiving placebo or taking no NRT (RR, 1.60 [CI, 1.53 to 1.68]). Those who used 2 forms of NRT achieved higher abstinence rates than those who used just 1 (20.6% vs. 15.6%; RR, 1.34 [CI, 1.18 to 1.51]). All studies of dual NRT used the patch plus another type of NRT (such as gum, nasal spray, or inhaler), although which form served as the control varied. All single forms of NRT significantly improved cessation rates at 6 months or more (gum: RR, 1.49 [CI, 1.40 to 1.60]; patch: RR, 1.64 [CI, 1.52 to 1.78]; tablets or lozenges: RR, 1.95 [CI, 1.61 to 2.36]).
A 2014 systematic review on the use of antidepressants for smoking cessation (44 studies; n = 13,728) found that bupropion SR was associated with a significantly higher rate of smoking abstinence at 6 months or more than placebo or no bupropion SR (19.7% vs. 11.5%; RR, 1.62 [CI, 1.49 to 1.76]).26
Based on a smaller number of studies (14 studies; n = 6166), a 2012 systematic review27 found that varenicline was associated with a higher cessation rate than placebo (28.0% vs. 12.0%; RR, 2.27 [CI, 2.02 to 2.55]).
Pooled analyses found that NRT plus bupropion SR was more effective than bupropion SR alone (RR, 1.24 [CI, 1.06 to 1.45]; 4 studies; n = 1991); however, it was not more effective than NRT alone (RR, 1.19 [CI, 0.94 to 1.51]; 12 studies).8
Smaller subsets of studies from these reviews directly compared types of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. Abstinence rates among participants using NRT versus bupropion SR at 6 months or more did not significantly differ (8 studies; n = 4086).26 Two studies (n = 778) compared NRT and varenicline and found no significant difference between groups.27 Four studies evaluated bupropion SR versus varenicline; although not all of the studies found a significant difference, a pooled estimate (n = 1810) found a lower cessation rate with bupropion SR than varenicline (RR, 0.68 [CI, 0.56 to 0.83]).
Combinations of Behavioral Interventions and Pharmacotherapy
Combinations of behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation were also effective.8 A 2012 good-quality systematic review (40 studies; n = 15,021)28 found that participants who received combination pharmacotherapy and intensive behavioral counseling had a higher abstinence rate at 6 months or more compared with control participants who received usual care, self-help materials, or brief advice on quitting (which was less intensive than the counseling or support given to the intervention groups) (14.5% vs. 8.3%; RR, 1.82 [CI, 1.66 to 2.00]). Most studies (27 of 40) used NRT as the pharmacotherapy and offered at least 4 behavioral counseling sessions (33 of 41). Another good-quality systematic review29 found that abstinence rates at 6 months or more were higher in participants who received behavioral support as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy than in those who received pharmacotherapy alone (21.4% vs. 18.3%; RR, 1.16 [CI, 1.09 to 1.24]). Most studies (27 of 38) offered NRT alone as the pharmacotherapy. Participants in the control group may have also received some counseling or support, but it was less intensive than in the intervention group. Most studies (28 of 38) offered at least 91 minutes of total contact time, and many (16 of 38) offered greater than 300 minutes.
ENDS
The USPSTF identified only 2 fair-quality RCTs that reported on the effects of e-cigarettes for stopping conventional cigarette smoking.8 One study30 of persons not attempting or wishing to quit found a higher abstinence rate at 12 months in participants using e-cigarettes than in control participants (11.0% vs. 4%; P = 0.04), whereas a larger study found no significant difference in abstinence rates at 6 months.31 Neither trial was conducted in the United States.
Pregnant Women
Behavioral Interventions
Based on a good-quality systematic review of 86 studies done in 2013,8, 32 the USPSTF found that behavioral interventions in pregnant women (including behavioral counseling, feedback, health education, incentives, and social support) are effective at improving rates of smoking cessation as well as perinatal health outcomes. Compared with control participants (most often defined as usual care or less intensive interventions), pregnant women who received any type of behavioral intervention before the third trimester had higher cessation rates late in pregnancy (15.2% vs. 11.2%; RR, 1.45 [CI, 1.27 to 1.64]). Their children also had improved mean birthweight (mean difference, 40.78 g [CI, 18.45 to 63.10 g]), rates of low birthweight (RR, 0.82 [CI, 0.71 to 0.94]), and rates of preterm birth (RR, 0.82 [CI, 0.70 to 0.96]). When analyzed separately, behavioral counseling (the behavioral intervention in most studies) was effective in increasing abstinence rates in late pregnancy and mean birthweight in infants.
Pharmacotherapy
The USPSTF found a much smaller body of evidence on pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in pregnant women. Only 5 RCTs (n = 11,922) evaluating NRT use were found; there were no published trials on the use of bupropion SR or varenicline as an intervention for smoking cessation in pregnant women.8 The NRT studies reported very low (as low as <25%) adherence rates, which limited the interpretability of findings. Meta-analysis of these 5 trials showed no significant improvement in rates of smoking abstinence late in pregnancy (10.8% vs. 8.5%; RR, 1.24 [CI, 0.95 to 1.64]). Given the small number of studies that reported on perinatal health outcomes, meta-analysis was not done. Although results on preterm birth were mostly in the direction of benefit, only 1 study33 showed a significant benefit. Reported results on mean birthweight and stillbirth were mixed. The largest trial (n = 1050) reported a higher rate of survival with no impairment at 2 years in children whose mothers received NRT during pregnancy.34
Potential Harms of Interventions
Nonpregnant Adults
Behavioral Interventions
Evidence on harms of behavioral interventions for smoking cessation is limited. Based on the evidence reviewed by the USPSTF, only minor adverse events related to ear acupuncture, ear acupressure, and other auriculotherapy were identified. Adverse events related to other forms of behavioral interventions were not reported.
Pharmacotherapy
A 2014 fair-quality systematic review35 of 21 studies (n = 11,647) found that NRT use was associated with a higher rate of all cardiovascular adverse events (RR, 1.81 [CI, 1.35 to 2.43]) compared with placebo. This result seems to be driven by minor events, such as tachycardia and arrhythmia. No significant increase in major cardiovascular adverse events was found (RR, 1.38 [CI, 0.58 to 3.26]). An older fair-quality review from 201036 also found higher rates of heart palpitation and chest pain, nausea and vomiting, gastrointestinal symptoms, and insomnia in NRT users than control participants. The patch was associated with an increase in skin irritation, and oral NRT was associated with throat soreness, mouth ulcers, and hiccups. Based on a subset of 8 studies, this older review also found no difference in mortality rates in participants using NRT versus control participants (odds ratio, 0.74 [CI, 0.33 to 1.67]).
The same systematic review also evaluated the potential harms of bupropion SR for smoking cessation (27 studies; n = 10,02).35 No significant difference was found between groups using bupropion SR versus placebo in all cardiovascular adverse events (RR, 1.03 [CI, 0.71 to 1.50]). A trend toward reduction in major cardiovascular adverse events was found in the bupropion SR group (RR, 0.57 [CI, 0.31 to 1.04]). A good-quality review (33 studies; n = 9631) found an increased rate of serious adverse events in bupropion SR users versus those using placebo or controls that was of borderline significance (RR, 1.30 [CI, 1.00 to 1.69]).26 On the basis of 19 studies,8 the current USPSTF review found no significant increase in serious psychiatric events with bupropion SR (RR, 0.60 [CI, 0.28 to 1.28]). It found 10 reported cases of seizures among 13,000 study participants. Bupropion SR labels include a boxed warning about serious neuropsychiatric events in persons who take bupropion SR for smoking cessation.
Concerns have been raised about varenicline and potential cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric harms. In 2012, the FDA issued a safety communication indicating a nonsignificant increase in major adverse cardiovascular events.37 Based on a fair-quality systematic review done in 2014,35 a meta-analysis of 18 studies (n = 9072) showed no significant increase in all cardiovascular adverse events (RR, 1.24 [CI, 0.85 to 1.81]) or major cardiovascular adverse events (RR, 1.44 [CI, 0.73 to 2.83]). Varenicline labels contain a boxed warning about serious neuropsychiatric events; however, none of the evidence reviewed by the USPSTF reported on this outcome. A good-quality systematic review done in 201227 found an increased risk for 1 or more serious adverse events in participants using varenicline compared with those receiving placebo (RR, 1.36 [CI, 1.03 to 1.81]), but the type of serious adverse event was not specified. Most recently, the FDA issued a warning and approved updated labeling to describe a potential but rare occurrence of seizures with varenicline use and a potential interaction between varenicline and alcohol.38
Combinations of Behavioral Interventions and Pharmacotherapy
The USPSTF did not identify any reports of adverse events related to combinations of behavioral interventions and pharmacotherapy.
ENDS
Neither of the 2 trials on e-cigarette use for conventional smoking cessation reported any serious adverse events related to product use or any difference in the frequency of adverse events.8 One study30 reported a higher number of serious adverse events in the nicotine e-cigarette group (27 [19.7%]) than in the nicotine patch group (14 [11.8%]). However, the authors stated that they did not find any evidence on an association with the study product, and there was no difference in overall incidence of adverse events (serious and nonserious) between groups (incidence rate ratio, 1.05 [CI, 0.82 to 1.34]). Although it was not reported in the 2 trials, concerns have been raised about potentially harmful ingredients in e-cigarettes.14, 15 Because of the large number and variation of available devices and cartridge fluids and the lack of regulation, the toxicity and safety of e-cigarettes and ENDS are extremely difficult to determine uniformly.8 Inadvertent poisoning in children who mishandle nicotine cartridges is also a concern, and the number of calls to poison centers involving nicotine-containing e-cigarette liquids has increased from 1 per month in 2010 to 215 per month in 2014.16 Based on estimates from a recent small survey, dual use of e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes may be high: 9.4% of persons who smoke conventional cigarettes reported concurrently using e-cigarettes, and 76.8% of persons who use e-cigarettes reported concurrently smoking conventional cigarettes.39 Further research is needed to better understand how dual use of e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes may affect attempts at cessation and initiation of smoking.
Pregnant Women
Behavioral Interventions
The USPSTF did not find any serious adverse events related to behavioral interventions for smoking cessation in pregnant women. According to 1 systematic review,32 an increase in smoking was reported in 4 out of 86 studies.
Pharmacotherapy
Evidence on harms from pharmacotherapy interventions for smoking cessation in pregnant women is limited. The USPSTF found no evidence of perinatal harms, although the number of studies was low and they were underpowered for rare outcomes.8 Similarly, there were too few studies to make any definitive determination on maternal harms of NRT. Maternal harms of NRT that have been reported in some studies include increased rates of cesarean delivery, slightly increased blood pressure (1 study reported an increase of 0.02 mm Hg per day in diastolic blood pressure over time,40 and skin reaction to the NRT patch.8
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
Nonpregnant Adults
Behavioral Interventions
The USPSTF found convincing evidence that behavioral interventions (such as physician and nurse advice, tailored self-help materials, and telephone counseling) provided or referred to by primary care providers substantially improve achievement of smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that there are no harms of behavioral interventions. The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of providing behavioral interventions for smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults is substantial.
Pharmacotherapy
The USPSTF found convincing evidence that pharmacotherapy with NRT, bupropion SR, or varenicline substantially improves achievement of smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults. Evidence is also convincing that using 2 types of NRT moderately improves achievement of smoking cessation over single forms and that the addition of NRT to treatment with bupropion SR provides additional benefit over use of bupropion SR alone. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of pharmacotherapy, including serious cardiovascular adverse events and neuropsychiatric events, are small. It concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of providing pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults is substantial.
Combinations of Behavioral and Pharmacotherapy Interventions
The USPSTF found convincing evidence that combinations of behavioral plus pharmacotherapy interventions substantially increase achievement of smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of combined interventions are small. The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of providing combined interventions for smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults is substantial.
ENDS
The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence on the use of ENDS for conventional smoking cessation is insufficient. Evidence is lacking and conflicting, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. Given the established safety and effectiveness of behavioral and pharmacotherapy interventions, the USPSTF recommends that primary care providers direct patients who smoke to these other interventions.
Pregnant Women
Behavioral Interventions
The USPSTF found convincing evidence that behavioral interventions (such as behavioral counseling, feedback, health education, incentives, and social support) substantially improve achievement of smoking cessation in pregnant women, increase birthweight, and decrease preterm birth in their children. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that there are no harms of behavioral interventions and concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of providing behavioral interventions for smoking cessation in pregnant women is substantial.
Pharmacotherapy
The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence on pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in pregnant women is insufficient. Evidence on NRT is limited and conflicting, evidence on other forms of pharmacotherapy is lacking, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 5 May to 1 June 2015. Several comments requested clarification about which types of interventions are being recommended—pharmacotherapy, behavioral interventions, or combinations of both. Several comments also expressed concern that the draft language for the recommendation may cause clinicians to offer only 1 type of intervention. The USPSTF clarified that both intervention types (pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions) are effective and recommended; combinations of interventions are most effective, and all should be offered. The best and most effective combinations are those that are acceptable to and feasible for an individual patient. Clinicians should consider the patient’s specific medical history and preferences and offer and provide the combination that works best for that patient. Comments also sought clarification about which populations are included in the I statement for ENDS; the USPSTF clarified that the I statement for ENDS includes pregnant women. A few comments requested additional implementation resources. The USPSTF revised the recommendation to include a table that highlights effective components of behavioral interventions and provided links to additional resources on pharmacotherapy options and resources for pregnant women. The USPSTF revised its language on ENDS to reflect current terminology.
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
Because of the well-established health benefits of smoking cessation,1, 9 most of the research on interventions for smoking cessation focuses on cessation (rather than health outcomes) as a primary outcome. The current review identified 1 study of middle-aged men at high risk for cardiorespiratory disease that found a significantly smaller number of deaths from respiratory illness at 33 years of follow-up in participants who received advice from medical practitioners. The study also found favorable effects on all-cause mortality, coronary disease mortality, and lung cancer incidence and mortality at 20 years of follow-up, although these effects were not significant.41","<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in the United States. Cigarette smoking results in more than 480,000 premature deaths each year and accounts for approximately 1 in every 5 deaths.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/tobacco-use-in-adults-and-pregnant-women-counseling-and-interventions1#citation1"">1</a> In pregnant women, smoking increases the risk for congenital anomalies; perinatal complications, such as preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and placental abruption; miscarriage and stillbirth; and neonatal or pediatric complications, such as sudden infant death syndrome and impaired lung function in childhood.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/tobacco-use-in-adults-and-pregnant-women-counseling-and-interventions1#citation1"">1-4</a> An estimated 42.1 million U.S. adults (nearly 18% of the population) currently smoke.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/tobacco-use-in-adults-and-pregnant-women-counseling-and-interventions1#citation5"">5</a></p>
<h3>Recognition of Behavior</h3>
<p>The benefits of assessing patients&rsquo; smoking behavior are well-established. Common approaches for clinicians include recording a patient&rsquo;s smoking status as a vital sign or using the 5 A&rsquo;s: 1) Ask about smoking; 2) Advise to quit through clear, personalized messages; 3) Assess willingness to quit; 4) Assist in quitting; and 5) Arrange follow-up and support. Another approach is &ldquo;Ask, Advise, Refer,&rdquo; which encourages clinicians to ask patients about tobacco use, advise them to quit, and refer them to telephone quit lines and/or other evidence-based cessation interventions.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Interventions</h3>
<h4>Nonpregnant Adults</h4>
<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that behavioral interventions (including in-person behavioral support and counseling, telephone counseling, and self-help materials) alone or combined with pharmacotherapy substantially improve achievement of tobacco cessation in nonpregnant adults who smoke. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that pharmacotherapy interventions, including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion hydrochloride sustained-release (buproprion SR), and varenicline&mdash;with or without behavioral counseling interventions&mdash;substantially improve achievement of tobacco cessation in nonpregnant adults who smoke. The USPSTF also found convincing evidence that using 2 types of NRT moderately improves achievement of tobacco smoking cessation over using 1 type and that addition of NRT to treatment with bupropion SR provides additional benefit over use of bupropion SR alone. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine the effect of ENDS on achievement of tobacco smoking cessation.</p>
<h4>Pregnant Women</h4>
<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that behavioral interventions substantially improve achievement of tobacco smoking abstinence in pregnant women, increase infant birthweight, and reduce risk for preterm birth. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits of NRT and no evidence on the benefits of bupropion SR, varenicline, or ENDS to achieve tobacco cessation in pregnant women who smoke or to improve perinatal outcomes in infants.</p>
<h3>Harms of Interventions</h3>
<h4>Nonpregnant Adults</h4>
<p>The USPSTF determined that there is adequate evidence to bound the magnitude of harms of behavioral interventions for tobacco cessation in nonpregnant adults who smoke as small to none. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of NRT, bupropion SR, or varenicline for tobacco cessation in adults who smoke are small. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine the harms of ENDS.</p>

<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of behavioral interventions and FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for tobacco cessation, alone or combined, in nonpregnant adults who smoke is substantial.The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of behavioral interventions for tobacco cessation on perinatal outcomes and smoking abstinence in pregnant women who smoke is substantial.The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on pharmacotherapy interventions for tobacco cessation in pregnant women is insufficient because of a lack of studies, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on the use of ENDS for tobacco smoking cessation in adults, including pregnant women, is insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. The USPSTF has identified the lack of well-designed, randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) on ENDS that report smoking abstinence or adverse events as a critical gap in the evidence.</p>",Behavioral and Pharmacotherapy Interventions for Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults and Pregnant Women,"Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults and Pregnant Women, Behavioral and Pharmacotherapy Interventions, 2015"
"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to adults aged 18 years or older without known hypertension.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
<h4>Office Blood Pressure Measurement</h4>
Office measurement of blood pressure is most commonly done with a manual or automated sphygmomanometer. Little research has been done on the best approach to measuring blood pressure in the office setting. Most clinical trials of hypertension treatment, at a minimum, used the mean of 2 measurements taken while the patient was seated (some used the mean of the second and third measurements), allowed for at least 5 minutes between entry into the office and blood pressure measurement, used an appropriately sized arm cuff, and placed the patient&rsquo;s arm at the level of the right atrium during measurement. Multiple measurements over time have better positive predictive value for hypertension than a single measurement. Automated office blood pressure, which is an average of multiple automated measurements taken while the patient is alone in a room, may yield results similar to those of daytime ABPM.Blood pressure is affected by various short-term factors, such as emotions, stress, pain, physical activity, and drugs (including caffeine and nicotine). In addition to within-patient temporal variability, isolated clinic hypertension in the medical setting and in the presence of medical personnel (known as &ldquo;white coat&rdquo; hypertension) is well-documented. Epidemiologic data suggest that 15% to 30% of the population believed to have hypertension may have lower blood pressure outside of the office setting.&nbsp;The disadvantages of diagnosing hypertension solely in the office setting include measurement errors, the limited number of measurements that can be made conveniently, and the confounding risk for isolated clinic hypertension.
<h4>Ambulatory and Home Blood Pressure Monitoring</h4>
In addition to office blood pressure measurement, ABPM and HBPM may be used to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension after initial screening. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring devices are small, portable machines that record blood pressure at regular intervals over 12 to 24 hours while patients go about their normal activities and while they are sleeping. Measurements are typically taken at 20- to 30-minute intervals. Home blood pressure measurement devices are fully automated oscillometric devices that record measurements taken from the patient&rsquo;s brachial artery. Many of these devices are available for retail purchase, and some have undergone technical validation according to recommended protocols. <br /><br />The USPSTF found convincing evidence that ABPM is the best method for diagnosing hypertension. Although the criteria for establishing hypertension varied across studies, there was significant discordance between the office diagnosis of hypertension and 12- and 24-hour average blood pressures using ABPM, with significantly fewer patients requiring treatment based on ABPM (Figure 1). &nbsp;Elevated ambulatory systolic blood pressure was consistently and significantly associated with increased risk for fatal and nonfatal stroke and cardiovascular events, independent of office blood pressure (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/high-blood-pressure-in-adults-screening#fig2"">Figure 2</a>).&nbsp;For these reasons, the USPSTF recommends ABPM as the reference standard for confirming the diagnosis of hypertension. <br /><br />Good-quality evidence suggests that confirmation of hypertension with HBPM may be acceptable. Several studies showed that elevated home blood pressure was significantly associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events, stroke, and all-cause mortality, independent of office blood pressure (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/high-blood-pressure-in-adults-screening#fig3"">Figure 3</a>).&nbsp;However, fewer studies have compared HBPM with office blood pressure measurement, so the evidence is not as substantial as it is for ABPM.&nbsp;Therefore, the USPSTF considers ABPM to be the reference standard for confirming the diagnosis of hypertension. However, the USPSTF acknowledges that the use of ABPM may be problematic in some situations. Home blood pressure monitoring using appropriate protocols is an alternative method of confirmation if ABPM is not available. Measurements from the office, HBPM, and ABPM all must be interpreted with care and in the context of the individual patient. Patients with very high blood pressure or signs of end-organ damage may need immediate treatment.
<h3>Screening Interval</h3>
The USPSTF recommends annual screening for adults aged 40 years or older and for those who are at increased risk for high blood pressure. Persons at increased risk include those who have high-normal blood pressure (130 to 139/85 to 89 mm Hg), those who are overweight or obese, and African Americans. Adults aged 18 to 39 years with normal blood pressure (&lt;130/85 mm Hg) who do not have other risk factors should be rescreened every 3 to 5 years<em>.</em>&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends rescreening with properly measured office blood pressure and, if blood pressure is elevated, confirming the diagnosis of hypertension with ABPM.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
The benefits of treatment of hypertension in preventing important health outcomes are well-documented. Moderate- to high-quality randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrate the efficacy of treatment of the general population of persons aged 60 years or older to a target blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg in reducing the incidence of stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease events. Similarly, RCTs demonstrate the efficacy of treatment of younger adults to a target diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg in reducing cerebrovascular events, heart failure, and overall mortality. &nbsp;In the absence of sufficient RCT data, expert opinion has been used to establish a target systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg in adults younger than 60 years&nbsp;and some experts believe that this should also be maintained in those aged 60 years or older.&nbsp;However, published results from a recently completed large RCT, the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, are not yet available to inform current treatment goals. Clinicians should consult updated blood pressure treatment guidelines informed by this trial as they become available. <br /><br />For nonblack patients, initial treatment consists of a thiazide diuretic, calcium-channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin-receptor blocker. For black patients, initial treatment is thiazide or a calcium-channel blocker. Initial or add-on treatment for patients with chronic kidney disease consists of either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin-receptor blocker (not both).<br /><br />
<h3>Suggestions for Implementation</h3>
Screening for high blood pressure may be done in the office setting by using the proper methods described previously. However, the USPSTF recommends confirmation outside of the clinical setting before a diagnosis of hypertension is made and treatment is started. Confirmation may be done by using HBPM or ABPM. Because blood pressure is a continuous value with natural variations throughout the day, repeated measurements over time are generally more accurate in establishing a diagnosis of hypertension. The USPSTF did not find evidence for a single gold standard protocol for HBPM or ABPM. However, both may be used in conjunction with proper office measurement to make a diagnosis and guide management and treatment options. Blood pressure cuffs used for HBPM should be compliant with sphygmomanometer standards set by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation.
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Most of the evidence supports ABPM as the best method for confirming a diagnosis of hypertension. More research is needed on the accuracy of HBPM versus ABPM and the best HBPM protocols for follow-up of elevated office blood pressure. The diagnostic accuracy of blood pressure measurements taken by a visiting nurse or another health care worker in the home setting also merits more research. Self-use blood pressure measurement kiosks in community settings, such as pharmacies and grocery stores, may be frequently used by the public but are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. More research on the accuracy of kiosk measurements is needed. New technology has been developed that uses a wireless brachial blood pressure monitor that connects to a smartphone, a desktop computer, or the Internet for recording and analysis. More research is needed on the accuracy of these monitors, their use in primary prevention, and their association with long-term health outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/high-blood-pressure-in-adults-screening#clinical-considerations,152,The Eighth Joint National Committee does not address the diagnosis of hypertension in its 2014 guidelines.&nbsp,The Seventh Joint National Committee recommends screening for high blood pressure at least once every 2 years in adults with blood pressure less than 120/80 mm Hg and every year in adults with blood pressure of 120 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg.&nbsp,The American Heart Association recommends blood pressure measurement at each regular health care visit or at least once every 2 years in adults with blood pressure less than 120/80 mm Hg.&nbsp,The American Academy of Family Physicians&rsquo, recommendation is similar to that of the USPSTF.The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends blood pressure screening as part of women&rsquo
"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies only to asymptomatic children whose parents or clinicians do not have specific concerns about their speech, language, hearing, or development. It does not apply to children whose parents or clinicians raise those concerns; these children should undergo evaluation and, if needed, treatment.<br /><br />This recommendation discusses the identification and treatment of &ldquo;primary&rdquo; speech and language delays and disorders (i.e., in children who have not been previously identified with another disorder or disability that may cause speech or language impairment].
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
Information about the prevalence of speech and language delays and disorders in young children in the United States is limited. In 2007, about 2.6% of children ages 3 to 5 years received services for speech and language disabilities under IDEA. <br /><br />Childhood speech and language disorders include a broad set of disorders with heterogeneous outcomes. Information about the natural history of these disorders is limited, because most affected children receive at least some type of intervention. However, there is some evidence that young children with speech and language delay may be at increased risk of language-based learning disabilities.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
The potential harms of screening and interventions for speech and language disorders in young children in primary care include the time, effort, and anxiety associated with further testing after a positive screen, as well as the potential detriments associated with diagnostic labeling. However, the USPSTF found no studies on these harms.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
Surveillance or screening for speech and language disorders is commonly recommended as part of routine developmental surveillance and screening in primary care settings (i.e., during well-child visits).&nbsp;In practice, however, such screening is not universal. The previous evidence review&nbsp;found that 55% of parents reported that their toddler did not receive any type of developmental assessment at their well-child visit, and 30% of parents reported that their child&rsquo;s health care provider had not discussed with them how their child communicates.&nbsp;In a 2009 study, approximately half of responding pediatricians reported that they &ldquo;always or almost always&rdquo; use a standardized screening tool to detect developmental problems in young children; about 40% of respondents reported using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ).&nbsp;The USPSTF distinguishes between screening in primary care settings and diagnostic testing, which may occur in other settings.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
Based on a review of 31 cohort studies, several risk factors have been reported to be associated with speech and language delay and disorders, including male sex, family history of speech and language impairment, low parental education level, and perinatal risk factors (e.g., prematurity, low birth weight, and birth difficulties).
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on specific screening tests for use in primary care. Widely used screening tests in the United States include the ASQ, the Language Development Survey (LDS), and the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CD).<br />
<h3>Interventions</h3>
Interventions for childhood speech and language disorders vary widely and can include speech-language therapy sessions and assistive technology (if indicated). Interventions are commonly individualized to each child&rsquo;s specific pattern of symptoms, needs, interests, personality, and learning style. Treatment plans also incorporate the priorities of the child, parents, and/or teachers. Speech-language therapy may take place in various settings, such as speech and language specialty clinics, the school or classroom, and the home. Therapy may be administered on an individual basis and/or in groups, and may be child-centered and/or include peer and family components. Therapists may be speech-language pathologists, educators, or parents. The duration and intensity of the intervention depend on the severity of the speech or language disorder and the child&rsquo;s progress in meeting therapy goals.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
The USPSTF recommends screening for hearing loss in all newborn infants (B recommendation). The USPSTF is developing a recommendation on screening for autism spectrum disorder in young children. These recommendations are available on the USPSTF Web site (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
All states have designated programs that offer evaluation and intervention services to children ages 0 to 5 years. IDEA is a law that ensures early intervention, special education, and related services for children with disabilities in the United States. Infants and toddlers (birth to age 2 years) with disabilities and their families may receive early intervention services under IDEA part C, whereas children and adolescents (ages 3 to 21 years) may receive special education and related services under IDEA part B.
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
The USPSTF identified several evidence gaps, including a critical need for studies specifically designed and executed to address whether systematic, routine screening for speech and language delay and disorders in young children in primary care settings leads to improved speech, language, or other outcomes. Studies on the feasibility of speech- and language-specific screening as part of routine developmental screening and that identify the most effective screening instruments are needed. Studies on the potential harms of screening and interventions are also needed. <br /><br />Information about the prevalence of speech and language delays and disorders in young children in the United States is lacking. More information about the specific factors associated with intervention effectiveness, including the potential effects of age at diagnosis, age at treatment, treatment type, and treatment duration, is needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/speech-and-language-delay-and-disorders-in-children-age-5-and-younger-screening#Pod5,155,"The American Academy of Pediatrics&nbsp;recommends that developmental surveillance be incorporated at every well-child preventive care visit for children from birth through age 3 years. It also recommends that any concerns raised during surveillance should be promptly addressed with standardized developmental screening tests. In addition, it recommends that screening tests should be administered regularly at well-child visits at the ages of 9, 18, and 24 or 30 months.","Burden of Disease
According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, speech sound disorders affect 10% of children. The estimated prevalence of language difficulty in preschool-aged children is between 2% and 19%. Specific language impairment is one of the most common childhood disorders, affecting 7% of children. More than 2 million Americans stutter, half of whom are children.11
Childhood speech and language disorders include a broad set of disorders with heterogeneous outcomes. Young children with speech and language delay may be at increased risk of learning disabilities once they reach school age.4 Children with speech sound disorders or language impairment are at greatest risk of being diagnosed with a literacy disability,12 including difficulty with reading in grade school13-16 and/or with written language.17
The risk of poor outcomes is greater for children whose disorders persist past the early childhood years and for those who have lower IQ scores and language impairments rather than only speech impairments.18 Children who are diagnosed with language delays may have more problems with behavior and psychosocial adjustment, which may persist into adulthood.19, 20
Scope of Review
To update its 2006 recommendation statement, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review on screening for speech and language delay and disorders in children aged 5 years or younger. The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the accuracy of screening in primary care settings, as well as the role of surveillance (active monitoring) by primary care clinicians to identify children for further diagnostic evaluation and interventions for speech and language delays and disorders. The USPSTF also evaluated evidence on whether screening and interventions for speech and language delay and disorders lead to improved speech, language, or other outcomes, as well as the potential harms associated with screening and interventions.
The evidence review focused on speech and language delays and disorders with a “primary” or developmental etiology. That is, the review was limited to studies in children who had not been previously identified with another disorder or disability that may cause speech or language impairment. The review excluded studies that focused on acquired, focal causes of speech and language delay. Although abnormal speech and language development may be associated with autism spectrum disorder, this review did not evaluate screening for autism spectrum disorder. The USPSTF is currently reviewing the evidence on screening for autism spectrum disorder for a separate recommendation statement.
The evidence review focused on studies conducted in children aged 5 years or younger in which any child who screened positive received formal diagnostic assessment for speech and language delays and disorders by 6 years of age. Studies of treatment and/or intervention outcomes were not restricted by age at treatment but focused primarily on toddlers and preschool-aged children.
The evidence review included randomized, controlled trials and other systematic reviews, as well as cohort studies of screening and surveillance for speech and language delays and disorders. The USPSTF focused on screening instruments specific to speech and language conditions, as well as more general developmental screening tools with speech and language components. All tools needed to be feasible for use in primary care or the results had to be interpretable within a primary care setting. For surveillance studies, the USPSTF considered processes of monitoring speech and language in primary care settings rather than formal screening instruments. Screening and surveillance studies had to be conducted or results had to be interpretable in primary care settings. In contrast, treatment studies were not limited by study setting, which included speech and language clinics, schools, and/or home settings.
The current review differed somewhat from the previous review in that it focused on screening tools that can be administered within the usual length of a primary care visit (≤10 minutes) or those that require more than 10 minutes and are administered outside of a primary care setting, if the results can be readily interpreted by a primary care clinician. The current review also focused on studies in patients without known causes of speech and language delay (because these are the patients most likely to be identified through screening]]
Accuracy of Screening Tests
The USPSTF identified 24 studies (5 good- and 19 fair-quality)9 that evaluated the accuracy of 20 different screening tools. The majority of studies included 2- and 3-year-olds, but the ages varied. Recruitment techniques and venues included advertisements, birth registries, early childhood programs, university research programs, medical practices, and school registration and entrance medical examinations.
The USPSTF considered 7 parent-administered screening tools: the ASQ, the General Language Screen (formerly known as the Parent Language Checklist), the Infant-Toddler Checklist, the LDS, the CDI, the Speech and Language Parent Questionnaire, and the Ward Infant Language Screening Test, Assessment, Acceleration, and Remediation. The USPSTF considered 13 screening tools administered by professionals or paraprofessionals: the Battelle Developmental Inventory, the BRIGANCE Preschool Screen, the Davis Observation Checklist for Texas, the Denver Articulation Screening Exam, DENVER II (formerly the Denver Developmental Screening Test), a standard developmental screen administered by nurses, Early Screening Profiles, the Fluharty Preschool Speech and Language Screening Test, the Northwestern Syntax Screening Test, the Screening Kit of Language Development, the Sentence Repetition Screening Test, the Structured Screening Test (formerly known as the Hackney Early Language Screening Test), and Rigby’s trial speech screening test.
Test performance characteristics varied widely. Parent-administered screening tools generally performed better than other tools. Among parent-administered tools, sensitivity was generally higher for the CDI, the Infant-Toddler Checklist, and the LDS. Specificity was comparable across the CDI, the LDS, and the ASQ.
The applicability of the evidence to screening in primary care is limited by several factors. Most studies focused on prescreened populations with a relatively high prevalence of language delays and disabilities (usually >10%). The USPSTF found it difficult to compare the performance of individual screening tools across populations because individual studies used different tools and outcome measures in different populations and settings. Included studies used well-regarded instruments used by speech-language pathologists as reference standards; however, individual studies used different reference standards. In addition to small sample sizes, some studies were conducted in countries with health care systems that are not comparable with that of the United States.
The USPSTF identified no studies on the accuracy of surveillance of speech and language development by primary care clinicians.
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Interventions
The review for the USPSTF identified 1 poor-quality randomized, controlled trial of screening for language delays in children ages 18 and 24 months that followed outcomes at ages 3 and 8 years.21 This cluster-randomized trial and follow-up study was conducted in 9,419 children at 55 child health centers in 6 geographic regions of The Netherlands. Outcomes included the percentage of children who attended a special school, percentage who repeated a class because of language problems, and percentage who scored low on standardized language tests. The authors concluded that screening toddlers for language delay reduces requirements for special education and leads to improved language performance at age 8 years. However, the study was rated as poor quality, and therefore not included in the USPSTF’s deliberation, because of several limitations, including the following: suboptimal rates of screening and low retention of trial subjects, reliance on indirect measures of speech and language outcomes in school-aged children (instead of individualized testing), lack of blinding to screening or treatment status by teachers and parents who assessed outcomes, and lack of adjustment for other potential reasons for placement in special education.
The USPSTF identified 13 fair- or good-quality studies on the potential benefits of treatment interventions for children diagnosed with specific speech and language delays and disorders that reported inconsistent findings on speech and language outcomes.9 The majority of the trials reported improvements in speech and language measures. However, the applicability of this evidence to routine screening in a primary care setting is limited, because many of the studies were conducted in very high risk populations (i.e., high-prevalence populations]] In addition, these studies did not report treatment effectiveness in children whose speech and language delay had actually been detected by screening; instead, the delays had often been identified as a result of parent or teacher concerns. A majority of the intervention studies were conducted outside of the United States, which could also limit the applicability of findings.
The USPSTF identified 4 fair- or good-quality studies that reported inconsistent findings on other outcomes, including socialization, reading comprehension, parental stress, and child well-being or attention level.
Potential Harms of Screening and Interventions
The USPSTF identified no studies on the potential harms of screening in primary care settings for speech and language delays and disorders, such as labeling or anxiety. The USPSTF identified 2 studies (1 fair- and 1 good-quality) on the potential harms of treatment that reported inconsistent findings.9 The treatment group of 1 study reported reduced parental stress, whereas another study reported no effect on child well-being or attention level. Treatment harms were generally not measured or reported; the 2 included studies reported few data on a limited number of outcomes.
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the accuracy of screening or surveillance for speech and language delay and disorders in primary care settings. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the potential benefits of screening in primary care settings and treatment on speech, language, or other outcomes. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that treatment is associated with improvements in some speech and language measures, but inadequate evidence on its effectiveness in screen-detected children. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the association between treatment and outcomes other than speech and language. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the potential harms of screening in primary care settings and treatment for speech and language delay and disorders. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening in primary care settings for speech and language delays and disorders in young children cannot be determined.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted on the USPSTF Web site from November 18 to December 15, 2014. In response to public comment, the USPSTF clarified that this recommendation applies only to asymptomatic children whose parents or clinicians do not have specific concerns about their speech, language, hearing, or development. The USPSTF also emphasized that this recommendation applies only to screening in primary care settings, and it noted the distinction between screening in primary care settings and diagnostic testing, which may occur in other settings. The USPSTF also noted that this recommendation does not evaluate screening for autism spectrum disorder, which the Task Force will address in a separate recommendation statement. The USPSTF also called for research on socioeconomic and other factors associated with risks, assessment, and management of speech and language delay and disorders in children.","<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Speech and language delays and disorders can pose significant problems for children and their families. Children with speech and language delays develop speech or language in the correct sequence but at a slower rate than expected, whereas children with speech and language disorders develop speech or language that is qualitatively different from typical development. Differentiating between delays and disorders can be complicated. First, screening instruments have difficulty distinguishing between the two. Second, although the majority of school-aged children with language disorders present with language delays as toddlers, some children outgrow their language delay. <br /><br />Information about the prevalence of speech and language delays and disorders in young children in the United States is limited. In 2007, about 2.6% of children ages 3 to 5 years received services for speech and language disabilities under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). In 1 population-based study in 8-year-olds in Utah, the prevalence of children with communication disorders (speech or language) on the basis of special education or&nbsp;<em>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</em>, classifications was 63.4 cases per 1,000 children.&nbsp;The prevalence of isolated communication disorders (i.e., children without a concomitant diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability) was 59.1 cases per 1,000 children.<br /><br />Information on the natural history of speech and language delays and disorders, including how outcomes may change as a result of screening or treatment, is also limited.</p>

"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults aged 18 years or older who are seen in primary care settings and are not known to have signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended. This recommendation focuses on screening (that is, testing for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults and treating those who are found to have a deficiency), which is different from other USPSTF recommendation statements on supplementation (that is, recommending preventive medication for patients at increased risk for a specific negative health outcome, such as falls, regardless of whether they have a deficiency).<br /><br />The USPSTF recognizes that there is no consensus on how to define vitamin D deficiency and does not endorse the use of a specific threshold to identify it. The evidence reviewed by the USPSTF used varying cut points. For the purposes of this recommendation statement, the term &ldquo;vitamin D deficiency&rdquo; is used to reflect evidence from study populations generally representing total serum 25-(OH)D levels of 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) or less or subpopulations of studies with levels less than 50 nmol/L (&lt;20 ng/mL).
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
Given the lack of consensus on how to define and assess vitamin D deficiency, its precise prevalence estimates are difficult to determine. To collect precise estimates, accurate assay methods, an internationally recognized reference standard, and a specific cut point for defining vitamin D deficiency need to be established. Reported estimates of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency vary widely depending on the period, cut point, study population, study design, and testing method. Estimates range from as low as 19% using a statistical modeling approach&nbsp;to as high as 77% based on NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) data from 2001 to 2004 (using a cut point of &lt;75 nmol/L [&lt;30 ng/mL]).<br /><br />The effect of vitamin D levels on health outcomes is difficult to evaluate. Lower vitamin D levels have been reported to increase risk for fractures, falls, functional limitations, some types of cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and death. However, observations of these associations are inconsistent and may vary by the cut point used to define low vitamin D levels and by subpopulation (defined by race or institutionalization). For example, African Americans have paradoxically lower reported rates of fractures despite having increased prevalence of low vitamin D levels than white persons.<br /><br />If a threshold total serum 25-(OH)D level could be established to define vitamin D deficiency and if testing assays could be standardized, the goal of screening for vitamin D deficiency would be to identify and treat it before associated adverse clinical outcomes occur. However, current evidence is inadequate to determine whether screening for and treatment of asymptomatic low 25-(OH)D levels improve clinical outcomes in community-dwelling adults.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
Screening may misclassify persons with a vitamin D deficiency because of the uncertainty about the cut point for defining deficiency and the variability of available testing assays. Misclassification may result in overdiagnosis (which may lead to nondeficient persons receiving unnecessary treatment) or underdiagnosis (which may lead to deficient persons not receiving treatment).<br /><br />A rare but potential harm of treatment with oral vitamin D is toxicity, which may lead to hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, suppressed parathyroid hormone, and hypercalciuria. However, the 25-(OH)D level associated with toxicity (often defined as &gt;500 nmol/L [&gt;200 ng/mL])&nbsp;is well above the level considered to be sufficient. Treatment with vitamin D plus calcium may also be associated with increased risk for kidney stones; vitamin D alone does not seem to increase this risk. In general, treatment with oral vitamin D does not seem to be associated with serious harms. Treatment with increased sun exposure (specifically ultraviolet B [UVB] radiation) may increase risk for skin cancer. Because of this concern, increased sun exposure is generally not recommended as treatment of vitamin D deficiency.
<h4>Costs</h4>
Several vitamin D testing methods are available; the cost of screening varies.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
Testing rates for vitamin D levels seem to be increasing, despite the uncertainty about the definition of deficiency. Although estimates of screening rates in primary care settings are not available, a recent study evaluating data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey found that the annual rate of outpatient visits associated with a diagnosis code for vitamin D deficiency more than tripled between 2008 and 2010 (1177 visits per 100,000 population in 2010).&nbsp;In addition, according to a 2009 survey, total serum 25-(OH)D testing increased by at least 50% compared with the previous year in more than half of the clinical laboratories surveyed.<br /><br />
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
Although there is not enough evidence to support screening for vitamin D deficiency, some evidence suggests factors that may increase risk for vitamin D deficiency. Persons with low vitamin D intake, decreased vitamin D absorption, and little or no sun exposure (for example, due to the winter season, high latitude, or physical sun avoidance) may be at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency.&nbsp;Obesity and darker skin pigmentation may also be associated with low levels of total serum 25-(OH)D, but whether these factors reflect vitamin D deficiency or increase the risk for adverse clinical outcomes is unclear. Obesity may allow for greater sequestration of vitamin D into adipose tissue; however, this vitamin D may still be bioavailable.&nbsp;Increased skin pigmentation reduces the skin's ability to produce vitamin D in response to UVB exposure. Prevalence rates of low total serum 25-(OH)D are 2 to 9 times higher in African Americans and 2 to 3 times higher in Hispanics than in white persons,&nbsp;yet the risk for fractures in African Americans is half that in white persons.&nbsp;Other factors, such as body composition and calcium economy, have been proposed to explain this paradox;&nbsp;however, a recent study suggests that although total serum 25-(OH)D levels in African Americans may be low, the concentration of bioavailable 25-(OH)D may not be.&nbsp;Some evidence suggests that older age and female sex may also be associated with increased risk for vitamin D deficiency; however, these findings are inconsistent.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Current vitamin D assays measure total serum 25-(OH)D levels to determine vitamin D status (that is, whether a person is considered to have or not have a deficiency). Many testing methods are available, including competitive protein binding, immunoassay, high-performance liquid chromatography, and combined high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. However, the sensitivity and specificity of these tests are unknown because of the lack of studies that use an internationally recognized reference standard. Variability between assay methods and between laboratories using the same methods may range from 10% to 20%, and classification of samples as &ldquo;deficient&rdquo; or &ldquo;nondeficient&rdquo; may vary by 4% to 32%, depending on which assay is used.&nbsp;Another factor that may complicate interpretation is that 25-(OH)D may act as a negative acute-phase reactant and its levels may decrease in response to inflammation. Lastly, whether common laboratory reference ranges are appropriate for all ethnic groups is unclear.
<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>
Oral vitamin D is most often used to treat vitamin D deficiency; other treatment options include increasing dietary vitamin D intake or UVB exposure. Commonly available forms of oral vitamin D include vitamin D3&nbsp;(cholecalciferol) and vitamin D2&nbsp;(ergocalciferol).
<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>
According to the Institute of Medicine, daily dietary vitamin D intake of 600 IU in adults aged 18 to 70 years and 800 IU in adults older than 70 years should be sufficient to meet the needs of 97.5% of the adult population.&nbsp;Ultraviolet B exposure may also increase vitamin D levels; however, several variables (such as the time of day, season, cloud cover, skin pigmentation, and sunscreen use) can affect the length of exposure needed to attain sufficient vitamin D levels. Sun exposure to prevent vitamin D deficiency is not generally recommended because it increases the risk for skin cancer associated with UVB radiation.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The USPSTF has published recommendations on the use of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of falls and fractures and vitamin supplementation for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer (available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>). These recommendations differ from the current recommendation statement in that they address vitamin D supplementation in certain populations at high risk for falls, fractures, cardiovascular disease, or cancer without first determining a patient's vitamin D status.
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
The lack of an accurate screening strategy to identify vitamin D deficiency, especially in important subpopulations (such as African Americans), is a critical gap in the evidence. Further research is needed to determine the cut point that defines vitamin D deficiency, the sensitivity and specificity of various assays using an internationally accepted reference standard, and whether total serum 25-(OH)D is the best measure of vitamin D deficiency in all populations. The possible effects of acute inflammation on vitamin D levels also needs further investigation. More studies are also needed to evaluate which treatment regimens may benefit specific vitamin D&ndash;deficient populations, such as men and non-Caucasian ethnic groups, who are absent from the evidence base. Lastly, further studies are needed to evaluate the harms of screening for and treatment of vitamin D deficiency. One ongoing trial, VITAL (VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL), may provide some answers in the near future. This large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is designed to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease in a multiethnic study population. Furthermore, because a large portion of the study population will have baseline 25-(OH)D levels measured, the study may provide information on whether supplementation in vitamin D&ndash;deficient populations is beneficial.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vitamin-d-deficiency-screening#Pod5,154,"No national primary care professional organization currently recommends population-wide screening for vitamin D deficiency. The American Academy of Family Physicians concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency.&nbsp;The Endocrine Society recommends screening for vitamin D deficiency only in persons at risk and states that there is no evidence showing benefits of screening at a population level.&nbsp;It defines vitamin D deficiency as total serum 25-(OH)D levels of less than 50 nmol/L (&lt;20 ng/mL) and vitamin D insufficiency as 52.5 to 72.5 nmol/L (21 to 29 ng/mL) and recommends treatment of persons with a vitamin D deficiency. Other organizations, including the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,&nbsp;the American Geriatric Society,&nbsp;and the National Osteoporosis Foundation,&nbsp;recommend testing for vitamin D as part of osteoporosis management or falls prevention. The Institute of Medicine does not have formal guidelines on screening for vitamin D deficiency, but it has published a report on the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D.&nbsp;The RDA is the estimated requirement to meet or exceed the vitamin D needs of 97.5% of the adult population. Assuming minimal sun exposure, the Institute of Medicine&rsquo;s RDA for vitamin D is 600 IU/day for adults aged 19 to 70 years and 800 IU/day for adults older than 70 years. Furthermore, it concluded that total serum 25-(OH)D levels of 40 nmol/L (16 ng/mL) meet the needs of approximately half of the population, and levels of 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) or greater meet the needs of nearly all of the population. However, it is not necessary to evaluate 25-(OH)D levels before discussing RDA with patients.","Burden of Disease
Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that helps regulate calcium homeostasis and bone health. Important sources of vitamin D include diet (such as fatty fish, cod liver oil, dairy products, fortified beverages and foods, and supplements) and endogenous synthesis triggered by UVB exposure. Inadequate dietary vitamin D intake, decreased vitamin D absorption, and limited UVB exposure can all decrease vitamin D levels, but the exact threshold that defines vitamin D deficiency is not well-established. Furthermore, the association between vitamin D status and health outcomes is unclear.
Severe and prolonged vitamin D deficiency can cause bone mineralization diseases, such as rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Other health effects caused by more moderate decreases in vitamin D levels, which were the focus of the current evidence review, are difficult to determine. Studies have evaluated the association between vitamin D status and health outcomes, such as fractures, falls, cancer, cardiovascular disease, death, functional limitations, diabetes, and depression. Results have varied depending on the cut point used to define deficiency, population, and setting.1, 2 Overall, studies have suggested a decreased risk for colorectal cancer with higher 25-(OH)D levels and either an inverse or a U-shaped relationship with mortality. Studies on risk for fractures, falls, and cardiovascular disease have been less consistent; most often, white populations showed an increased risk for fractures and cardiovascular disease, and institutionalized populations showed an increased risk for falls. Few studies have evaluated associations with functional limitations, diabetes, or depression, but these studies have generally suggested an increased risk with lower 25-(OH)D levels.1, 2
Childhood rickets has become relatively rare in the United States since vitamin D–fortified milk was introduced in the 1930s. Prevalence rates of less clinically overt vitamin D deficiency are much more difficult to characterize given the uncertainty about how to define adequate levels of vitamin D and which cut point defines deficiency. In addition, the lack of a reference standard for vitamin D testing until recently has further complicated accurate measurement of vitamin D deficiency prevalence rates.
A recent study using a statistical probability approach estimated that 19% of the U.S. population is at risk for vitamin D inadequacy.4 On the basis of NHANES data, 33% of the U.S. population had 25-(OH)D levels at 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) or less from 2001 to 200613 and 77% had levels less than 75 nmol/L (<30 ng/mL) from 2001 to 2004.5
Commonly reported risk factors for low 25-(OH)D levels are decreased dietary vitamin D intake, absorption, or synthesis due to decreased sun exposure or darker skin pigmentation; older age; inflammatory bowel disease, malabsorptive conditions, or history of gastric bypass; being homebound or institutionalized; routinely wearing clothing that prevents sun exposure on most of the skin; and living at high latitudes.14
Populations with darker skin pigmentation, such as African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians, have been found to have lower 25-(OH)D levels than white populations. According to the Second National Report on Biochemical Indicators of Diet and Nutrition in the U.S. Population (based on NHANES data from 2003 to 2006), 21.7% of white persons had 25-(OH)D levels of 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) or less compared with 70.6% of African Americans and 44.2% of Hispanics; further, the geometric mean of 25-(OH)D levels in adults aged 20 years or older ranged from 57.5 to 64 nmol/L (23.0 to 25.6 ng/mL) in white persons, 32.5 to 36.25 nmol/L (13.0 to 14.5 ng/mL) in African Americans, and 44.5 to 46.5 nmol/L (17.8 to 18.6 ng/mL) in Hispanics. However, it is unclear if low 25-(OH)D levels are associated with adverse clinical outcomes in these populations. For example, the increased risk for fractures and cardiovascular disease observed in some studies of white persons has not been found in African Americans.1 A recent study suggests that although total serum 25-(OH)D levels may be lower in African Americans than in white persons, the concentration of bioavailable 25-(OH)D may be similar between the 2 populations when vitamin D–binding protein is considered.11 If substantiated, this finding could potentially explain why higher rates of low total serum 25-(OH)D levels have been reported in African Americans without an associated risk for fractures and question the use of total serum 25-(OH)D measurements to identify vitamin D deficiency in all populations.
Populations with obesity have been found to have lower 25-(OH)D levels; however, this may be due to either increased vitamin D requirements or greater sequestration of vitamin D into adipose tissue. It is not clear whether low 25-(OH)D levels in persons who are obese are associated with negative clinical outcomes.1, 12, 14
Scope of Review
This is a new topic for the USPSTF. The USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on screening for vitamin D deficiency, including the benefits and harms of screening and early treatment. The review focused on community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults aged 18 years or older who do not have clinical signs of vitamin D deficiency or conditions that could cause vitamin D deficiency and were seen in primary care settings. Populations with certain conditions, such as (but not limited to) bone, endocrine, or autoimmune diseases were excluded because vitamin D testing in these populations could be considered management of a condition rather than general screening. Similarly, because of the unique and increased nutritional demands during pregnancy, vitamin D testing in pregnant women is considered outside the scope of general screening. Although breastfeeding women were not excluded, the review identified no studies of breastfeeding women that met inclusion criteria. For treatment, the review included only oral vitamin D formulations; treatment with nonoral vitamin D therapies or UVB exposure was excluded.
Accuracy of Screening Tests
Despite the availability of many tests that measure total serum 25-(OH)D levels, their sensitivities and specificities are currently unknown given the lack of studies that use an internationally recognized, commutable reference standard. In addition, determining the accuracy of 25-(OH)D assays is complicated by an unclear understanding of how consistently (within a given assay and between assays) 25-(OH)D is displaced from vitamin D–binding protein to be measured and the effect of possible interference from other heterophilic antibodies that may bind and cause inaccurate measurements.15 Studies report testing variability between methods and between laboratories using the same method and that classification of patient samples as deficient or nondeficient can vary by 4% to 32%, depending on which assay is used.1, 2
Recognizing the need for standardization of vitamin D measurement, a few organizations recently initiated programs to improve testing accuracy. The National Institute of Standards and Technology developed a standard reference material for 25-(OH)D in 2009 that seems to improve testing accuracy of high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, but it has limited effects on improving accuracy of immunoassay methods. Since 2010, the Vitamin D Standardization Program16 has sought to standardize the laboratory measurement of vitamin D status through international collaboration and coordination and has developed standardized procedures for measuring total serum 25-(OH)D for the NHANES. However, these protocols are not yet available for commercial or research laboratory use. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers the Vitamin D Standardization Certification Program, which is a nonregulatory program that helps laboratories maintain and enhance the quality and comparability of measurement results.17 Several external accuracy-based testing systems are available for commercial and research laboratory use, such as the Vitamin D Metabolites Quality Assurance Program (established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Institutes of Health) and the Vitamin D External Quality Assurance Scheme.1
In addition to the uncertain accuracy of total serum 25-(OH)D tests, it is unclear if total serum 25-(OH)D is the best indicator of vitamin D status or if bioavailable 25-(OH)D should be used instead. As noted previously, a 2013 study found that although African American study participants had lower total serum 25-(OH)D levels than white study participants, both groups had similar concentrations of bioavailable 25-(OH)D. This study highlights the difficulty of using a universal total serum 25-(OH)D cut point to define deficiency across different races. However, more research is needed before this can be confirmed, and commercial testing of bioavailable 25-(OH)D levels is not currently available.
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment
Overall, the USPSTF reviewed 16 trials and 1 nested case–control study that evaluated the effects of treatment of vitamin D deficiency on health outcomes in populations not selected on the basis of signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency.1, 2 In general, studies included older adults (most studies had a mean study age >65 years) who were predominantly women (12 studies included women only) and community-dwelling, although 4 studies were conducted in exclusively institutionalized settings. All studies were done in the United States or Europe, with most conducted exclusively in Europe. Studies used vitamin D3 in doses of 400 to 4800 IU/day or 8400 to 50,000 IU/week, and 5 studies included treatment with calcium. Follow-up ranged from 2 months to 7 years.
No studies directly assessed the effectiveness of screening for vitamin D deficiency. The USPSTF identified 17 studies that assessed the effectiveness of oral vitamin D treatment on various health outcomes (such as death, falls, fractures, cancer, diabetes, and physical and psychosocial functioning) in participants with vitamin D deficiency who were not selected on the basis of signs or symptoms of deficiency.1, 2 Three studies conducted in Europe reported results suggesting a benefit on mortality in older institutionalized patients who were treated for vitamin D deficiency. However, meta-analysis of 8 studies limited to community-dwelling populations showed no benefit.1, 2 Studies on vitamin D treatment and falls reported mixed results. Five studies evaluated the effect of treatment of vitamin D deficiency on risk for fractures, and no studies, either individually or aggregated in meta-analysis, found a benefit on fracture risk.1, 2 Few studies evaluated the effect of treatment of vitamin D deficiency on risk for cancer or diabetes or physical or psychosocial functioning, but they generally reported no association.1, 2
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
No studies directly assessed the harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency. The USPSTF identified 24 studies1, 2 that reported on the adverse effects of vitamin D treatment; however, most trials were not designed to assess harms, and reporting of adverse events was generally suboptimal. Study participants were predominantly women, although 2 studies were done exclusively in men. The mean age of study participants ranged from 31 to 85 years, and most studies were conducted in Europe. Five studies were conducted exclusively in institutionalized settings. Vitamin D doses ranged from 400 to 7000 IU/day and 8400 to 54,000 IU/week, and 5 studies included treatment with vitamin D and calcium. Follow-up ranged from 6 weeks to 4 years.
No significant difference in rates of serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events was reported by any study, either individually or aggregated in meta-analysis.1, 2 Seventeen trials evaluated the risk for hypercalcemia with vitamin D treatment. No individual studies reported a significantly higher incidence of hypercalcemia; overall, 1.7% of treated participants versus 1.3% of control participants had hypercalcemia in trials that reported at least 1 case of hypercalcemia. However, the overall number of cases of hypercalcemia was low, and 7 trials reported no cases. Seven trials reported on risk for kidney stones, 2 of which included treatment with vitamin D and calcium; none reported kidney stones in any participants.
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
Overall, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence on screening for and early treatment of vitamin D deficiency in community-dwelling, U.S. primary care adult populations. No studies specifically evaluated the effect of screening on health outcomes or the treatment of screen-detected vitamin D deficiency. Studies on treatment of asymptomatic vitamin D deficiency used varying testing methods, cut points for vitamin D deficiency, and treatment regimens. Furthermore, most studies were conducted in elderly white (mostly European) and predominantly female populations; thus, applying the evidence to screening in the general U.S. primary care population is difficult. The harms of early treatment of vitamin D deficiency are small to none, and the evidence on the harms of screening is inadequate. Despite the absence of proven harms of screening, the USPSTF did not find sufficient evidence to determine that the benefits of screening outweigh the potential harms.
The USPSTF found evidence suggesting considerable variation in the way vitamin D is measured and great uncertainty about the specific vitamin D level that determines when treatment with vitamin D would improve health. Furthermore, information is lacking on how to measure and treat vitamin D deficiency in specific subpopulations, such as men, nonwhite ethnic groups, persons who are obese, and less elderly populations. On the basis of the current available science, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence on screening for vitamin D deficiency to improve health outcomes is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening and early intervention cannot be determined.
Response to Public Comments
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 24 June to 21 July 2014. Several comments requested that the scope of the recommendation be expanded to include special populations, such as those with bone, endocrine, and immune conditions. The USPSTF clarified the recommendation to better explain to which populations it applies and why other populations were not included. A few comments also requested information on risk assessment tools that could be used to stratify patients into high versus low risk for vitamin D deficiency before testing. The systematic review did not evaluate the evidence on risk assessment tools; however, the USPSTF may consider looking at this information in future updates of the topic. Comments also provided information on additional factors that complicate interpretation of vitamin D tests; the USPSTF added discussion of these factors to the Clinical Considerations and Discussion sections.","<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>No consensus exists on the definition of vitamin D deficiency or the optimal level of total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25-(OH)D] (the major form of vitamin D that circulates in the body). Depending on which cut point is used (usually &lt;50 or &lt;75 nmol/L [&lt;20 or &lt;30 ng/mL]), some studies have shown that low levels of vitamin D are associated with increased risk for fractures, functional limitations, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and death.</p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>Many testing methods are available that measure total serum 25-(OH)D levels. However, the accuracy of these tests to detect vitamin D deficiency is difficult to determine because of the lack of studies that use an internationally recognized reference standard and the lack of consensus on the laboratory values that define vitamin D deficiency. The USPSTF found evidence suggesting that results vary by testing method and between laboratories using the same testing methods.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found no studies that evaluated the direct benefit of screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that treatment of asymptomatic vitamin D deficiency has no benefit on cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, risk for death in community-dwelling adults, and risk for fractures in persons not selected on the basis of being at high risk for fractures. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefit of treatment of asymptomatic vitamin D deficiency on other outcomes, including psychosocial and physical functioning. Although the evidence is adequate for a few limited outcomes, the overall evidence on the early treatment of asymptomatic, screen-detected vitamin D deficiency in adults to improve overall health outcomes is inadequate.</p>
<h3>Harms of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found no studies that evaluated the direct harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of treatment of vitamin D deficiency are small to none. No studies reporting on the harms of treatment of vitamin D deficiency identified a significant increase in total adverse events, hypercalcemia, kidney stones, or gastrointestinal symptoms.</p>

"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to children ages 6 to 24 months living in the United States who are asymptomatic for iron deficiency anemia. It does not apply to children younger than age 6 months or older than 24 months, children who are severely malnourished, children who were born prematurely or with low birth weight, or children who have symptoms of iron deficiency anemia. Recommendations regarding screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women and iron supplementation during pregnancy are addressed in a separate recommendation statement (available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
Estimates of the prevalence of iron deficiency in children ages 1 to 3 years in the United States range from 8% to 14%, and approximately one third of these children also have anemia.&nbsp;Based on 1999 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, the estimated prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in children ages 12 to 35 months is 2.1%.&nbsp;Several factors have been identified that may increase a child&rsquo;s risk for iron deficiency anemia, including prematurity or low birth weight, use of non&ndash;iron-fortified formula or introduction to cow's milk in the first year of life, and exclusive breastfeeding without regular intake of iron-fortified food after age 6 months. Demographic factors associated with increased risk for iron deficiency anemia include low socioeconomic status and having parents who are migrant workers or recent immigrants. Additional factors that may be associated with increased risk for iron deficiency in children include weight and height in the 95th percentile or greater, bottle feeding beyond the first year of life, having a mother who is currently pregnant, or living in an urban area. Evidence on whether Hispanic ethnicity increases children's risk for iron deficiency has been mixed, with some studies showing an increased risk and others showing no increased risk. Older data from NHANES (1988&ndash;1994) showed that Mexican American children were nearly 3 times more likely than white children to have iron deficiency, whereas more recent NHANES data from 1999&ndash;2002 found no increased risk in Hispanic children.&nbsp;The USPSTF found no studies that assessed the performance of risk assessment tools to identify children who are at increased risk for iron deficiency anemia. <br /><br />Some observational studies suggest that iron deficiency anemia in early childhood may be associated with neurodevelopmental and behavioral delays and poorer performance on cognitive tests. However, concluding that there is a direct causal link between iron deficiency anemia and these outcomes is difficult because of the methodological flaws in these studies and potential confounding due to underlying nutritional and socioeconomic differences between groups.&nbsp;The aim of screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children is to identify and treat anemia before it leads to poor child health outcomes.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
The harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia have not been well studied. Potential harms of screening include false-positive results, anxiety, and cost. Reported adverse events of treatment with iron include limited gastrointestinal symptoms, darkening color of stool, staining of teeth and gums, and drug interactions with other medications. The previous USPSTF recommendation also noted that accidental iron overdose can occur in children receiving treatment or supplementation with iron.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
No recent nationally representative data on the current rate of screening are available.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Although the evidence is insufficient to recommend specific tests for screening, measurement of serum hemoglobin or hematocrit is often the first step.
<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>
In the United States, iron deficiency anemia in children is usually treated with oral iron. The usual dose in infants and young children is 3 to 6 mg/kg of elemental iron per day in 2 to 3 divided doses.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
According to the Institute of Medicine, the Recommended Dietary Allowance for iron in infants ages 7 to 12 months is 11 mg per day. In children ages 1 to 3 years, the Recommended Dietary Allowance is 7 mg per day. Natural food sources of iron include certain fruits, vegetables, meat, and poultry. The Institute of Medicine also notes that nonheme iron, which is found in vegetarian diets, may be less well absorbed than heme iron, which is found in diets containing meat; therefore, the iron requirement may be almost twice as much in children who eat a purely vegetarian diet.&nbsp;Fortified breads and grain products (such as cereal) are also good sources of iron for young children eating solid foods.&nbsp;Iron-fortified formula is another source of iron for infants. Federally regulated iron fortification of food products in the United States began in 1941, and the iron content in enriched grain products has increased over the years.&nbsp;More than 50% of the iron in the U.S. food supply comes from iron-fortified cereal grain products.

The USPSTF has published a separate recommendation statement on screening for iron deficiency anemia and iron supplementation in pregnant women (available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Although iron deficiency anemia has been associated with neurodevelopmental and cognitive impairments and behavioral delays based on observational data, studies that show an improvement in these health outcomes through treatment are lacking. Studies that evaluate the effects (short- and long-term) of change in iron status on health outcomes in settings similar to the United States with respect to nutrition, hemoparasite burden, and socioeconomic status are needed. Similarly, well-designed long-term, controlled studies that evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for and early treatment of asymptomatic iron deficiency anemia on health outcomes (diagnosis of neurodevelopmental, cognitive, or behavioral disease rather than hematologic indexes) are needed.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/iron-deficiency-anemia-in-young-children-screening#Pod5,157,"The Centers&nbsp; for Disease Control and Prevention recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia at ages 9 to 12 months, 6 months later, and then annually from ages 2 to 5 years in infants and preschool-age children who are at high risk for iron deficiency anemia.The Institute of Medicine recommends screening at age 9 months in full-term infants who are breastfed or not receiving iron-fortified formula. It recommends screening by&nbsp; age 3 months in preterm infants who are not receiving iron-fortified formula. Only infants who are found to have anemia at one of these earlier screenings should be rescreened routinely at ages 15 to 18 months.&nbsp;The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends universal screening for anemia at age 12 months and selective screening at any age in children who are at increased risk for iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia.&nbsp;Consistent with the USPSTF, the American Academy of Family Physicians concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess&nbsp; the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia in&nbsp; children ages 6 to 24 months.","Burden of Disease
Iron is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, an essential protein found in red blood cells. Iron deficiency occurs when body stores of iron become depleted. Iron deficiency can occur when there is an increased need for iron (e.g., during rapid growth in infants and toddlers) or when there is decreased iron intake and absorption (e.g., lack of iron sources in the diet). Iron deficiency anemia results when iron stores become so low that hemoglobin synthesis is impaired.
Iron deficiency is the most common nutrient deficiency worldwide7 and in the United  States.8, 9 It represents approximately 40% of cases of anemia in the United States.1 The estimated overall prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in the United States is 1% to 2% in children ages 1 to 5 years3 and 2.1% in children ages 12 to 35 months.1 Depending on the type of study used to estimate rates, the prevalence of iron deficiency in children ages 1 to 3 years  in the United States ranges from 8% to 14%.3 
The major concern about iron deficiency anemia in infants and young children is  whether it causes neurodevelopmental or behavioral delays or cognitive impairment. Few well-designed long-term studies on the effects of iron deficiency anemia in infancy and childhood on these health outcomes are available. Based primarily on observational data, studies have found an association between iron deficiency (with or without anemia) in infancy and childhood and impaired neurodevelopment in older children. Cognitive and behavioral delays in children have also been found to be associated with iron deficiency anemia. However, these observational studies have limitations due to the types of  measures reported and confounding with nutritional and socioeconomic factors, making causation difficult to determine.3 
Scope of Review
The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review of the evidence to update its 2006 recommendation on screening for iron deficiency anemia. The current review assessed the evidence on young children ages 6 to 24 months. The USPSTF focused on reviewing the evidence on the association between change in iron status as a result of intervention and improvement in child health outcomes, as well as treatment of iron deficiency anemia with oral iron formulations. The USPSTF considered studies conducted in settings similar to the United States in rates of  malnutrition, hemoparasite burden, and general socioeconomic status. The focus of the current recommendation is on screening and prevention of iron deficiency anemia; however, findings on iron deficiency, as reported by individual studies,  also are provided for a better understanding of the potential burden in the U.S. population.
Accuracy of Screening Tests
Serum hemoglobin or hematocrit is the primary screening test for iron deficiency anemia. Hemoglobin is sensitive for  detecting iron deficiency anemia; however, it is not sensitive for detecting iron deficiency because mild deficiency states may not affect hemoglobin levels.3 Hemoglobin is also nonspecific, as approximately 60% of cases of anemia result from causes other than iron deficiency.1 The positive predictive value of low hemoglobin for iron deficiency in children age 12 months ranges from 10% to 40%.10 In infants, particularly before age 12 months, iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia often resolve spontaneously, reducing the positive predictive value of any screening test. The sensitivity and specificity of other single tests (e.g., serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and erythrocyte protoporphyrin) as primary screening tools for iron deficiency anemia have not been well studied.11 Serum ferritin, often  used to measure iron status, acts as an acute-phase reactant, so it should ideally be measured in the absence of infection or inflammation.3
 Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment
No studies directly evaluated the effectiveness of screening for iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic children  ages 6 to 24 months and reported on health outcomes. In addition, no new studies of oral iron treatment of iron deficiency anemia in this age group were found. The 2006 evidence review reported on older treatment trials that were  not included in this update because they were found to be of poor quality or were conducted in settings not applicable to the current U.S. population. In 2006, the USPSTF concluded that there was poor evidence (conflicting studies) of the effectiveness of interventions that demonstrate improved health outcomes, such as developmental status, in asymptomatic children. 
No studies applicable to the current U.S. population demonstrated an association between change in iron status as a result of intervention and improvement in child health outcomes. Indirect evidence from 2 studies of iron supplementation in iron-sufficient children found no difference in growth or developmental scale scores with changes in iron status.3 
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
The USPSTF found no new studies that reported on the harms of iron treatment in children ages 6 to 24 months. The 2006 review concluded that there was no evidence on the harms of treatment but noted that accidental iron overdose can occur in children receiving treatment or supplementation with iron. One older trial from 1991 that was not included in the previous review found no difference in overall or specific adverse events, including gastrointestinal  events.12 
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
Overall, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence on screening for iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic children ages 6 to 24 months. The USPSTF identified no studies that evaluated the benefits or harms of screening in this age group. Studies on the benefits and harms of treatment were generally older, conducted in settings not considered applicable to the current U.S. population, or of poor quality. The USPSTF did not find  sufficient evidence to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia and thus cannot make a recommendation in favor of or  against screening. 
Response to  Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from March 31 to April 27, 2015. A few comments requested more information on which populations are at increased risk for iron deficiency anemia and to which population the recommendation applies. Existing language  describing risk factors for iron deficiency anemia and the target population for this recommendation was inserted earlier in the statement to make this information clearer. Some comments also requested separate analyses of certain high-risk populations. Although the USPSTF sought this information, limitations in the  evidence prevented it from performing separate analyses. A few comments noted that there was ambiguity in how the terms “iron deficiency” and “iron deficiency anemia” were used. The recommendation was reviewed to ensure  consistent use of each term and language was added to better explain that the focus of the recommendation is on iron deficiency anemia. 
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
Although associations have been reported between iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia and poorer neurodevelopmental measures, such as lower scores on intelligence or cognitive functioning tests, as well as behavioral delays, trials showing that treatment improves these outcomes are lacking. One oft-cited study conducted in Costa Rica reported on long-term developmental outcomes and found that compared with children who had good iron status as infants, children with chronic iron deficiency at ages 12 to 23 months who received treatment and had their anemia resolve within 3  months still scored lower on reading, writing, arithmetic, and motor tests at ages 11 to 14 years, as well as tests of cognitive function at age 19 years.13, 14 This suggests that preventing iron  deficiency anemia may be preferable to treating it once it develops, or that perhaps other nutrients or factors may be mediating the association between iron deficiency anemia and cognitive function and may need to be addressed in addition to iron.",,Screening for Iron Deficiency in Young Children,"Iron Deficiency Anemia in Young Children, Screening, 2015"
"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation addresses screening and supplementation in pregnant women and adolescents living in the United States who do not have symptoms of iron deficiency anemia. It does not address pregnant women who are malnourished, have symptoms of iron deficiency anemia, or have special hematologic conditions or nutritional needs that may increase their need for iron. Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children is addressed in a separate recommendation statement (available at<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
Based on older data, estimates of the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women in the United States range from 2% to 27%, with higher rates in later trimesters and minority populations.&nbsp;Based on calculations of total body iron from 1999 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, the estimated prevalence of iron deficiency in pregnant women is 18.6%; of these, 16.2% also have anemia.&nbsp;However, given the physiologic hemodilution that normally occurs during the later stages of pregnancy, determining exact prevalence rates of anemia in pregnant women may be difficult.<br /><br />Several factors have been identified that may increase a pregnant woman&rsquo;s risk for iron deficiency anemia, including a diet lacking in iron-rich foods (for example, a vegetarian diet with inadequate sources of iron), gastrointestinal disease and/or medications that can decrease iron absorption (for example, antacids), and a short interval between pregnancies. Non-Hispanic black and Mexican American women have higher prevalence rates of iron deficiency than white women and women with parity of 2 or more. Evidence on additional risk factors, such as lower educational level and family income, has been less consistent. On the basis of a literature scan, the USPSTF found limited evidence on the use of risk prediction tools to identify pregnant women who are at increased risk for iron deficiency anemia.<br /><br />&nbsp;Many observational studies have explored the association between adverse maternal and infant health outcomes (such as postpartum hemorrhage, preterm birth, low birthweight, and perinatal death) and iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy, but findings have been inconclusive.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
The harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia have not been well-studied but are likely minor. Potential harms of screening include false-positive results, anxiety, and cost. Reported adverse events of iron supplementation or treatment with iron include limited gastrointestinal symptoms, darkening color of urine or stool, staining of teeth and gums, and drug interactions with other medications.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
Rates of screening for iron deficiency anemia and iron supplementation in pregnant women by clinicians are not well-documented. However, based on anecdotal evidence, it is probably common. In addition, there may be other reasons to screen for anemia in pregnant women, such as to prepare for cesarean delivery or anticipated blood loss during a complicated delivery. Older data from 1988 show that 97% of pregnant women who received prenatal care reported being advised to take a multivitamin&ndash;mineral supplement.&nbsp;Based on 1996 to 2006 NHANES data, 77% of pregnant women reported using a supplement within the previous 30 days and they most frequently used a multivitamin containing 48 mg of iron.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Measurement of serum hemoglobin or hematocrit levels is often the first step used in primary care practice.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women is similar to that in nonpregnant women and includes additional iron intake through oral iron pills, prenatal vitamins, and diet. The usual dose is 60 to 120 mg of elemental iron per day.&nbsp;Intravenous iron treatment is also used during pregnancy.
<h3>Supplementation</h3>
Prenatal vitamins often include a low dose of iron; the usual dose prescribed in early pregnancy is 30 mg of elemental iron per day. Higher doses (60 to 100 mg of elemental iron per day) are sometimes prescribed in populations at increased risk for iron deficiency anemia.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
<h4>Dietary Iron</h4>
According to the Institute of Medicine, the Recommended Dietary Allowance for iron in pregnant women is 27 mg per day. Natural food sources of iron include certain fruits, vegetables, meat, and poultry. The Institute of Medicine also notes that nonheme iron, which is found in vegetarian diets, may be less well-absorbed than heme iron, which is found in diets containing meat; therefore, the iron requirement may be almost twice as much in women who eat a purely vegetarian diet.<br /><br />Fortified breads and grain products (such as cereal) are also important potential sources of iron.&nbsp;Federally regulated iron fortification of U.S. food products began in 1941, and the iron content in enriched grain products has increased over the years.&nbsp;It is estimated that more than 50% of the iron in the U.S. food supply comes from iron-fortified cereal grain products.

<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Studies that directly evaluate the effects of screening for and early treatment of iron deficiency anemia on maternal and infant health outcomes are needed. Although adequate evidence shows that iron supplementation improves maternal hematologic indexes, the clinical significance of this improvement needs to be defined. Well-designed and adequately powered studies that evaluate the effects of iron supplementation, or change in maternal iron status as a result of intervention, on maternal and infant health outcomes (for example, postpartum hemorrhage, maternal illness, preterm delivery, low birthweight, and perinatal death) are needed, particularly in settings similar to the United States with respect to nutrition, hemoparasite burden, and socioeconomic status.
<h3>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h3>
This recommendation is consistent with the 2006 recommendation statement on iron supplementation during pregnancy. Both the 2006 and the current recommendation statements found insufficient evidence to determine the balance of the benefits and harms of iron supplementation during pregnancy. Although the 2006 statement recommended screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women, the current recommendation found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening. In its review of the evidence to update the 2006 recommendation, the USPSTF found no good- or fair-quality studies on the benefits or harms of screening that would be applicable to the current U.S. population of pregnant women. Since 2006, the USPSTF has updated its methodology to better identify evidence that would be most applicable to the current U.S. population. Therefore, the USPSTF determined that the currently available and applicable evidence on screening for and early treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women is insufficient.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/iron-deficiency-anemia-in-pregnant-women-screening-and-supplementation#Pod5,156,"In 1998, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended screening for anemia and initiating low-dose iron supplementation at the first prenatal care visit for all pregnant women.&nbsp;The Institute of Medicine recommends screening for anemia in each trimester of pregnancy.&nbsp;The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends screening all pregnant women for anemia and treating those with iron deficiency anemia with supplemental iron. It also states that whether iron supplementation in well-nourished pregnant women without anemia affects perinatal outcomes is unclear.&nbsp;Consistent with the USPSTF, the American Academy of Family Physicians concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women to prevent adverse maternal health and birth outcomes.","Iron is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, which is an essential protein found in erythrocytes. During pregnancy, iron is also needed for the development of the fetus and placenta and to expand maternal erythrocyte mass. Iron deficiency occurs when body stores of iron become depleted. It can develop as a result of an increased need for iron (for example, during pregnancy), decreased iron intake and absorption (for example, lack of iron sources in the diet), or a loss of iron (for example, bleeding). Iron deficiency anemia results when iron stores become so low that hemoglobin synthesis is impaired, which causes anemia.
Current data on the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women in the United States are lacking. Based on older data from a cohort of mostly racial or ethnic minorities, the estimated prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women ranges from as low as 1.8% during the first trimester to as high as 27.4% during the third trimester.9 Based on calculations of total body iron from 1999 to 2006 NHANES data, the estimated prevalence of iron deficiency in pregnant women is 18.6%, which ranges from 6.9% in the first trimester to 29.5% in the third trimester.1
The major concern about iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women is whether it has adverse effects on maternal health or infant outcomes. Older observational studies suggest an association between adverse outcomes in infants and anemia in the early stages of pregnancy but not during the third trimester.2 Although iron supplementation and treatment during pregnancy have been observed to improve hemoglobin levels and iron status, the clinical significance of this finding is not clear and the evidence on maternal and infant health outcomes is limited.10 Further, studies evaluating these outcomes are often conducted in countries whose nutritional status and hemoparasite burden vary significantly from those of the United States.
Scope of Review
The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to update its 2006 recommendation on screening for iron deficiency anemia. The USPSTF focused on reviewing the evidence on the association between change in iron status as a result of intervention (oral supplementation or treatment) in pregnant women and adolescents and improvement in maternal and infant health outcomes. The use of intravenous iron was not assessed. The USPSTF considered studies conducted in settings similar to the United States in rates of malnutrition, hemoparasite burden, and general socioeconomic status. The focus of the current recommendation is on screening and supplementation for the prevention of iron deficiency anemia; however, findings on iron deficiency are also described as reported by individual studies and to provide a better understanding of the potential burden in the U.S. population.
Accuracy of Screening Tests
The primary screening test for anemia is to measure serum hemoglobin or hematocrit levels. However, given the hemodilution and physiologic anemia that normally occurs during pregnancy, using hemoglobin or hematocrit measurement alone to determine iron deficiency status can be imprecise, and its sensitivity and specificity for detecting iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women are unknown. Serum ferritin, which is often used to measure iron status, may have limited use during pregnancy because its concentration often decreases in late pregnancy despite adequate iron stores in the bone marrow. Also, serum ferritin is an acute phase reactant, which means its levels increase during periods of inflammation.11
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment
Screening and Treatment
No good- or fair-quality studies directly evaluated the effectiveness of screening for iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic pregnant women or adolescents with regard to maternal or infant health outcomes. In addition, no new studies that would be applicable to the current U.S. population evaluated oral iron treatment of iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic pregnant women.
Supplementation
Twelve good- or fair-quality randomized, controlled trials evaluated the effects of iron supplementation on various maternal hematologic indexes, including hemoglobin level, serum ferritin level, anemia, iron deficiency, and iron deficiency anemia. Eight studies were conducted in the United States or Europe, 3 in Iran, and 1 in Hong Kong; sample sizes ranged from 45 to 1164 participants. Supplement doses ranged from 20 to 120 mg per day, and outcomes were measured at various time points, from the second trimester to the postpartum period.2 Overall, the evidence was most consistent on improvement in hemoglobin and ferritin levels. Of the 8 studies12-19 reporting maternal hemoglobin levels at term or delivery, 612, 13, 15, 17-19 reported a significantly higher mean hemoglobin level in the supplemented versus control groups (122 to 139 g/L vs. 115 to 128 g/L, respectively). Of the 7 studies13-19 reporting serum ferritin levels at term or delivery, 513, 15, 17-19 reported a significantly higher ferritin level in the supplemented versus control groups (12.0 to 30.0 µg/L vs. 6.2 to 24.9 µg/L, respectively). Although adequate evidence shows that supplementation increases hemoglobin and ferritin levels, the evidence is unclear on whether this increase leads to an improvement in maternal and fetal health outcomes. In most of these studies, the supplemented groups had higher mean hemoglobin levels than the nonsupplemented groups; however, both groups reported values within normal limits. Evidence on the effects of supplementation on maternal iron deficiency anemia and anemia was inconsistent.
Five trials12, 13, 15, 17, 20 evaluated the effects of iron supplementation during pregnancy on maternal health outcomes (for example, cesarean delivery and quality of life), and 11 trials12-18, 20-23 evaluated various infant birth outcomes (for example, preterm delivery, low birthweight, small for gestational age, and infant mortality). Studies were conducted in the United States, Australia, Hong Kong, Ireland, Iran, and Norway; sample sizes ranged from 45 to 1164 participants. Studies used varying doses of iron, ranging from 20 to 200 mg per day. Studies on cesarean delivery and maternal quality of life were sparse or reported inconsistent results. Studies on individual infant birth outcomes were sparse, were frequently underpowered, or reported inconsistent findings overall. Only 4 studies reported on infant mortality,12, 13, 17, 20 and none reported a significant difference with prenatal iron supplementation. However, given the relatively low frequency of this outcome, studies were likely underpowered to detect a change and none reported power calculations for this outcome. Evidence on the effects of supplementation on birthweight was mixed. Of the 8 studies14-18, 21-23 reporting this outcome, 315, 21, 22 found that women receiving iron supplementation during pregnancy gave birth to infants with a significantly higher mean birthweight (95 to 205 g more) than women not receiving iron supplementation; however, both groups reported values within normal limits.2 Of the 6 studies reporting on low birthweight,12, 13, 16, 17, 21, 22 only 121 found a significantly lower rate of low-birthweight infants; however, these studies may have been underpowered to detect a change.
Further, of 4 studies15, 20, 21, 22 reporting on small-for-gestational-age infants, 1 study22 reported no significant difference in rates between supplemented and nonsupplemented groups, 2 studies15, 21 reported fewer small-for-gestational-age infants in supplemented groups, and 1 study20 reported more small-for-gestational-age infants in the supplemented group. Overall, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the effectiveness of supplementation during pregnancy.
No good- or fair-quality studies that would be applicable to the current U.S. population2 evaluated the association between change in iron status as a result of intervention (supplementation or treatment) and improvement in maternal or infant health outcomes.
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
Screening and Treatment
No good- or fair-quality studies reported on the harms of screening or early treatment.2 Potential harms of iron treatment include gastrointestinal symptoms.
Supplementation
Ten trials12-17, 20-23 reported on the harms of routine iron supplementation during pregnancy. Studies were conducted in the United States, Ireland, Hong Kong, Norway, Iran, and Australia, and sample sizes ranged from 45 to 1164 participants. Supplementation doses ranged from 20 to 200 mg per day. Most reported harms, including nausea, constipation, and diarrhea, were transient and not serious. In general, no significant difference was found between supplemented and control groups. Reported rates of nausea ranged from 29% to 63% in supplemented groups and 28% to 65% in control groups. Reported rates of vomiting ranged from 12% to 41% in supplemented groups and 15% to 41% in control groups. Reported rates of constipation (or ≤3 bowel movements per week) ranged from 4% to 29% in supplemented groups and 1.6% to 28% in control groups. Evidence on supplementation and maternal hypertension was inconsistent, ranging from 1.4% to 7.5% in supplemented groups and 0% to 9% in control groups.2 Overall, the USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of supplementation are small to none.
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
Screening and Early Detection
Overall, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence on screening for iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic pregnant women and adolescents. No good- or fair-quality studies were found that evaluated the benefits or harms of screening in this population. There was 1 older poor-quality study on the benefits and harms of treatment, but it was not applicable to the current U.S. population of pregnant women. Given the lack of studies on screening, the USPSTF did not find sufficient evidence to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia and thus cannot make a recommendation in favor of or against screening.
Supplementation
Overall, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence on the effects of iron supplementation during pregnancy. Although the USPSTF found adequate evidence on harms and deemed them to be small to none, it found inadequate evidence on benefits. Reported benefits of supplementation were limited to intermediate outcomes (maternal hematologic indexes), and evidence on the benefits of supplementation on maternal and infant health outcomes was inadequate because of inconsistent results and underpowered studies. Given the inconsistent findings and lack of adequately powered studies on the effect of supplementation on maternal and infant health outcomes, the USPSTF did not find sufficient evidence to determine the balance of benefits and harms of supplementation and thus cannot make a recommendation in favor of or against iron supplementation.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 31 March to 27 April 2015. A few comments requested more information on which populations are at increased risk for iron deficiency anemia and to which population the recommendation applies. Existing language describing risk factors for iron deficiency anemia and the target population for this recommendation was inserted earlier in the statement to make this information clearer. Some comments also requested separate analyses of certain high-risk populations. Although the USPSTF sought this information, limitations in the evidence prevented it from performing separate analyses. A few comments noted ambiguity in how the terms “iron deficiency” and “iron deficiency anemia” were used. The recommendation was reviewed to ensure consistent use of each term, and language was added to better explain that the focus of the recommendation is on iron deficiency anemia. The USPSTF also clarified that intravenous iron treatment is a potential therapy that is offered in current practice; however, it was not a focus of the current review.
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
Based on older observational data, the association between negative iron status during pregnancy and adverse maternal and infant health outcomes is inconsistent. Some findings indicate that anemia occurring earlier in pregnancy may be associated with serious adverse infant outcomes, but anemia occurring during the third trimester may not. Evidence on the association between improvement in maternal iron status and improvement in maternal and infant health outcomes is lacking. Although treatment and supplementation with oral iron can improve maternal hematologic indexes (most often, hemoglobin and serum ferritin levels), subsequent improvement in maternal and infant outcomes has not been well-demonstrated. This raises questions on whether the timing of identification and correction of iron deficiency anemia plays an important role and whether current measures of iron deficiency anemia (primarily hemoglobin, hematocrit, and ferritin levels) are effective in identifying women who may need additional iron during pregnancy, given the normal occurrence of physiologic anemia and the limitations of interpreting ferritin levels","<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>The aims of iron supplementation or screening for and treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women are to improve maternal and infant health outcomes. Few data are available to estimate the current prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women in the United States. Based on older data from 1999 to 2006, an estimated 18.6% of pregnant women have iron deficiency; of those, an estimated 16.2% have anemia.&nbsp;Rates may be higher in low-income and minority populations.</p>
<h3>Detection and Recognition of Risk Status</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that specifically addressed the accuracy of screening tests in asymptomatic pregnant women. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to evaluate risk prediction tools to identify pregnant women who are at increased risk for iron deficiency anemia.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>
<h4>Screening</h4>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on screening for iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic pregnant women. No studies evaluated the direct effects of routine screening in asymptomatic pregnant women on maternal health or birth outcomes. The USPSTF also found inadequate evidence on the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women because none of the recent studies on treatment were generalizable to the general U.S. population. This represents a critical gap in the evidence.</p>
<h4>Preventive Medication</h4>
<p>Overall, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the effect of routine iron supplementation during pregnancy on maternal health or birth outcomes, such as maternal iron deficiency anemia, cesarean delivery, preterm delivery, infant mortality, or low birthweight. Several studies reported inconsistent findings on these health outcomes. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that routine iron supplementation during pregnancy improves intermediate maternal hematologic indexes, such as serum ferritin and hemoglobin levels. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that routine iron supplementation during pregnancy has no effects on the length of gestation and infant Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes.</p>
<h4>Change in Iron Status</h4>
<p>No studies were found that directly assessed the association between change in iron status as a result of treatment or supplementation and improvement in maternal or infant health outcomes. This represents a critical gap in the evidence.</p>

The benefit is smaller in younger women: screening 10,000 women aged 50 to 59 years will result in 8 (CI, 2 to 17) fewer breast cancer deaths, and screening 10,000 women aged 40 to 49 years will result in 3 (CI, 0 to 9) fewer breast cancer deaths.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2"">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation3"">3</a>&nbsp;Most of these trials began enrollment more than 30 years ago, and these estimates may not reflect the current likelihood of avoiding a breast cancer death with contemporary screening mammography technology. Mammography imaging has since improved, which may result in more tumors being detected at a curable stage today than at the time of these trials. However, breast cancer treatments have also improved, and as treatment improves, the advantage of earlier detection decreases, so that some of the women who died of breast cancer in the nonscreened groups in these trials would survive today.
<h3>Harms of Screening</h3>
The most important harm of screening is the detection and treatment of invasive and noninvasive cancer that would never have been detected, or threaten health, in the absence of screening (overdiagnosis and overtreatment). Existing science does not allow for the ability to determine precisely what proportion of cancer diagnosed by mammography today reflects overdiagnosis, and estimates vary widely depending on the data source and method of calculation used.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2"">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation4"">4</a>&nbsp;In the United States, the rate of diagnosis of invasive plus noninvasive breast cancer increased by 50% during the era of mammography screening (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#fig"">Figure</a>).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation5"">5</a>&nbsp;It is not possible to know with certainty what proportion of that increase is due to overdiagnosis and what proportion reflects other reasons for a rising incidence. If overdiagnosis is the only explanation for the increase, 1 in 3 women diagnosed with breast cancer today is being treated for cancer that would never have been discovered or caused her health problems in the absence of screening. The best estimates from randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of mammography screening on breast cancer mortality suggest that 1 in 5 women diagnosed with breast cancer over approximately 10 years will be overdiagnosed.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation6"">6</a>&nbsp;Modeling studies conducted in support of this recommendation by the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) provide a range of estimates that reflect different underlying assumptions; the median estimate is that 1 in 8 women diagnosed with breast cancer with biennial screening from ages 50 to 74 years will be overdiagnosed. The rate increases with an earlier start age or with annual mammography.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation7"">7</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation8"">8</a>&nbsp;Even with the conservative estimate of 1 in 8 breast cancer cases being overdiagnosed, for every woman who avoids a death from breast cancer through screening, 2 to 3 women will be treated unnecessarily. <br /><br />The other principal harms of screening are false-positive results, which require further imaging and often breast biopsy, and false-negative results.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab2"">Table 2</a>&nbsp;summarizes the rates of these harms per screening round using registry data for digital mammography from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC), a collaborative network of 5 mammography registries and 2 affiliated sites with linkages to tumor registries across the United States.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2"">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation9"">9</a>&nbsp;(Note that&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab2"">Table 2</a>&nbsp;describes a different time horizon than&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab1"">Table 1</a>&nbsp;[per screening round rather than per decade]).
<h3>When to Start Screening</h3>
Clinical trials, observational studies, and modeling studies all demonstrate that the likelihood of avoiding a breast cancer death with regular screening mammography increases with age, and this increase in benefit likely occurs gradually rather than abruptly at any particular age. In contrast, the harms of screening mammography either remain constant or decrease with age. For example, about the same number of breast biopsies are performed as a result of screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years as in those aged 60 to 69 years, but many more of these biopsies will result in a diagnosis of invasive cancer in the older age group. Thus, the balance of benefit and harms improves with age (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab3"">Table 3</a>). <br /><br />The USPSTF concludes that while there are harms of mammography, the benefit of screening mammography outweighs the harms by at least a moderate amount from age 50 to 74 years and is greatest for women in their 60s. For women in their 40s, the number who benefit from starting regular screening mammography is smaller and the number experiencing harm is larger compared with older women. For women in their 40s, the benefit still outweighs the harms, but to a smaller degree; this balance may therefore be more subject to individual values and preferences than it is in older women. Women in their 40s must weigh a very important but infrequent benefit (reduction in breast cancer deaths) against a group of meaningful and more common harms (overdiagnosis and overtreatment, unnecessary and sometimes invasive follow-up testing and psychological harms associated with false-positive test results, and false reassurance from false-negative test results). Women who value the possible benefit of screening mammography more than they value avoiding its harms can make an informed decision to begin screening. <br /><br />Neither clinical trials nor models can precisely predict the potential benefits and harms that an individual woman can expect from beginning screening at age 40 rather than 50 years, as these data represent population effects. However, model results may be the easiest way for women to visualize the relative tradeoffs of beginning screening at age 40 versus 50 years. CISNET conducted modeling studies to predict the lifetime benefits and harms of screening with contemporary digital mammography at different starting and stopping ages and screening intervals. The models varied their assumptions about the natural history of invasive and noninvasive breast cancer and the effect of detection by digital mammography on survival. The models assumed the ideal circumstances of perfect adherence to screening and current best practices for therapy across the life span.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab3"">Table 3</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>compares the median and range across the models for predicted lifetime benefits and harms of screening biennially from ages 50 to 74 years with screening biennially from ages 40 to 74 years. (Note that&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab3"">Table 3</a>&nbsp;differs from Tables&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab1"">1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab2"">2</a>&nbsp;in terms of population metrics [per 1000 vs. 10,000 women] and time horizon considered [lifetime vs. 10-year or single event]). <br /><br />It is, however, a false dichotomy to assume that the only options are to begin screening at age 40 or to wait until age 50 years. As women advance through their 40s, the incidence of breast cancer rises. The balance of benefit and harms may also shift accordingly over this decade, such that women in the latter half of the decade likely have a more favorable balance than women in the first half. Indeed, the CISNET models suggest that most of the benefit of screening women aged 40 to 49 years would be realized by starting screening at age 45.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation7"">7</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation8"">8</a>
<h3>Risk Factors That May Influence When to Start Screening</h3>
Advancing age is the most important risk factor for breast cancer in most women, but epidemiologic data from the BCSC suggest that having a first-degree relative with breast cancer is associated with an approximately 2-fold increased risk for breast cancer in women aged 40 to 49 years.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2"">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation9"">9</a>&nbsp;Further, the CISNET models suggest that for women with about a 2-fold increased risk for breast cancer, starting annual digital screening at age 40 years results in a similar harm-to-benefit ratio (based on number of false-positive results or overdiagnosed cases per 1000 breast cancer deaths avoided) as beginning biennial digital screening at age 50 years in average-risk women.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation7"">7</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation8"">8</a>&nbsp;This approach has not been formally tested in a clinical trial; therefore, there is no direct evidence that it would result in net benefit similar to that of women aged 50 to 74 years. However, given the increased burden of disease and potential likelihood of benefit, women aged 40 to 49 years who have a known first-degree relative (parent, child, or sibling) with breast cancer may consider initiating screening earlier than age 50 years. Many other risk factors have been associated with breast cancer in epidemiologic studies, but most of these relationships are weak or inconsistent and would not likely influence how women value the tradeoffs of the potential benefits and harms of screening. Risk calculators, such as the National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (available at<a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/BCRISKTOOL"" target=""_blank"">www.cancer.gov/BCRISKTOOL</a><a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/exit-disclaimer"" title=""This link goes offsite.
Click to read the external link disclaimer"" class=""extLink"">This link goes offsite. Click to read the external link disclaimer</a>), have good calibration between predicted and actual outcomes in groups of women but are not accurate at predicting an individual woman&rsquo;s risk for breast cancer.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation10"">10</a>
<h3>How Often to Screen</h3>
Once a woman has decided to begin screening, the next decision is how often to undergo screening. No clinical trials compared annual mammography with a longer interval in women of any age. In the randomized trials that demonstrated the effectiveness of mammography in reducing breast cancer deaths in women aged 40 to 74 years, screening intervals ranged from 12 to 33 months.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2"">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation3"">3</a>&nbsp;There was no clear trend for greater benefit in trials of annual mammography, but other differences between the trials preclude certainty that no difference in benefit exists. Available observational evidence evaluating the effects of varying mammography intervals found no difference in the number of breast cancer deaths between women aged 50 years or older who were screened biennially versus annually.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2"">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation3"">3</a> <br /><br />Regardless of the starting age for screening, the models consistently predict a small incremental increase in the number of breast cancer deaths averted when moving from biennial to annual mammography, but also a large increase in the number of harms (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab4"">Table 4</a>).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation7"">7</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation8"">8</a>&nbsp;The USPSTF concludes that for most women, biennial mammography screening provides the best overall balance of benefit and harms.
<h3>When to Consider Stopping Screening</h3>
Clinical trial data for women aged 70 to 74 years are inconclusive. In its 2009 recommendation,<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation11"">11</a>&nbsp;the USPSTF extended the recommendation for screening mammography to age 74 years based on the extrapolation that much of the benefit seen in women aged 60 to 69 years should continue in this age range, and modeling done at the time supported this assumption. Current CISNET models suggest that women aged 70 to 74 years with moderate to severe comorbid conditions that negatively affect their life expectancy are unlikely to benefit from mammography.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation7"">7</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation8"">8</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation12"">12</a>&nbsp;Moderate comorbid conditions include cardiovascular disease, paralysis, and diabetes. Severe comorbid conditions include (but are not limited to) AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, chronic renal failure, dementia, congestive heart failure, and combinations of moderate comorbid conditions, as well as myocardial infarction, ulcer, and rheumatologic disease.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation12"">12</a>
<h3>Screening in Women Aged 75 Years or Older</h3>
The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women aged 75 years or older. CISNET models suggest that biennial mammography screening may potentially continue to offer a net benefit after age 74 years among women with no or low comorbidity,<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation7"">7</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation8"">8</a>&nbsp;but no randomized trials of screening included women in this age group.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2"">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation3"">3</a>
<h3>DBT as a Primary Screening Strategy</h3>
The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of DBT as a primary screening method for breast cancer.
<h4>Background</h4>
Evidence on DBT is limited; a single study on the test characteristics of DBT as a primary screening strategy for breast cancer met the inclusion criteria of the systematic evidence review.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation13"">13</a>
<h4>Potential Benefits</h4>
From the limited data available, DBT seems to reduce recall rates (that is, follow-up for additional imaging or testing) and increase cancer detection rates compared with conventional digital mammography alone.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation13"">13</a>&nbsp;However, current study designs cannot determine whether all of the additional cases of cancer detected would have become clinically significant (that is, the degree of overdiagnosis) or whether there is an incremental clinical benefit to detecting these cancers earlier than with conventional digital mammography. In addition, no studies of DBT looked at clinical outcomes, such as breast cancer morbidity or mortality or quality of life.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation13"">13</a>
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
As currently practiced in most settings, DBT exposes women to approximately twice the amount of radiation as conventional digital mammography.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation13"">13</a>&nbsp;In 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a method to generate synthetic reconstruction of 2-dimensional images from 3-dimensional views, which reduces the total radiation dose associated with DBT. Although the extent to which this new software technology has been implemented in mammography screening centers is not precisely known, it is currently thought to be low. In women with abnormal findings, DBT may also increase the rate of breast biopsy compared with conventional digital mammography.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation13"">13</a>
<h3>Primary and Adjunctive Screening in Women With Dense Breasts</h3>
The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of adjunctive screening for breast cancer using breast ultrasonography, MRI, DBT, or other methods in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram.
<h4>Epidemiology of Dense Breasts</h4>
In the United States, the most commonly used classification system for breast density is the American College of Radiology&rsquo;s Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 4-category scale (a = the breasts are almost entirely fatty; b = there are scattered areas of fibroglandular density; c = the breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses; or d = the breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography). Data from the BCSC indicate that about 25 million women (about 43%) aged 40 to 74 years are classified as having heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts. The proportion of women with dense breasts is highest among those aged 40 to 49 years and decreases with age.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation14"">14</a> <br /><br />Increased breast density is a risk factor for breast cancer. Data from the BCSC indicate that, compared with women with average breast density, women aged 40 to 49 years with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts have a relative risk (RR) of 1.23 for developing invasive breast cancer. For women aged 50 to 64 years with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts, the RR is 1.29, and for women aged 65 to 74 years, it is 1.30.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation7"">7</a>&nbsp;However, women with dense breasts who develop breast cancer do not have an increased risk for dying from the disease, after adjustment for stage, treatment, method of detection, and other risk factors, according to data from the BCSC.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation15"">15</a>
<h4>Primary Screening Test Performance Characteristics</h4>
Increased breast density reduces the sensitivity and specificity of mammography for detecting cancer. A BCSC study of more than 300,000 women found that sensitivity decreased from 87% in the lowest density category to 63% in the highest, and specificity decreased from 96% to 90% as breast density increased.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation16"">16</a> <br /><br />A woman&rsquo;s BI-RADS breast density classification can be inconstant over time. Good-quality studies of U.S. radiologists demonstrate that major recategorization of sequential screening examinations (that is, from &ldquo;dense&rdquo; [c/d] to &ldquo;nondense&rdquo; [a/b] or vice versa) occurs in approximately 13% to 19% of women.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation17"">17</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation18"">18</a>&nbsp;These studies excluded women taking hormone medications or those with other medical conditions that may have resulted in physiologic changes that would explain the difference in breast density classification observed between examinations. Reclassification of breast density status from year to year complicates women&rsquo;s assessment of their underlying breast cancer risk, as well as informed screening and care decisions.
<h4>Primary Screening Frequency</h4>
In 1 BCSC study, biennial screening mammography was associated with greater risk for advanced-stage cancer (stage IIB or greater) (odds ratio, 2.39 [CI, 1.06 to 3.39]) or a breast tumor larger than 20 mm (odds ratio, 2.39 [CI, 1.37 to 3.18]) in women aged 40 to 49 years with extremely dense breasts (BI-RADS category d) compared with annual screening; this risk was not seen in women aged 50 to 74 years.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation19"">19</a>&nbsp;No significant differences in lymph node involvement were observed in either age group. Information about morbidity or mortality end points is not available, so whether these women ultimately fared any differently in their clinical outcomes is not known.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation17"">17</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation19"">19</a> <br /><br />All women aged 40 to 74 years with increased breast density are at increased risk for a false-positive result, an unnecessary breast biopsy, or a false-negative result compared with women with average breast density. Screening more frequently (that is, annually vs. biennially) further increases the probability that a woman will experience one of these screening-related harms. Data from the BCSC indicate that the cumulative probability that a woman aged 40 to 49 years with extremely dense breasts screened annually for a decade will receive a false-positive result is about 69%, compared with about 21% for biennial screening. Similarly, unnecessary breast biopsy rates are 12% for annual screening versus 3% for biennial screening.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation17"">17</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation18"">18</a>
<h4>Adjunctive Screening</h4>
<strong>Potential benefits.</strong>&nbsp;Current evidence on adjunctive screening is very limited, but it suggests that for women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative mammogram, ultrasonography or MRI will detect additional breast cancer but will also result in a higher number of false-positive results. Data on DBT in women with dense breasts are limited, but in the short term, DBT also detects additional breast cancer. Most of the additional cancer detected by these methods are invasive tumors rather than ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation17"">17</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation18"">18</a>&nbsp;A short-term increase in the number of cancer cases detected does not allow for the conclusion that adjunctive screening reduces treatment-related morbidity or breast cancer deaths or improves women&rsquo;s quality of life. Although adjunctive screening may detect more breast cancer, these cancers may fall into 1 of 3 categories: 1) those for which earlier detection leads to improved outcomes, 2) those that would have had the same outcome when detected later, or 3) those that are overdiagnosed and would not have caused a health problem during a woman&rsquo;s lifetime and may result in harms from unnecessary treatment. Existing data do not allow for estimation of the proportion of cancer that falls into each category; therefore, the benefits on health cannot be estimated. <br /><br /><strong>Potential harms.</strong>&nbsp;Most positive adjunctive breast cancer screening test results are false positive. Compared with mammography alone, adjunctive screening with ultrasonography or MRI seems to increase recall and biopsy rates. Data on the effects of DBT on recall and biopsy rates in women with dense breasts are too limited to draw conclusions.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation17"">17</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation18"">18</a>&nbsp;The effects of DBT on overdiagnosis rates are unknown. <br /><br /><strong>Current practice.</strong>&nbsp;At the present time, 24 states require patient notification of breast density status when mammography is performed; in some states, legislation also includes language to be sent to women informing them that they should consider adjunctive screening.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation17"">17</a>No clinical practice guidelines explicitly recommend adjunctive screening in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation17"">17</a>
<h4>Assessment</h4>
Increased breast density is very common. It is an independent risk factor for developing (but not dying of) breast cancer, and it reduces mammography&rsquo;s ability to find and accurately identify breast cancer. Many women will move between &ldquo;dense&rdquo; and &ldquo;nondense&rdquo; breast classifications with sequential screening mammograms, and these reclassifications are not primarily due to physiologic causes. More evidence is needed to better understand how the frequency of screening might affect important health outcomes in women with dense breasts. Overall, many important questions remain about the potential role of breast density in individualizing screening approaches, and the current evidence is insufficient to recommend a specific screening strategy for women with increased breast density.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
The USPSTF has made recommendations about the use of medications to reduce women&rsquo;s risk for breast cancer, as well as risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for&nbsp;<em>BRCA1-</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>BRCA2</em>-related cancer (including breast cancer). These recommendations are available on the USPSTF Web site (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#Pod6,159,"<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Trial data are too limited to directly inform the question of what the best screening strategy is for women or how clinicians can best tailor that strategy to the individual. Overdiagnosis and resulting overtreatment of breast cancer that would otherwise not have become a threat to a woman&rsquo;s health during her lifetime is the most important harm associated with breast cancer screening. Because it is impossible to determine for any individual patient whether a diagnosed cancer will or will not progress, measurements of overdiagnosis are not straightforward but rather are indirectly quantified. Current estimates of the magnitude of overdiagnosis associated with mammography screening vary widely. Researchers in the field must work together to critically evaluate and ultimately agree on uniform definitions and standards to optimally measure and monitor overdiagnosis and overtreatment in breast cancer screening programs. In addition, research is critically needed to identify ways to reduce the occurrence of overdiagnosis and subsequent overtreatment associated with breast cancer screening. Ductal carcinoma in situ is an example of a breast lesion with the potential for high rates of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Before the widespread use of screening mammography, 6 cases of DCIS per 100,000 U.S. women per year were identified compared with 37 cases of DCIS per 100,000 women per year after its introduction.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation5"">5</a>&nbsp;When classified as cancer, DCIS now accounts for about 1 in 4 of all breast cancer diagnosed in a given year.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation20"">20</a>&nbsp;However, its nomenclature has recently been the subject of debate, because by definition, DCIS is confined to the mammary ductal&ndash;lobular system and is incapable of metastasis (that is, it is noninvasive and thus lacks the classic characteristic of cancer).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation21"">21</a>&nbsp;Ductal carcinoma in situ may therefore be more appropriately classified as a risk factor for future development of cancer; the primary goal in its management is to reduce the incidence of new invasive carcinoma. The natural history of DCIS&mdash;particularly screen-detected DCIS&mdash;is poorly understood. Although a substantial proportion of these lesions will not progress to invasive cancer,<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation22"">22</a>&nbsp;which women will and which will not develop such cancer cannot be predicted with certainty. As such, nearly all women diagnosed with DCIS receive treatment (generally either mastectomy or lumpectomy with or without radiation; a chemopreventive agent, such as tamoxifen, may also be offered).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation23"">23</a>&nbsp;The 20-year breast cancer mortality rate after treatment of DCIS is as low as 3%;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation24"">24</a>&nbsp;whether this is due to the effectiveness of the interventions or the fact that most DCIS cases being treated are essentially benign is a pressing research question. Research is needed to develop better prognostic indicators to distinguish nonprogressive or slowly progressive lesions from tumors that are likely to affect quality or length of life. Research is also needed to compare the long-term benefits and harms of immediate treatment versus observation or surveillance with delayed intervention in women with screen-detected DCIS. Most of the available screening trials and high-quality cohort studies were performed in Europe and predominately enrolled white women younger than age 70 years. Direct evidence about any differential effectiveness of breast cancer screening is lacking for important subgroups of women, such as African American women, who are at increased risk for dying of breast cancer, and older women, for whom balancing the potential benefits and harms of screening may become increasingly challenging with advancing age. Newer technologies, such as DBT for primary screening or ultrasonography and MRI for adjunctive screening in women with dense breasts, are being increasingly used in the United States without clear evidence to demonstrate their effectiveness in improving important health outcomes. Such studies are necessary prerequisites for the appropriate incorporation of these methods into established screening programs.Finally, a large proportion of women in the United States are classified as having dense breasts after screening mammography. Increased breast density is common in the general population; however, critical questions remain about how best to manage this condition and to support these women. Research to help improve the validity and reproducibility of serial BI-RADS assessments would be useful if breast density is to be considered as a factor for personalized, risk-based approaches to breast cancer screening. In addition, long-term randomized trials or longitudinal cohort studies are needed that compare screening outcomes in women with dense breasts who are not otherwise at increased risk for breast cancer who receive adjunctive screening versus those who do not and report important outcomes, such as breast cancer stage at diagnosis, breast cancer recurrence rates, rates of overdiagnosis, and most importantly, breast cancer mortality.",,"<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Breast cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States. In 2015, an estimated 232,000 women were diagnosed with the disease and 40,000 women died of it. It is most frequently diagnosed among women aged 55 to 64 years, and the median age of death from breast cancer is 68 years.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation1""><br /></a></p>
<h3>Benefit and Harms of Screening and Early Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that mammography screening reduces breast cancer mortality in women aged 40 to 74 years. The number of breast cancer deaths averted increases with age; women aged 40 to 49 years benefit the least and women aged 60 to 69 years benefit the most. Age is the most important risk factor for breast cancer, and the increased benefit observed with age is at least partly due to the increase in risk. Women aged 40 to 49 years who have a first-degree relative with breast cancer have a risk for breast cancer similar to that of women aged 50 to 59 years without a family history. Direct evidence about the benefits of screening mammography in women aged 75 years or older is lacking.<br /><br />The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for breast cancer with mammography results in harms for women aged 40 to 74 years. The most important harm is the diagnosis and treatment of noninvasive and invasive breast cancer that would otherwise not have become a threat to a woman&rsquo;s health, or even apparent, during her lifetime (that is, overdiagnosis and overtreatment). False-positive results are common and lead to unnecessary and sometimes invasive follow-up testing, with the potential for psychological harms (such as anxiety). False-negative results (that is, missed cancer) also occur and may provide false reassurance. Radiation-induced breast cancer and resulting death can also occur, although the number of both of these events is predicted to be low.<br /><br />The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits and harms of DBT as a primary screening method for breast cancer. Similarly, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits and harms of adjunctive screening for breast cancer using breast ultrasonography, MRI, DBT, or other methods in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram. In both cases, while there is some information about the accuracy of these methods, there is no information on the effects of their use on health outcomes, such as breast cancer incidence, mortality, or overdiagnosis rates.</p>

"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to adults aged 40 to 70 years seen in primary care settings who do not have symptoms of diabetes and are overweight or obese. The target population includes persons who are most likely to have glucose abnormalities that are associated with increased CVD risk and can be expected to benefit from primary prevention of CVD through risk factor modification.<br /><br />Persons who have a family history of diabetes, have a history of gestational diabetes or polycystic ovarian syndrome, or are members of certain racial/ethnic groups (that is, African Americans, American Indians or Alaskan Natives, Asian Americans, Hispanics or Latinos, or Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders) may be at increased risk for diabetes at a younger age or at a lower body mass index. Clinicians should consider screening earlier in persons with 1 or more of these characteristics.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Glucose abnormalities can be detected by measuring HbA1c&nbsp;or fasting plasma glucose or with an oral glucose tolerance test. The&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/screening-for-abnormal-blood-glucose-and-type-2-diabetes#tab"">Table</a>shows test values for normal glucose metabolism, IFG, IGT, and type 2 diabetes. Hemoglobin A1c&nbsp;is a measure of long-term blood glucose concentration and is not affected by acute changes in glucose levels due to stress or illness. Because HbA1c&nbsp;measurements do not require fasting, they are more convenient than using a fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test. The oral glucose tolerance test is done in the morning in a fasting state; blood glucose concentration is measured 2 hours after ingestion of a 75-g oral glucose load.<br /><br />The diagnosis of IFG, IGT, or type 2 diabetes should be confirmed; repeated testing with the same test on a different day is the preferred method of confirmation.
<h3>Threshold for Behavioral Interventions</h3>
Many studies assessed intensive behavioral interventions for persons at increased CVD risk, but none report a consistent threshold for intervention among persons with abnormal blood glucose. Many studies include persons with multiple risk factors, and CVD risk increases with the number of risk factors and glucose level. Perceived readiness for change and access to appropriate interventions will probably influence treatment recommendations. Although direct evidence that preventing a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes results in improved health outcomes is limited, primary prevention that reduces the chances of a diagnosis may reduce the adverse consequences of disease management. Because the average reduction in glucose levels resulting from intensive behavioral interventions is modest, persons with higher glucose levels may be more likely to benefit and avoid a diabetes diagnosis than those whose glucose levels are closer to normal.
<h3>Type of Intervention</h3>
Behavioral interventions that have an effect on CVD risk and delay or avoid progression of glucose abnormalities to type 2 diabetes combine counseling on a healthful diet and physical activity and are intensive, with multiple contacts over extended periods. The evidence is insufficient to conclude that pharmacologic interventions have the same multifactorial benefits (for example, weight loss or reductions in glucose levels, blood pressure, and lipid levels) as behavioral interventions.
<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>
Evidence on the optimal rescreening interval for adults with an initial normal glucose test result is limited.&nbsp;Cohort and modeling studies suggest that rescreening every 3 years may be a reasonable approach for adults with normal blood glucose levels.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
Because overweight and obesity, physical inactivity, abnormal lipid levels, high blood pressure, and smoking are all modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular events, the USPSTF recommends screening and appropriate interventions for these conditions (available at<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).<br /><br />The USPSTF recommends screening for obesity in adults and offering or referring those with a body mass index of 30 kg/m2&nbsp;or greater to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions. Although intensive interventions may not be practical in many primary care settings, patients can be referred from primary care to community-based programs for these interventions.<br /><br />The USPSTF recommends offering or referring adults who are overweight (body mass index &gt;25 kg/m2) and have additional cardiovascular risk factors to intensive behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity for CVD prevention.<br /><br />The USPSTF recommends screening for lipid disorders in men aged 35 years or older and women aged 45 years or older who are at increased risk for coronary heart disease. <br /><br />The USPSTF also recommends screening for hypertension in adults aged 18 years or older and that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use and provide tobacco cessation interventions to those who use tobacco products.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends combined diet and physical activity promotion programs for persons who are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes. It found that these programs are effective across a range of counseling intensities, settings, and facilitators. Effective programs commonly include setting a weight loss goal, individual or group sessions about diet and exercise, meetings with a trained diet or exercise counselor, or individually tailored diet or exercise plans.

<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
The USPSTF found only 2 studies, both conducted in Europe,&nbsp;that directly evaluated the mortality benefit of screening in asymptomatic adults. Neither study had follow-up beyond 10 years or measured nonfatal cardiovascular events. Screening studies that follow larger numbers of participants for 20 years or longer and measure both morbidity and mortality are needed. Further, screening studies in the U.S. population (in which the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes is probably higher than that identified in European studies [3%]) are needed. More research is needed on the effects of screening among racial/ethnic minorities because they have a higher prevalence of diabetes than white persons. Clinical trials and additional modeling studies are needed to better elucidate the optimal frequency of screening and the age at which to start screening. More U.S. data are also needed on the benefits and harms of lifestyle interventions and medical treatments for screen-detected IFG, IGT, and diabetes over a longer follow-up period.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/screening-for-abnormal-blood-glucose-and-type-2-diabetes#Pod5,158,"The American Diabetes Association&nbsp;recommends screening for diabetes in adults aged 45 years or older and screening in persons with multiple risk factors regardless of age. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists,&nbsp;American Academy of Family Physicians,&nbsp;Diabetes Australia,&nbsp;Diabetes UK&nbsp;and the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care&nbsp;recommend screening for diabetes in persons with risk factors only.","Burden of Disease
Impaired glucose metabolism initially develops as IFG or IGT and may progress to diabetes. From 2009 to 2012, an estimated 37% of U.S. adults aged 20 years or older had IFG or IGT and 12% had diabetes.1 After adjustment for population age differences, the percentage of U.S. adults aged 20 years or older with IFG or IGT was similar among white (35%), black (39%), and Hispanic persons (38%). However, diabetes prevalence rates were higher among racial/ethnic minorities than non-Hispanic white persons (7.6%). Among Hispanics, the age-adjusted rate for diagnosed diabetes was 12.8%, with higher rates among Mexican Americans (13.9%) and Puerto Ricans (14.8%). Among Asian Americans, the diabetes prevalence rate was 9.0%, with higher rates among Filipinos (11.3%) and Asian Indians (13.0%). From 2010 to 2012, diabetes prevalence rates were 13.2% for black persons and 15.9% for American Indians and Alaskan Natives.
Uncontrolled diabetes is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity and may also result in other complications, such as vision loss, renal failure, and amputation. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, accounting for more than 44% of new cases of end-stage renal disease in 2011. About 60% of nontraumatic lower-limb amputations occur in persons with diabetes. Among adults of a similar age, the risk for death is 1.5 times higher in those with diabetes than in those without it.1
Scope of Review
To update its 2008 recommendation, the USPSTF reviewed studies from the prior evidence review and evidence from new trials published since then. The current review focused on screening for IFG, IGT, and type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults who are at average or high risk for diabetes and its complications.2, 10 The USPSTF examined whether measuring blood glucose to detect diabetes, IFG, or IGT in asymptomatic adults results in improved health outcomes; whether interventions for IFG or IGT prevent or delay progression to type 2 diabetes; and whether interventions for screen-detected IFG, IGT, or type 2 diabetes provide an incremental benefit in health outcomes compared with no interventions or initiating interventions after clinical diagnosis.
The USPSTF also examined the harms of screening and interventions for IFG, IGT, and type 2 diabetes. The evidence review assessed the benefits and harms of aspirin use and intensive versus standard control of blood glucose levels, blood pressure, and lipid levels in persons with diagnosed diabetes. In addition, the USPSTF examined whether the effects of screening and interventions differ by subpopulation (for example, older adults, men vs. women, or racial/ethnic minorities).
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment
Benefits of Screening
Since the previous review, 2 new trials conducted in Europe have examined the effects of screening versus no screening. ADDITION-Cambridge (Anglo-Danish-Dutch Study of Intensive Treatment In People With Screen-Detected Diabetes in Primary Care)8 was a good-quality, cluster randomized, controlled trial with 19,226 participants, screening at 27 sites, and no screening at 5 sites. The hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality at 10-year follow-up was 1.06 (95% CI, 0.90 to 1.25). No differences were found between the screened and nonscreened groups in cardiovascular-, cancer-, or diabetes-related mortality or death from other causes. Limitations of this study include lack of longer-term (>10 years) follow-up and lack of data on other macrovascular and microvascular outcomes, such as nonfatal cardiovascular events.
A second study,9 conducted at a single site in the United Kingdom (n = 4936), resulted in a moderate significant reduction in all-cause mortality (HR, 0.79 [CI, 0.63 to 1.00]). Data on other health outcomes were limited. The USPSTF considered this study to be of fair to poor quality because of unclear randomization and allocation concealment methods and important baseline difference between the screened and nonscreened groups.
Given the limitations of these 2 studies, the USPSTF determined that the evidence is inadequate to determine the direct benefits and harms of screening versus no screening.
Interventions to Prevent or Delay Progression to Type 2 Diabetes
The USPSTF identified 10 studies (6 new and 4 included in the previous review) that focused on lifestyle interventions to prevent or delay progression to type 2 diabetes.2 A meta-analysis of these 10 trials showed a relative risk (RR) of 0.53 (CI, 0.39 to 0.72; I2 = 88%). The USPSTF determined that there is adequate evidence that lifestyle interventions can prevent or delay progression to type 2 diabetes.
The USPSTF identified 8 studies published since the prior review that assessed the effects of pharmacologic interventions to prevent or delay progression to diabetes.2 Metformin, thiazolidinediones, and α-glucosidase inhibitors were all found to be effective in preventing or delaying progression to type 2 diabetes.
Effects of Screening Versus Not Screening and Initiating Interventions After Clinical Diagnosis
The USPSTF found no trials that evaluated the incremental benefit on health outcomes of initiating interventions after clinical diagnosis compared with at the time of screening.
The USPSTF identified 3 trials that suggested benefit of lifestyle interventions in patients with IFG or IGT. The Diabetes Prevention Program,11 conducted in the United States in 3234 participants, found that an intensive lifestyle modification intervention was associated with better quality of life at 3-year follow-up.
One Finnish12 and 1 Chinese13 trial, each with more than 500 participants, suggested improvements in all-cause mortality outcomes after 10 and 20 years, respectively (HR, 0.57 [CI, 0.21 to 1.58] and 0.96 [CI, 0.65 to 1.14], respectively), but these trials were underpowered to evaluate these outcomes. However, by 23-year follow-up, the Chinese trial found decreased risk for cardiovascular mortality (HR, 0.59 [CI, 0.36 to 0.96]) and all-cause mortality (HR, 0.71 [CI, 0.51 to 0.99]) in the intervention group compared with the control group.14 These findings were primarily due to significant differences in mortality outcomes between women in the intervention and control groups (all-cause mortality HR, 0.46 [CI, 0.24 to 0.87]; cardiovascular mortality HR, 0.28 [CI, 0.11 to 0.71]). The lifestyle intervention had no significant effect on all-cause or cardiovascular mortality in men (all-cause mortality HR, 0.97 [CI, 0.65 to 1.46]; cardiovascular mortality HR, 0.91 [CI, 0.50 to 1.65]). Post hoc analyses suggested that the reduced mortality associated with the intervention was mediated by its effect on delaying the onset of diabetes.
Pharmacologic interventions for screen-detected IFG, IGT, or diabetes showed no reduction in cardiovascular mortality based on a meta-analysis of 5 trials, with a mean follow-up of 3 to 6 years (risk ratio, 1.07 [CI, 0.84 to 1.35]; I2 = 0%).2
Benefits of Intensive Versus Standard Control of Blood Glucose Levels, Blood Pressure, and Lipid Levels
Among patients with diagnosed diabetes (that is, not screen-detected), intensive glycemic control was not associated with reduced risk for all-cause or cardiovascular mortality compared with standard glycemic control.15 Intensive glycemic control was associated with reduced risk for nonfatal myocardial infarction and microvascular disease but increased risk for severe hypoglycemia.15, 16
To assess whether intensive blood pressure control was associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality and morbidity compared with standard control, the USPSTF examined the results of 5 trials—ABCD (Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes), ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes), ADVANCE (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron-MR Controlled Evaluation), HOT (Hypertension Optimal Treatment), and the UKPDS (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study).17-22 These trials had heterogeneous populations, medications, and blood pressure goals. No clear benefit was found in all-cause or cardiovascular mortality with intensive blood pressure control. However, a consistent benefit of stroke reduction was found in study groups with intensive versus standard blood pressure control.23, 24 For example, in the ACCORD trial, the target systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg was associated with an RR of 0.58 (CI, 0.39 to 0.88) for stroke incidence compared with standard blood pressure control (target systolic blood pressure of <140 mm Hg).
The USPSTF found no studies on the effects of intensive versus standard lipid control in persons with screen-detected diabetes. The ACCORD study25 found that intensive lipid-lowering therapy was associated with reduced risk for a composite cardiovascular outcome in men with diabetes but possible harm in women (interaction P = 0.01).25
Lipid-lowering therapy seemed to be similarly effective in RR reduction regardless of diabetes status. A Japanese study26 that randomly assigned approximately 8000 participants to pravastatin versus placebo found similar estimates of risk for all-cause mortality, stroke, and cardiovascular events in participants with diabetes, IFG or IGT, or normal blood glucose levels. A meta-analysis of 14 trials of statins27 found similar risks for vascular events in both persons with diabetes (RR, 0.79 [CI, 0.72 to 0.87]) and without diabetes (RR, 0.79 [CI, 0.76 to 0.82]).
Benefits of Multifactorial Interventions
The ADDITION-Europe trial28, 29 evaluated the effects of intensive versus standard control of blood glucose levels, blood pressure, and lipid levels in a population with screen-detected diabetes (mean HbA1c level was 6.5% for both groups at baseline). No significant differences were found between study groups in risk for all-cause mortality (HR, 0.83 [CI, 0.65 to 1.05]) or cardiovascular mortality (HR, 0.88 [CI, 0.51 to 1.51]). In addition, no significant differences were found in risk for stroke (HR, 0.98 [CI, 0.57 to 1.71]), myocardial infarction (HR, 0.70 [CI, 0.41 to 1.21]), or revascularization (HR, 0.79 [CI, 0.52 to 1.18]) after 5-year follow-up.
The USPSTF identified 4 trials of multifactorial interventions in persons with existing diabetes. Baseline HbA1c levels (range, 7.4% to 8.8%) were higher among these trial participants than in the ADDITION-Europe trial. The ADVANCE trial found reduced risk for all-cause mortality (RR, 0.83 [CI, 0.70 to 0.99]) and cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.76 [CI, 0.60 to 0.98]) at 4-year follow-up.30 Similarly, the Steno-2 Study31 showed a reduction in all-cause mortality (RR, 0.60 [CI, 0.40 to 0.90]) and cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.47 [CI, 0.23 to 0.98]) after 13-year follow-up.31 However, SANDS (Stop Atherosclerosis in Native Diabetics),32 conducted in American Indians, and JEDIT (Japanese Elderly Diabetes Intervention Trial)33 in Japan showed no difference between intensive and standard therapy after 3- and 6-year follow-up, respectively.
Benefits of Aspirin Use
The USPSTF identified 2 systematic reviews,34, 35 that found no significant differences in RR reduction between aspirin use and nonuse in persons with diabetes.
Differential Effects of Screening or Interventions by Subpopulation
The USPSTF found no studies that directly evaluated whether the effects of screening vary by subpopulation, such as by age, sex, or race/ethnicity.
Harms of Screening and Interventions
The USPSTF found limited evidence on the harms of screening for IFG, IGT, or diabetes. One study36 found that invitation to screening and a new diagnosis of diabetes were associated with short-term anxiety, but 2 longer-term studies37, 38 found no negative psychological effects associated with screening or a new diagnosis. The diagnosis of IFG or IGT may potentially create harm through labeling. No studies to date have shown this effect, however, and it is unclear whether the harms of labeling a person at risk would be counteracted by the potential benefits of reducing that person’s chances of developing diabetes.
Two studies compared lifestyle interventions with usual care and reported no difference in all-cause withdrawal rates39 or adverse events.40
The Diabetes Prevention Program41 reported no differences in serious or nonserious events between the metformin and placebo groups. One trial found that acarbose was associated with higher risk for withdrawal because of adverse events compared with placebo.42 One large trial found that nateglinide43 was associated with increased risk for hypoglycemia compared with placebo (RR, 1.73 [CI, 1.57 to 1.92]); further, valsartan was associated44 with hypotension-related adverse events (RR, 1.16 [CI, 1.11 to 1.23]). One trial45 found that rosiglitazone was associated with increased risk for congestive heart failure (HR, 7.04 [CI, 1.6 to 31]), but the estimate was imprecise.
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF assessed the overall benefit of screening for IFG, IGT, and diabetes to be moderate. The effects of lifestyle interventions to prevent or delay progression to diabetes were consistent across a substantive body of literature. Limited data from longer-term studies suggest that these interventions may also be associated with improved health outcomes. The potential harms of measuring blood glucose and initiating lifestyle modifications that include healthy eating behaviors and increased physical activity are small to none, which leads the USPSTF to conclude with moderate certainty that these interventions have a moderate net benefit.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 7 October 2014 to 5 November 2014. The USPSTF reviewed all public comments received. In response, the USPSTF revised the final recommendation to clarify the populations considered to be at increased risk and provided more details about lifestyle interventions found to be most effective for prevention. The USPSTF also reexamined the potential harms of labeling associated with screening and found limited harms.","<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, and nearly one quarter of deaths caused by CVD are considered to be preventable. Modifiable cardiovascular risk factors include abnormal blood glucose, hypertension, hyperlipidemia or dyslipidemia, smoking, overweight and obesity, physical inactivity, and an unhealthy diet. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency, resulting in hyperglycemia. Type 2 diabetes typically develops slowly, and progression from normal blood glucose to glucose abnormalities that meet generally accepted criteria for diabetes (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/screening-for-abnormal-blood-glucose-and-type-2-diabetes#tab"">Table</a>) may take a decade or longer. Glucose abnormalities that do not meet the criteria for diabetes include impaired fasting glucose (IFG), an impaired response to oral glucose intake (impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]), or an increased average blood glucose level as evidenced by increased levels of hemoglobin A1c&nbsp;(HbA1c). Abnormal glucose metabolism is a risk factor for CVD and, in some individuals, may progress to meet the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes. <br /><br />According to national data estimates from 2012, approximately 86 million Americans aged 20 years or older have IFG or IGT.Approximately 15% to 30% of these persons will develop type 2 diabetes within 5 years if they do not implement lifestyle changes to improve their health. <br /><br />Modifiable risk factors for abnormal glucose metabolism (manifested as either diabetes or abnormal glucose levels below the threshold for diabetes) include overweight and obesity or a high percentage of abdominal fat, physical inactivity, and smoking. Abnormal glucose metabolism is also frequently associated with other cardiovascular risk factors, such as hyperlipidemia and hypertension.<br /><br />Given the increasing prevalence of abnormal glucose metabolism in the U.S. population, the USPSTF sought to examine the benefits and harms of screening for IFG, IGT, and type 2 diabetes.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence that measuring blood glucose leads to improvements in mortality or cardiovascular morbidity.<br /><br />The USPSTF previously found adequate evidence that intensive behavioral counseling interventions for persons at increased risk for CVD have moderate benefits in lowering CVD risk. Populations in which these benefits have been shown include persons who are obese or overweight and have hypertension, hyperlipidemia or dyslipidemia, and/or IFG or IGT. Benefits of behavioral interventions include reductions in blood pressure, glucose and lipid levels, and obesity and an increase in physical activity. Studies that specifically treat persons who have IFG or IGT with intensive lifestyle interventions to prevent the development of diabetes consistently show a moderate benefit in reducing progression to diabetes. Lifestyle interventions have greater effects on reducing progression to diabetes than metformin or other medications.</p>
<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found that measuring blood glucose is associated with short-term anxiety but not long-term psychological harms. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of lifestyle interventions to reduce the incidence of diabetes are small to none. The harms of drug therapy for the prevention of diabetes are small to moderate, depending on the drug and dosage used.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit to measuring blood glucose to detect IFG, IGT, or diabetes and implementing intensive lifestyle interventions for persons found to have abnormal blood glucose. </p>",Screening for Abnormal Blood Glucose and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,"Diabetes Mellitus (Type 2) and Abnormal Blood Glucose, Screening, 2015"

Treatment of PAD focuses on improving outcomes in symptomatic patients (eg, increasing walking distance and quality of life by improving symptoms of intermittent claudication and leg function, preventing or reducing limb complications, and preserving limb viability). Interventions to prevent CVD events include smoking cessation, lowering cholesterol levels, managing high blood pressure, and antiplatelet therapy. However, because the major risk factors for PAD are also used to calculate CVD risk, patients with a low ABI may already be recommended for these treatments.</p>

"<p>In 2004, the USPSTF recommended against routine screening for bladder cancer in adults because the USPSTF concluded that the harms outweighed the benefits of screening (D recommendation). In 2009, the USPSTF performed a targeted literature review and found insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening for bladder cancer. In 2004, the USPSTF concluded that the harms outweighed the benefits; however, this time the USPSTF reviewed mortality statistics and other epidemiologic data that suggested heretofore undemonstrated benefits of screening. As a result, the USPSTF changed its recommendation from a D to an I statement (insufficient evidence).</p>
<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults. Although adults with mild lower urinary tract symptoms (such as urinary frequency, hesitancy, urgency, dysuria, or nocturia) are not strictly asymptomatic, these symptoms are quite common and are not believed to be associated with an increased risk for bladder cancer. The USPSTF considered it reasonable to include these persons in the population under consideration for screening. Adults with gross hematuria or acute changes in lower urinary tract symptoms are not included in this population.</p>
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
<p>Primary care-feasible screening tests for bladder cancer include identifying hematuria with a urine dipstick or microscopic urinalysis, urine cytology, and tests for urine biomarkers.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Once bladder cancer has been diagnosed, several factors determine treatment, including tumor grade, cancer stage (superficial vs. invasive), whether the tumor is recurrent, the patient's age and overall health status, and patient and physician preferences. The principal treatment for superficial (Ta or T1) bladder cancer is transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, which may be combined with adjuvant radiation therapy, intravesical chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or photodynamic therapies. Radical cystectomy, often with adjuvant or neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy, is used in cases of surgically resectable invasive bladder cancer.</p>
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding I Statement</h3>
<p>In deciding whether to screen for bladder cancer, clinicians should consider the following.</p>
<h4><em>Potential Preventable Burden</em></h4>
<p>Bladder cancer is similar to many other types of cancer in that it is a heterogeneous condition. Approximately 70% of all cases of newly diagnosed transitional cell carcinomas present as superficial tumors (including in situ); some of these tumors may never progress to advanced disease. However, some cases of bladder cancer invade the muscle tissue, progress, and metastasize; treatment has limited efficacy in these cases. Early detection of tumors with malignant potential may have an important effect on the mortality rate of bladder cancer. One challenge of screening for bladder cancer is accurately identifying cases of early-stage cancer (subepithelial and in situ) with a high risk for progression. Another area of uncertainty is determining whether providing earlier, less toxic treatment (such as immunotherapy) with the intention of preventing symptomatic progression results in fewer overall harms to the patient than providing more toxic treatment (such as radical cystectomy) only to those patients who develop symptomatic or advanced tumors. Persons at increased risk for bladder cancer include those who work in the rubber, chemical, or leather industries, as well as those who smoke, are male, are older, or have a family or personal history of bladder cancer.</p>
<h4><em>Potential Harms</em></h4>
<p>False-positive test results may result in anxiety and unneeded evaluations, diagnostic-related harms from cystoscopy and biopsy, harms from labeling or unnecessary treatments (such as transurethral resection of a bladder tumor, intravesical chemotherapy, or biologic therapies), and overdiagnosis.</p>
<h4><em>Current Practice</em></h4>
<p>Screening tests feasible for use in primary care include urine dipstick or microscopic urinalysis for hematuria, urine cytology, and tests for urine biomarkers. Tests for urine biomarkers are not commonly used in primary care in part because of their cost, although this varies substantially. Patients with positive screening results are typically referred to a urologist for further evaluation, which may include cystoscopy (and biopsy if a tumor is found), imaging, and other studies.</p>
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
<p>Several gaps in the evidence led the USPSTF to issue an I statement. Addressing these research needs could potentially provide sufficient evidence for the USPSTF to issue future screening recommendations. Cohort studies are needed to evaluate the natural history of early-stage, untreated bladder cancer (particularly that detected by screening) to allow a greater understanding of the potential overdiagnosis and overtreatment associated with screen-detected bladder cancer. Studies that compare the diagnostic accuracy of urine screening tests in representative populations are needed, as well as studies that assess the effect of screening on the incidence of bladder cancer, tumor characteristics, and subsequent treatments. Randomized, controlled trials or well-designed case-control studies that evaluate clinical outcomes in screened versus unscreened populations, which would provide direct evidence on benefits and harms of screening, have highest priority. Targeting populations at increased risk for bladder cancer because of patient characteristics or occupational exposure may be preferred to enhance feasibility and maximize clinical relevance. A better understanding of the harms related to screening and treatment are required. Methods for evaluating these harms could include conducting observational studies based on patient registries or large pharmacoepidemiologic databases. As noted, prospective cohort studies are needed to more accurately identify cases of early-stage cancer (subepithelial and in situ) with a high risk for progression. Future research should also clarify the trade-offs of using less-toxic treatments earlier and more frequently, to prevent symptomatic progression, versus using treatments with greater toxicity, which are typically reserved for those patients who develop symptomatic or advanced tumors.</p>",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf11/bladdercancer/bladcanrs.htm#clinical,112,"No major organization recommends screening for bladder cancer in asymptomatic adults. In 2011, the American Academy of Family Physicians endorsed the USPSTF recommendation. The European Association of Urology states that the best approach to primary prevention of muscle-invasive bladder cancer is to eliminate active and passive smoking. The American Cancer Society states that prompt attention to bladder symptoms is the best approach for finding bladder cancer in its earliest, most treatable stages in persons with no known risk factors.","Burden of Disease

	The incidence of bladder cancer in the United States is approximately 21 cases per 100,000 persons or 0.02%. It is the seventh-leading cause of death due to solid cancer in the United States. In 2009, an estimated 70,980 new cases of bladder cancer were diagnosed, and approximately 14,330 people died of the disease. In comparison, in 2009 there were an estimated 219,440 new cases of lung cancer and 159,390 deaths, 146,970 new cases of colorectal cancer and 49,920 deaths, 192,280 new cases of prostate cancer and 27,360 deaths, and 11,270 new cases of cervical cancer and 4070 deaths1.

	Bladder cancer is a heterogeneous condition with a variable natural history. It also has a relatively low mortality rate relative to the incidence of new cases. As a result, risk for overdiagnosis and overtreatment is a major issue in bladder cancer screening. Thus, it is important to identify superficial tumors that are at high risk for progression and target treatment at an earlier, more treatable stage in persons with such tumors, while minimizing unnecessary treatments in those unlikely to have disease-specific morbidity or mortality1.

	Persons at increased risk for bladder cancer include those who smoke or have occupational exposure to carcinogens, such as those who work in the rubber, chemical, or leather industries. Other risk factors for bladder cancer include male sex, older age, white race, infections caused by certain bladder parasites, and a family or personal history of bladder cancer1.

	Scope of Review

	To update its 2004 recommendation on screening for bladder cancer in asymptomatic persons2, the USPSTF reviewed the current state of the evidence and identified new evidence that addresses previously identified gaps. The USPSTF reviewed new evidence on the benefits and harms of screening, the accuracy of primary care-feasible screening tests, and the benefits and harms of treatment.

	Accuracy of Screening Tests

	Primary care–feasible screening tests for bladder cancer include urinalysis for hematuria, urinary cytology, and tests for other urine biomarkers. No evidence was found regarding the diagnostic accuracy of screening tests in asymptomatic persons3.

	Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment

	The USPSTF found no direct evidence that bladder cancer screening is associated with improved health outcomes compared with no screening. The USPSTF could not evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for screen-detected bladder cancer because of a lack of studies that compare clinical outcomes associated with treatment versus no treatment3.

	Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment

	The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms associated with bladder cancer screening. In screening studies, the positive predictive value of various tests was less than 10%, which suggests a significant burden of unnecessary follow-up procedures and associated harms3. However, the USPSTF found no reliable data with which to estimate the incremental harms associated with screening for bladder cancer compared with no screening, or the harms associated with treatment of screen-detected bladder cancer versus no treatment.

	Potential harms of screening for bladder cancer include false-positive test results and unnecessary subsequent diagnostic procedures, as well as earlier initiation of routine surveillance. Follow-up of positive screening results typically includes cystoscopy and may include imaging studies. Potential harms include anxiety, labeling, discomfort or pain related to cystoscopy, and complications related to cystoscopy and biopsy (such as perforation, bleeding, or infection) or imaging (such as adverse effects related to the use of intravenous contrast)4-7.

	In lower-prevalence populations, more patients are potentially exposed to unnecessary harms because of a higher rate of false-positive results than in higher-prevalence populations.

	One large, uncontrolled observational study of 2821 patients8 reported bleeding and perforation in 2.8% and 1.3%, respectively, of patients who underwent transurethral resection of a bladder tumor. However, the incremental harms that may have occurred because of screening cannot be estimated from the data. As noted, the risk for overdiagnosis and overtreatment is substantial because of the relatively low mortality rate. Thus, it is important to assess the harms related to overtreating screen-detected bladder cancer that is unlikely to progress to death or disability.

	Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit

	The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of screening tests for bladder cancer. The USPSTF also found inadequate evidence on the effectiveness of treatment and the harms of screening or treatment. Therefore, the USPSTF concluded that the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening is lacking.

	Response to Public Comments

	A draft of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 30 November 2010 to 28 December 2010. Six comments were received from individuals or organizations. All comments were reviewed during the creation of this final document. Specifically, input from clinical specialists led to changes in the description of treatments. In general, the comments supported the USPSTF's specified research agenda.

Incomplete neural tube closure results in defects such as anencephaly and spina bifida. These defects vary in level of disability and may lead to death. Neural tube defects are among the most common major congenital anomalies in the United States.1 Based on 2009–2011 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the estimated average annual prevalence of anencephaly and spina bifida combined was 6.5 cases per 10,000 live births.1, 2
Since widespread recommendations on folic acid supplementation and the implementation of food fortification laws by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1998, prevalence rates of infants born with neural tube defects have decreased.1, 2 Prevalence of neural tube defects declined from 10.7 cases per 10,000 live births before the implementation of food fortification (1995 to 1996) to 7.0 cases per 10,000 live births after fortification (1999 to 2011).2 Folic acid supplementation prevents about 1300 annual births from being affected by neural tube defects, according to recent estimates.2 Although supplementation recommendations and food fortification laws have reduced the prevalence of neural tube defects, it is still difficult for most women to consume the daily requirement of 0.4 mg (400 μg) of folic acid from food alone. The 2007–2012 NHANES found that 48% of respondents of childbearing age reported consuming folic acid from mandatorily fortified foods only. Only 29% of all respondents reported taking a daily folic acid supplement.9 Among women who were taking a daily folic acid supplement, about half (14.6% of all women) were taking a supplement containing less than the daily recommended dose of 0.4 mg (400 µg).1, 9
Scope of Review
In 2009, the USPSTF reviewed the effectiveness of folic acid supplementation in women of childbearing age for the prevention of neural tube defects in infants.7 The current review assessed new evidence on the benefits and harms of folic acid supplementation. The USPSTF did not review the evidence on folic acid supplementation in women with a history of pregnancy affected by neural tube defects or other high-risk factors. Evidence on folic acid fortification, counseling to increase dietary intake of folic acid or naturally occurring food folate, or screening for neural tube defects is also outside the scope of this review.
Effectiveness of Preventive Medication
In 2009, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence on folic acid supplementation in women of childbearing age and found that the benefits are well-established and outweigh the harms.8
In the current review, the USPSTF evaluated 1 randomized clinical trial (RCT), 2 cohort studies, 8 case-control studies, and 2 publications from the previous USPSTF review for evidence of effectiveness of folic acid supplementation (n = at least 41,802 participants). Results were not pooled because of study heterogeneity and differences in food fortification over time.
A fair-quality RCT conducted in Hungary (1984–1992) assessed women (n = 5453) without a personal history of pregnancy affected by neural tube defects.1, 15 Participants were randomized to receive either a daily vitamin supplement containing 0.8 mg (800 μg) of folic acid (experimental group) or a daily trace-element supplement (control group) in the periconceptional period. The trial reported no cases of neural tube defects in the experimental group and 6 cases in the control group (0% vs 0.25%; P = 0.014 by Fisher exact test).15 These results indicate a statistically significant lower odds of neural tube defects with folic acid supplementation (Peto odds ratio [OR], 0.131 [95% CI, 0.0263 to 0.648]; P = 0.013).1, 15
Evidence from older, fair-quality observational studies provide additional support that folic acid supplementation is beneficial.1, 5 A fair-quality prospective cohort study (n = 6112) conducted in Hungary compared women who were provided a vitamin supplement containing 0.8 mg (800 μg) of folic acid before conception with unsupplemented women at the first prenatal visit (between 8 and 12 weeks of pregnancy) and showed a statistically significant effect on the odds of neural tube defects (OR, 0.11 [95% CI, 0.01 to 0.91]).1, 16. A fair-quality retrospective cohort study conducted in the United States in women undergoing ɑ-fetoprotein testing or amniocentesis between 15 and 20 weeks of pregnancy showed a statistically significant effect on the odds of neural tube defects among 10,713 women who took multivitamins containing folic acid in weeks 1 through 6 of pregnancy compared with 3157 women who did not take any supplements (OR, 0.27 [95% CI, 0.11 to 0.63]).1, 17
The 8 remaining studies were fair-quality case-control studies of births occurring over 3 decades, from 1976 through 2008.1 Studies compared infants who had malformations caused by neural tube defects to either nonmalformed infants or infants who had malformations not caused by neural tube defects. Data were drawn from 2 multistate studies (National Birth Defects Prevention Study and the Slone Epidemiology Center Birth Defects Study), a 2-state study (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neural Tube Defects Study), and 2 single-state studies (Texas Neural Tube Defect Project and the California Birth Defects Monitoring Program).1 Older case-control studies conducted before implementation of food fortification laws were generally consistent with the more recent evidence showing that folic acid supplementation is beneficial for the prevention of neural tube defects (OR range, 0.6 to 0.7 [in 3 of 4 studies]). Newer case-control studies conducted after food fortification did not show a protective effect of folic acid supplementation on neural tube defects (OR range, 0.93 to 1.40 [95% CI included the null]).1
Ethical considerations limited the use of RCT methods to study the effects of folic acid supplementation after food fortification. The newer studies are more subject to design issues than the older ones, which had fewer design flaws.1 Case-control studies have the potential for selection and recall bias, both of which can reduce the observed effect of folic acid supplementation on neural tube defects. Another issue with all study designs is the relative rarity of the outcome and the challenge of adequately powering studies to determine benefits. Another potential explanation for the findings is that the majority of cases of neural tube defects due to folate deficiency have now been prevented, and subsequent cases result from a different etiology. Despite this possible rationale, evidence indicates that most women are not consuming fortified foods at the level needed for optimal benefit. Inadequate folate intake continues to leave nearly one-fourth of the US population with suboptimal red blood cell folate concentration.1, 9
Three fair-quality case-control studies (n = 11,154) examined the effects of folic acid supplementation by race/ethnicity.1, 18-20 One study found that folic acid supplementation may be less protective among Hispanic women compared with white or black women.18 A second study found a statistically nonsignificant increased risk of neural tube defects with supplementation among Hispanic women (OR adjusted for consistent users vs nonusers, 2.20 [95% CI, 0.98 to 4.92]).19. A third study found that periconceptional supplementation did not decrease the risk of neural tube defects and reported no differences in effect by race/ethnicity.20 These inconsistent results among Hispanic women could be a result of chance due to small sample sizes.
Eight fair-quality case-control studies addressed dose, timing, or duration of therapy.1 Of these 8 studies, 4 (n = 26,791) provided information on dose, 5 (n = 26,808) provided information on timing, and none provided information on duration. Across the studies, evidence was inconsistent that the benefits of folic acid supplementation differ by dosage or timing.1
Potential Harms of Preventive Medication
The USPSTF found adequate evidence that folic acid supplementation does not have serious harms. One fair-quality trial and 1 fair-quality cohort study did not find evidence of a statistically significant increased risk of pregnancy with twins in women.1
In the Hungarian trial (n = 5453), the rate of twin pregnancy was not statistically significantly different between the multivitamin and trace-element groups (OR, 1.4 [95% CI, 0.97 to 2.25]).1, 21 In a retrospective, population-based cohort study in Norway (n = 176,042), no association was found between folic acid supplementation and twin pregnancy (OR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.89 to 2.21]) after adjusting for use of in vitro fertilization, maternal age, and parity.22
The Hungarian trial examined adverse events in women and found a potential increased risk of maternal weight gain, diarrhea, and constipation at 12 weeks of pregnancy. However, there was a low event rate, and these symptoms could have occurred by chance. These symptoms are also associated with pregnancy.1, 15
Three systematic reviews of observational studies (n = at least 14,438 participants) evaluated childhood asthma, wheezing, or allergies and found inconsistent evidence of harms.1, 23, 24 Evidence was also inconsistent on the harms of folic acid supplementation differing by dosage and timing. No evidence was found on harms differing by duration of therapy.1.
Other potential hypothesized harms of folic acid supplementation include the masking of symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency and subsequent neurologic complications, carcinogenic effects, asthma/allergic reactions, and interactions with medications.1, 7, 10 The USPSTF found no significant evidence of these potential harms.
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF found no new substantial evidence on the benefits and harms of folic acid supplementation that would lead to a change in its recommendation from 2009.7 The USPSTF assessed the balance of the benefits and harms of folic acid supplementation in women of childbearing age and determined that the net benefit is substantial. Evidence is adequate that the harms to the mother or infant from folic acid supplementation taken at the usual doses are no greater than small. Therefore, the USPSTF reaffirms its 2009 recommendation that all women who are planning or capable of pregnancy take a daily supplement containing 0.4 to 0.8 mg (400 to 800 µg) of folic acid.8
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
Genetic predisposition and environmental influences are thought to contribute to neural tube defects. These environmental influences are being investigated. An important environmental influence is the consumption of folate. The mechanism of action of folate in the prevention of neural tube defects is unknown. Folate acts as a coenzyme in the synthesis of nucleic acids and the metabolism of amino acids. An important function of folate is its role in single-carbon transfers, which are important in methylation reactions and in purine and pyrimidine synthesis. Folate is necessary for the regulation of DNA synthesis and function; reduced concentrations of folate may limit the number of methyl groups available for DNA replication and methylation.1, 7, 10
Evidence suggests that mutation in the MTHFR gene, which encodes the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, is a risk factor for neural tube defects. This enzyme regulates folate and homocysteine levels. Persons who have this gene mutation have decreased folate levels, which reduces the conversion of homocysteine to methionine and may increase the risk of neural tube defects.1, 25 Folic acid consumption may help diminish the effects of the gene mutation.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from May 10 to June 6, 2016. Some comments requested a more detailed definition of “excessive” folic acid. In response, the USPSTF added information about tolerable upper intake levels for folic acid. Other comments suggested emphasizing that many women do not meet daily recommended amounts of folic acid and adding language on the potential harms of folic acid supplementation. The USPSTF added language about the harms of supplementation and the difficulty of consuming enough folic acid from food alone.","<h3 style=""padding: 1em 0em 0.2em; margin: 0em; color: #222222; font-size: 1.2em; font-style: oblique; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">mportance</h3>

"<h3><strong><a id=""clinical"" name=""clinical""></a></strong>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic persons without a history of skin cancer. Because most trials of skin cancer counseling predominantly include persons with fair skin types, the USPSTF limited its recommendation to this population.</p>
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
<p>Persons with fair skin types (ivory or pale skin, light eye color, red or blond hair, freckles, those who sunburn easily) are at increased risk of skin cancer and should be counseled. Other factors that further increase risk include a history of sunburns, previous use of indoor tanning beds, and a family or personal history of skin cancer. Persons with an increased number of nevi and atypical nevi are at increased risk of melanoma. Persons with a compromised immune system (eg, persons living with HIV, persons who have received an organ transplant) are at increased risk of skin cancer.</p>
<h3>Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>
<p>All studies conducted in children and adolescents focused on sun protection behaviors; most were directed at parents, and some provided child-specific materials or messages. Half of the interventions included face-to-face counseling, and all included print materials. Three studies provided the intervention in conjunction with well-child visits. The majority of studies conducted in young adults and adults focused on improving sun protection behaviors, and 2 studies used &ldquo;appearance-focused&rdquo; messages. The mode of delivery varied and included mail-based, face-to-face or telephone counseling, and technology-based (text messages, online programs and modules, personal UV facial photographs) interventions.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation2""><span style=""font-size: small;"">2</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
<p>Counseling adults about performing skin self-examination appears to result in an increase of such examinations. The potential benefit of behavioral counseling about skin self-examination is uncertain because of the lack of evidence on the link between behavior change and skin cancer or other health outcomes. In addition, there is no evidence about the incremental benefit that might occur with skin self-examination above the benefit from counseling for skin protective behaviors and from current levels of skin examinations being performed by clinicians.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
<p>Skin self-examination is performed by the patient and is noninvasive. Psychosocial harms, such as anxiety or cancer worry, are possible. If skin self-examination leads to biopsy, procedural harms such as pain, bleeding, scarring, or infection could occur.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation7""><span style=""font-size: small;"">7</span></a></sup></p>
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
<p>The frequency of behavioral counseling for skin self-examination in the asymptomatic population is not well known.</p>
<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>
<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends child care center&ndash;based, primary and middle school&ndash;based, and multicomponent community-wide interventions for the prevention of skin cancer.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation8""><span style=""font-size: small;"">8</span></a></sup> These interventions combine school- and community-based communications and policy to increase preventive behaviors (eg, covering up, using shade, or avoiding the sun during peak UV hours) among certain populations in specific settings.</p>
<p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provides information to help guide patients and clinicians regarding sun protection and the use and effectiveness of broad-spectrum sunscreen.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation9""><span style=""font-size: small;"">9</span></a></sup> The FDA has determined that broad-spectrum sunscreens with a sun-protection factor of 15 or greater, reapplied at least every 2 hours, protect against both UVA and UVB radiation and reduce the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging. The FDA also provides consumer education materials on the dangers of indoor tanning.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation10""><span style=""font-size: small;"">10</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency provides a variety of educational tools regarding sun safety, including state-specific information, and interactive widgets and smartphone applications that forecast UV exposure by zip code or city. It also provides sun safety fact sheets and handouts, including age-appropriate materials.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation11""><span style=""font-size: small;"">11</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
<p>The USPSTF has issued a recommendation on screening for skin cancer in adults.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation12""><span style=""font-size: small;"">12</span></a></sup></p>",,190,"<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Interventions included tailored mailings, print materials, and in-person counseling by health professionals. Interventions for children were directed mostly toward parents; some materials were child-specific. Counseling interventions for children, their parents, or both provided messages focused on increasing sun protection behaviors (eg, using sunscreen, avoiding midday sun, wearing sun-protective clothing). Some print-based interventions included materials tailored to the child&rsquo;s risk level, barriers to change, self-efficacy, or other factors. Health professionals providing in-person counseling included primary care clinicians and health educators.</p>
<p>One trial of an intervention involving children 3 years and younger used clinician counseling and print materials for parents promoting child sun protection with sun protection aids (sunscreen samples and hat).<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation13""><span style=""font-size: small;"">13</span></a></sup> Several trials in children aged 3 to 10 years used standard or tailored mailings over 1 to 36 months.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation14""><span style=""font-size: small;"">14-17</span></a></sup> One study also included a DVD in addition to a standard mailing promoting sun protection. One trial used a 1-day, in-person parent education session with a children's video, print materials, and sun protection aids (shirt, hat, and sunscreen). For the single study in adolescents, clinicians directly counseled participants, with 4 follow-up telephone counseling sessions by a health educator over 18 months; mailed materials and sunscreen samples were also used.</p>
<p>In the 16 trials among adults, interventions included a variety of messages and components, conducted in a range of settings.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation2""><span style=""font-size: small;"">2</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation4"">4</a></sup></span> Technology-based interventions included an interactive web program and tailored text messages on sun protection, as well as appearance-focused print materials. The web program study reported reduced sunburns after the intervention, which provided information on topics such as indoor tanning, UV radiation exposure and health, skin cancer, sunscreen, and skin examination. Each module took about 10 minutes to complete and included a goal-setting section. Other interventions that increased sun protection behaviors in adults included mailed print materials containing personalized risk feedback and recommendations, self-monitoring aids for UV exposure, and skin cancer prevention and detection information; individualized computer reports; and an interactive educational computer program on skin cancer prevention that provided individual feedback on personal risk of skin cancer.</p>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
<p>A better understanding of the effectiveness of counseling on the use of sun protection behaviors in adults 25 years and older is needed to address the key evidence gap on counseling for this age group. Research that evaluates the association between UV exposure during adulthood and skin cancer risk would also be valuable.</p>
<p>In addition, studies regarding the effectiveness of counseling persons without a fair skin type are lacking. Ideally, research studies would provide measurements of sun exposure, sunburn, precursor skin lesions, and cancer among large trial populations, with an emphasis on behaviors and health outcomes among persons who receive an intervention focused on sun protection behaviors. Such studies would also assess whether these behaviors continue after trial completion. These cohorts should include populations with diverse skin colors and should include adolescents, young adults, and preschool-aged children and their parents. These studies may be used to further develop technologies and vehicles for administering relevant interventions for behavior change in the primary care setting, especially among nonwhite persons, young adults, and persons who practice indoor or outdoor tanning. Further evidence is needed to assess the balance of benefits and harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cancer and premature death.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This recommendation replaces the 2012 USPSTF recommendation on counseling about skin cancer prevention<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation19""><span style=""font-size: small;"">19</span></a></sup> and the skin self-examination portion of the 2009 USPSTF recommendation on screening for skin cancer.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation20""><span style=""font-size: small;"">20</span></a></sup> In this updated recommendation, the USPSTF expanded the age range for behavioral counseling interventions to include persons aged 6 months to 24 years with fair skin types (the previous recommendation applied to persons aged 10 to 24 years, based on the evidence available at that time). Recent studies in children younger than 10 years resulted in the USPSTF extending the lower end of the age range to 6 months, the minimum age recommended for sunscreen use. Based on additional evidence since the prior recommendation, the USPSTF now also recommends that clinicians consider selectively offering counseling to adults older than 24 years with fair skin types. As in 2012, the evidence on persons without a fair skin type remains insufficient for this population to be included in the recommendation statement. The evidence continues to be insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cancer, as it was in 2009.</p>","Burden of Disease
Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer. Melanoma is less common than basal or squamous cell carcinoma but has a much higher death rate. In 2018, an estimated 91,270 new cases of melanoma are expected, representing 5.2% of all new cancer cases.1 An estimated 9730 persons will die of the disease, representing 1.6% of all cancer deaths.18 Although age-adjusted incidence rates have increased from 1989 to 2014 (from 13.7 to 25.2 cases per 100,000 persons), the death rate has remained fairly stable over the same period (from 2.7 to 2.6 deaths per 100,000 persons).18 Adults older than 50 years; men; and persons with fair skin types are at increased risk. Melanoma is most frequently diagnosed among adults aged 65 to 74 years; death rates are highest among the middle-aged and elderly. Melanoma is 5 times more common among Hispanic adults and 25 times more common among white than African American adults.18
Nonmelanoma skin cancer, of which most cases are basal and squamous cell skin cancer, is associated with a substantial burden to the patient but rarely results in death. Basal cell skin cancer constitutes about 80% of nonmelanoma skin cancer cases, and squamous cell skin cancer constitutes about 20%.6 In general, nonmelanoma skin cancer accounts for a small percentage of all cancer deaths, mostly in older adults or persons with a compromised immune system. An estimated 2000 persons die from nonmelanoma skin cancer each year.6 The true prevalence of nonmelanoma skin cancer is difficult to estimate because it is not a required cancer for registry entry; an estimated 5.4 million cases were diagnosed in 3.3 million persons in 2012.6
Scope of Review
The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to update its 2012 recommendation on behavioral counseling for the primary prevention of skin cancer19 and its 2009 recommendation on screening for skin cancer with skin self-examination.20 The review2, 4 focused on direct evidence that counseling patients about sun protection reduces intermediate outcomes (eg, sunburn or precursor skin lesions) or skin cancer. The review also sought evidence on the link between counseling and behavior change, the link between behavior change and skin cancer incidence, and the harms of counseling or changes in sun protection behavior. In addition, the review examined evidence regarding counseling patients to perform skin self-examination and skin cancer outcomes and the harms of skin self-examination.
Effectiveness of Behavioral Counseling Interventions to Change Behavior
Many counseling interventions were found to be moderately effective in modifying sun protection behaviors among children, adolescents, and young adults but less effective in adults. Both traditional cancer prevention and appearance-focused messages (ie, stressing the aging effects of UV radiation on the skin) increased sun protection behaviors compared with control groups.
Of the 6 trials that evaluated the effect of interventions on sun protection behaviors among children and adolescents, 5 reported a statistically significant improvement in parent-reported composite scores of child sun protection behaviors compared with control groups.13, 15, 17, 21, 22 Four of the 6 trials specifically targeted children aged 3 to 10 years, 1 trial focused on children from birth to 3 years, and 1 trial focused on adolescents aged 11 to 15 years. Among the 4 trials in children aged 3 to 10 years, 3 showed statistically significant differences in changes in sun protection behavior and sunscreen use at 3 months to 3 years of follow-up.14-16
A cluster randomized clinical trial13 that provided counseling to parents of newborns in a series of 4 well-child visits showed statistically significant improvement in composite sun protection scores in the intervention group. However, most individual measures were not statistically significant, and it was difficult to determine the clinical relevance of the small improvements. An in-person counseling intervention targeting adolescents and involving clinicians and health educators showed that sun protection scores were higher in the intervention group than in the control group at 2 years of follow-up.21
Adequate evidence of the effectiveness of counseling interventions was found in 2 of the 3 fair-quality trials conducted among young adults. In a web-based study of 18- to 25-year olds, participants viewed an interactive 12-module web program featuring 10-minute topics such as indoor tanning, UV exposure and health, skin cancer, and skin examination.22 At 3 months of follow-up, there was a significant improvement in past-month UV exposure and sun protection behaviors, sunscreen use, outdoor tanning, and skin self-examination. Another study (a randomized clinical trial) used a video intervention, with or without UV facial photography; the intervention showed no effect on composite sun protection scores.23 In the third young adult study, women who used indoor tanning were given a 24-page booklet that detailed the effects of UV radiation and indoor tanning and appearance-enhancing alternatives to indoor tanning. At 6 months of follow-up, there was a significantly smaller increase in indoor tanning sessions in the past 3 months in the intervention group than in the control group.24
Evidence of the effectiveness of counseling interventions in adults older than 24 years is mixed. Six of 12 trials that addressed sun protection behavior composite scores in adults found an increase in such behaviors compared with control groups.2, 4 Three of these interventions promoted sun protection with tailored mailings, 2 used interactive online programs, and 1 used tailored text messages. Four of 7 trials assessing sunscreen use found an increase in this outcome. Of 3 trials of self-reported indoor tanning behavior, only 1 trial using an appearance-focused intervention among young female adults noted a significant improvement compared with the control group.24 Effective interventions were more often of longer duration or had more frequent contacts with participants during the study period.
Trials of counseling interventions that focused on counseling patients to perform skin self-examination as a means of reducing skin cancer risk were inconclusive. A trial with more than 1300 participants showed that those who received a skin self-examination counseling intervention did not have significant differences in the incidence of skin cancer cases or atypical nevi compared with those in the control group at 12 months of follow-up.25 Several studies showed that skin self-examination interventions increase the likelihood of participants reporting that they perform skin self-examination.2, 4 Additional studies are needed to determine the direct effect of skin self-examination on skin cancer risk.
Link Between Behavior Change and Cancer Risk
Sun Exposure
Total and recreational sun exposure during childhood is associated with increased melanoma risk. Studies that measured long-term or total sun exposure showed mixed association between increased sun exposure and skin cancer risk. Several fair- to good-quality studies demonstrated a link between adult recreational exposure to UV radiation and increased melanoma risk.3 One large population-based study showed increased risk of both melanoma incidence and melanoma death with higher quartiles of UV exposure.26 Two recent meta-analyses and 2 cohort studies also showed an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer in persons with increased exposure to ambient UV radiation.2
Indoor Tanning
Indoor tanning is associated with increased melanoma risk, and younger age at first indoor tanning exposure increases this risk.27 A meta-analysis provided evidence of a dose-response relationship between melanoma risk and indoor tanning in women younger than 50 years.28 Four studies found that increasing indoor tanning frequency was associated with increased melanoma risk. Two systematic reviews, 1 cohort study, and 1 case-control study found evidence that having ever used indoor tanning was associated with increased risk of squamous cell and basal cell carcinoma compared with never having used indoor tanning.29-32
Sunscreen Use
Two studies in adults provided new evidence of a protective effect of sunscreen use. One study, which was considered by the USPSTF for its previous recommendation statement, analyzed long-term follow-up data from a randomized clinical trial. In this study, intervention group participants applied sunscreen daily, while control group participants continued their usual behavior. At 4.5 years, the intervention group had a decreased risk of squamous cell carcinoma.33 Ten years after conclusion of the trial, the intervention group had half as many incident melanomas as the control group. Overall, melanoma risk was reduced in the intervention group compared with the control group and was most pronounced for invasive melanoma compared with in situ melanoma.34 A large US case-control study also demonstrated a lower likelihood of melanoma in persons routinely using sunscreen compared with those who do not.29
Skin Self-Examination and Health Outcomes
Evidence on the effectiveness of skin self-examination in reducing death or illness is lacking. One 20-year follow-up study showed no association between skin self-examination and skin cancer death.35
Potential Harms of Behavioral Counseling Interventions
Potential harms of interventions promoting sun protection behaviors include skin reactions to sunscreen lotion, vitamin D deficiency, reduced physical activity due to avoiding the outdoors, and a paradoxical increase in sun exposure from a false reassurance of protection from sunscreen use. Sunscreen use can be associated with numerous transient skin reactions, including allergic, irritant, and photoallergic contact dermatitis. Although vitamin D deficiency is a hypothetical harm of sun avoidance, recent studies have not shown an association between sunscreen use and decreased vitamin D levels. Among the sparse evidence available, 1 study suggested that sun protection behaviors do not lead to decreased physical activity or increased body mass index.36 Older studies reported that sunscreen use did not result in an intentional increase in sun exposure, but 2 recent studies showed that sunscreen use was associated with higher likelihood of multiple sunburns.37, 38
Persons who performed skin self-examination were more likely to subsequently undergo a skin procedure compared with those who did not, as evidenced by 1 trial, indicating a potential harm of skin self-examination. Although melanoma death rates have remained stable, the increasing number of skin biopsies and rising melanoma incidence over recent decades provide evidence for overdiagnosis.39
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF determined that behavioral counseling interventions are of moderate benefit in increasing sun protection behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults with fair skin types. The link of behavior change to outcomes is supported by several trials and a substantial body of observational evidence showing that the strongest connection between UV radiation exposure and skin cancer stems from exposure in childhood and adolescence. Evidence of a connection between sun exposure in adulthood and melanoma is less robust than in childhood. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms related to counseling or sun protection behaviors are small. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of counseling to decrease UV exposure and reduce skin cancer risk is moderate in children, adolescents, and young adults aged 6 months to 24 years.
The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavioral counseling interventions result in a small increase in sun protection behaviors in adults older than 24 years. The harms of counseling are small. The USPSTF determined that the evidence supporting a link between decreased UV exposure in adulthood and skin cancer risk is adequate. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of counseling to decrease UV exposure and reduce skin cancer risk is small in adults older than 24 years.
The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits and harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cancer. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cancer.
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
UV radiation from both solar and artificial sources has been classified as a human carcinogen by national and international organizations. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that the effect of UV radiation exposure from typical doses of sunlight varies over the life span, with some evidence of a window of biological vulnerability in childhood and adolescence that translates into increased skin cancer risk later in life. Much of the available evidence concerns the most common skin lesions, nonmalignant neoplasia and basal cell and squamous cell cancer. It remains unclear whether the same mechanisms apply to melanoma risk. For all 3 types of cancer, increasing intermittent or recreational sun exposure and total sun exposure are linked to increased risk. Artificial UV radiation, specifically indoor tanning, is also associated with an increased risk of skin cancer. Indoor tanning before age 35 years, for more than 10 tanning sessions over a lifetime, and for longer than 1 year have been linked to increased cancer risk.
Response to Public Comments
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from October 10 to November 6, 2017. In response to public comments, the USPSTF clarified the definition of fair skin type for the purposes of this recommendation. Comments requested more details about the behavioral counseling interventions, and the USPSTF provided additional information on implementation strategies. Several comments requested clarification about why skin self-examination is included in this recommendation; the USPSTF clarified that this recommendation addresses several preventive counseling interventions, including evidence about primary care clinicians counseling patients to perform skin self-examination. The USPSTF also added suggestions for practice regarding the I statement, information on newer technologies, and further information on the evidence for the different age ranges in the recommendations.","<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the United States and is generally categorized as melanoma or nonmelanoma skin cancer. Melanoma is the fifth-leading type of incident cancer, and 2.2% of adults will be diagnosed with it in their lifetime.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup> Although invasive melanoma accounts for 2% of all skin cancer cases, it is responsible for 80% of skin cancer deaths.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup> Basal and squamous cell carcinoma, the 2 predominant types of nonmelanoma skin cancer, represent the vast majority of skin cancer cases. There were an estimated 3.3 million new cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer in 2012 and an estimated 91,270 new cases of melanoma skin cancer in 2018.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Recognition of Risk Status</h3>
<p>Exposure to UV radiation during childhood and adolescence increases the risk of skin cancer later in life, especially when more severe damage occurs, such as with severe sunburns. Persons with fair skin types (ivory or pale skin, light hair and eye color, freckles, or those who sunburn easily) are at increased risk of skin cancer. Persons who use tanning beds and those with a history of sunburns or previous skin cancer are also at substantially increased risk of skin cancer. Other factors that further increase risk include an increased number of nevi (moles) and atypical nevi, family history of skin cancer, HIV infection, and history of receiving an organ transplant. Most studies of interventions to increase sun protection behaviors have been limited to persons with fair skin types.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation2""><span style=""font-size: small;"">2-4</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Benefits of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>
<p>Behavioral counseling interventions target sun protection behaviors to reduce UV radiation exposure. UV radiation is a known carcinogen<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation5""><span style=""font-size: small;"">5</span></a></sup> that damages DNA and causes most skin cancer cases.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation6""><span style=""font-size: small;"">6</span></a></sup> A substantial body of observational evidence demonstrates that the strongest connection between UV radiation exposure and skin cancer results from exposure in childhood and adolescence. Sun protection behaviors include the use of broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun-protection factor of 15 or greater; wearing hats, sunglasses, or sun-protective clothing; avoiding sun exposure; seeking shade during midday hours (10 am to 4 pm); and avoiding indoor tanning bed use.</p>

"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
<p>This recommendation applies to adult men in the general US population without symptoms or a previous diagnosis of prostate cancer. It also applies to men at increased risk of death from prostate cancer because of race/ethnicity or family history of prostate cancer. The sections below provide more information on how this recommendation applies to African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer.</p>
<h3>Risk Assessment</h3>
<p>Older age, African American race, and family history of prostate cancer are the most important risk factors for the development of prostate cancer. Other factors with weaker associations and less evidence include diets high in fat and low in vegetable consumption. Cigarette smoking is associated with higher risk of prostate cancer mortality.</p>
<h3>Screening</h3>
<p>PSA-based screening is the usual method of screening and has been studied in several large trials. Although new screening methods are being developed (such as single- and adjusted-threshold testing and PSA velocity and doubling time), evidence is insufficient to support one method of PSA-based screening over another. Evidence is also insufficient that using a prebiopsy risk calculator, with or without measurement of free PSA levels, or using genetic or adjunctive imaging tests meaningfully changes the potential benefits and harms of screening. This is an important area of current research that has the potential to decrease the harms of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer. The use of digital rectal examination as a screening modality is not recommended because there is a lack of evidence on the benefits; digital rectal examination was either eliminated from or not included in the major screening trials.</p>
<p>PSA-based screening for prostate cancer has been studied in 3 very large RCTs, each with at least a decade of median follow-up: the US-based Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC), and the Cluster Randomized Trial of PSA Testing for Prostate Cancer (CAP). These trials used varying screening intervals (from 1-time screening to every 1 to 4 years) and PSA thresholds (2.5 to 10.0 ng/mL) for diagnostic biopsy.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation3""><span style=""font-size: small;"">3</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The PLCO trial may be viewed as a trial of organized vs opportunistic screening for prostate cancer because of the substantial screening rate in the control group and the high screening rate among men in both the control and intervention groups prior to study enrollment.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation6""><span style=""font-size: small;"">6</span></a></sup> Men in the intervention group were screened more often than men in the control group, and more men in the intervention group were diagnosed with prostate cancer than in the control group. The trial found no difference between groups in death from prostate cancer after almost 15 years of follow-up (absolute risk, 4.8 per 1000 person-years in the intervention group vs 4.6 per 1000 person-years in the control group; relative risk [RR], 1.04 [95% CI, 0.87-1.24]).<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation7""><span style=""font-size: small;"">7</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In the ERSPC trial, the results suggest that, overall, the number needed to screen is 781 men aged 55 to 69 years at enrollment (95% CI, 490-1929) to prevent 1 man from dying of prostate cancer after 13 years. The results varied across the individual ERSPC sites, and prostate cancer mortality was significantly reduced only at the sites in the Netherlands and Sweden. However, point estimates were in favor of screening at all sites except Switzerland. At the largest site (Finland), there was no significant benefit observed for prostate cancer mortality (rate ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.75-1.10]), and in Sweden there was an absolute risk reduction of 0.72% (95% CI, 0.50%-0.94%), a 42% relative reduction.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation8""><span style=""font-size: small;"">8-10</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Four ERSPC trial sites reported data on the effect of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer on the development of metastatic cancer after 12 years of follow-up. The risk of developing metastatic prostate cancer was 30% lower among men randomized to screening than among men in the control group (absolute risk, 7.05 per 1000 men in the screening group vs 10.14 per 1000 men in the control group [calculated from numbers in the study]). This translates to an absolute reduction in the long-term risk of metastatic prostate cancer of 3.1 cases per 1000 men screened.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation11""><span style=""font-size: small;"">11</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The CAP trial was a cluster-randomized trial of a single invitation to PSA-based screening in the United Kingdom among 415,357 men. Overall, 34% of invited men received a valid PSA screening test. After a median follow-up of 10 years, there was no significant difference in prostate cancer mortality between the invited group and the control group (absolute risk, 0.30 per 1000 person-years vs 0.31 per 1000 person-years, respectively).<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation12""><span style=""font-size: small;"">12</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Based on clinical stage, tumor grade, and PSA level, prostate cancer is classified as low, medium, or high risk for clinical progression and prostate cancer death. Although treatment is thought to be most immediately beneficial for men with high- and medium-risk prostate cancer, the vast majority of cases of screen-detected cancer are low risk.</p>
<p>As with all screening tests, some men without prostate cancer will receive positive PSA test results (ie, &ldquo;false-positive&rdquo; results). The false-positive rate for the PSA test depends on the PSA threshold used. Among 5 ERSPC sites that reported the false-positive rate, approximately 1 in 6 men screened at least once had 1 or more false-positive results, and of the positive results in the first round of screening, two-thirds were false positives. In Sweden, where a low PSA threshold (3.0 ng/mL) was used to determine a positive test result and men were screened every 2 years, more than 45% of men who participated in all screening rounds had a false-positive result over 10 years of screening.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation5""><span style=""font-size: small;"">5</span></a></sup> In the PLCO trial, more than two-thirds of men who underwent a prostate biopsy because of a positive PSA test result were found not to have prostate cancer.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation13""><span style=""font-size: small;"">13</span></a></sup> In addition to false-positive results, there are other harms associated with screening and subsequent diagnostic evaluation; biopsies may result in pain, fever, hematospermia, and hospitalization.</p>
<p>The 3 large RCTs on screening predominantly included men aged 55 to 69 years. There is inadequate evidence on starting screening at a younger age in the average-risk population or to obtain a baseline PSA level. Evidence in men 70 years and older does not support routine screening because of the lack of trial evidence of benefit, the low likelihood of benefit given the time to realize benefit, and the increased risk of harms from false-positive results, biopsies, overdiagnosis, and treatment. Although the evidence does not support routine screening in all men older than 70 years, the USPSTF recognizes the common use of PSA-based screening in practice today and understands that some older men will continue to request screening and some clinicians will continue to offer it. Men older than 70 years who request screening should be aware of the reduced likelihood of benefit from screening and the increased risk of false-positive test results and complications of diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>The USPSTF considered whether there are screening and follow-up approaches that increase the potential for benefit while reducing the potential for harms. Variation across sites in randomized trials of screening suggests there may be greater mortality benefit from screening every other year compared with longer intervals and from using lower PSA thresholds for diagnostic biopsy. Although these approaches may have increased the potential benefit reported in studies, they also resulted in substantially more harms&mdash;more false-positive results, more prostate biopsies, and more cases of overdiagnosis. This trade-off was also observed in a review of decision analysis models; screening protocols using lower PSA thresholds (<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation14""><span style=""font-size: small;"">14</span></a> The frequency of screening in the ERSCP sites ranged from every 2 to 7 years. No ERSPC trial site offered screening more often than every 2 years, and many sites screened every 4 years. The PSA threshold for biopsy in the ERSCP sites ranged from 2.5 to 4 ng/mL (except for 10 ng/mL in the earlier years at the Belgium site). In the G&ouml;teborg, Sweden, site, which reported the largest benefit, the frequency of screening was every 2 years, and the threshold for biopsy was 2.5 ng/mL (3.0 ng/mL in the first few years of the study).</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>The potential benefit of screening for prostate cancer is because of treatment. Thus, it is important for men to consider both the potential benefits and harms of treatment (including active surveillance) as they consider whether to be screened. Men not able or willing to tolerate treatment should not be screened for prostate cancer. Because most cases of prostate cancer advance very slowly, if at all, the 10-year survival rate for screen-detected, localized prostate cancer is very high. In a recent major trial that enrolled more than 1500 men randomized to receive either active treatment or active surveillance, the 10-year survival rate in all groups was 99%.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation15""><span style=""font-size: small;"">15</span></a></sup> The good prognosis for early-stage prostate cancer makes it difficult to study the effectiveness of treatment.</p>
<p>Multiple treatment options exist for prostate cancer, and new ones are being developed. In current practice, the 3 most common treatment options for men with screen-detected, localized prostate cancer are surgical removal of the prostate gland (radical prostatectomy), radiation therapy (external-beam radiation therapy, proton beam therapy, or brachytherapy), and active surveillance. The USPSTF considered available evidence on treatment when evaluating the effectiveness of screening and found that current evidence suggests that treatment of early-stage, screen-detected prostate cancer with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy likely reduces risk of clinical progression and metastatic disease and may reduce prostate cancer mortality. More details about the effectiveness and adverse effects of active treatment are provided in the Discussion section.</p>
<p>Active surveillance is a treatment approach that seeks to limit the harms of treatment by allowing men with apparent low-risk prostate cancer to forego surgery or radiation in favor of ongoing monitoring of their cancer. Although protocols vary, active surveillance usually includes regular, repeated PSA testing and often repeated digital rectal examination and prostate biopsy, with potential for exposure to repeated harms from biopsies. Men whose cancer is found to be changing are offered definitive treatment with surgery or radiation therapy. Other treatment monitoring strategies for men with low-risk cancer exist (for example, watchful waiting) and also vary in protocol. Active surveillance has become a more common treatment choice in the United States over the past several years. In a study assessing community-based urology practice in the United States between 2010 and 2013, about half of men with low-risk prostate cancer were treated with radical prostatectomy. The active surveillance rate, however, increased from about 10% in 2005-2009 to 40.4% in 2010-2013 among men with low-risk prostate cancer.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation16""><span style=""font-size: small;"">16</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Active treatment of prostate cancer can result in major adverse effects. About 3 in 1000 men die during or soon after radical prostatectomy, and about 50 in 1000 men have serious surgical complications requiring intervention. About 1 in 5 men who undergo radical prostatectomy develop long-term urinary incontinence requiring regular use of pads, and about 2 in 3 men experience long-term erectile dysfunction. More than half of men who receive radiation therapy experience long-term erectile dysfunction, and up to 1 in 6 men experience long-term bothersome bowel symptoms, including bowel urgency and fecal incontinence.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation3""><span style=""font-size: small;"">3</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Screening for Prostate Cancer in African American Men</h3>
<h4>Burden</h4>
<p>In the United States, African American men are more likely to develop prostate cancer than white men (203.5 vs 121.9 cases per 100,000 men). African American men are also more than twice as likely as white men to die of prostate cancer (44.1 vs 19.1 deaths per 100,000 men).<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup> The higher death rate is attributable in part to an earlier age at cancer onset, more advanced cancer stage at diagnosis, and higher rates of more aggressive cancer (ie, higher tumor grade). These differences in death from prostate cancer may also reflect that African American men have lower rates of receiving high-quality care.</p>
<h4>Available Evidence</h4>
<p>The USPSTF searched for evidence about the potential benefits and harms of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in African American men.</p>
<h4>Potential Benefits</h4>
<p>The PLCO trial enrolled 4% African American men, which is not enough to determine whether the overall trial results differed for African American men.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation17""><span style=""font-size: small;"">17</span></a></sup> The ERSPC trial did not record or report any race-specific subgroup information. The low proportion of persons of African descent in European countries during the study period makes it likely that these groups were not well represented.</p>
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
<p>An analysis from the PLCO trial found that African American men were significantly more likely to have major infections after prostate biopsy than white men (odds ratio [OR], 7.1 [95% CI, 2.7-18.0]).<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation13""><span style=""font-size: small;"">13</span></a></sup> Evidence is insufficient to compare the risk of false-positive results, potential for overdiagnosis, and magnitude of harms from prostate cancer treatment in African American vs other men.</p>
<h4>Advising African American Men</h4>
<p>Based on the available evidence, the USPSTF is not able to make a separate, specific recommendation on PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in African American men. Although it is possible that screening may offer greater benefits for African American men compared with the general population, currently no direct evidence demonstrates whether this is true. Screening, and subsequent diagnosis and treatment, has the potential to increase exposure to potential harms. Decision analysis models suggest that given the higher rates of aggressive prostate cancer in African American men, PSA-based screening may provide greater benefit to African American men than the general population. These models also suggest a potential mortality benefit for African American men when beginning screening before age 55 years. The USPSTF believes that a reasonable approach for clinicians is to inform African American men about their increased risk of developing and dying of prostate cancer as well as the potential benefits and harms of screening so they can make an informed, personal decision about whether to be screened. Although the USPSTF found inadequate evidence about how benefits may differ for African American men, it recognizes the epidemiologic data showing that African American men may develop prostate cancer at younger ages than average-risk men and understands that some African American men and their clinicians will continue to screen at younger ages. The USPSTF does not recommend screening for prostate cancer in men, including African American men, older than 70 years.</p>
<p>The USPSTF strongly encourages research on screening for and treatment of prostate cancer in African American men. It is important to consider both the potential additional benefits and harms to fully understand the value of screening. Studies are needed to confirm that African American men who undergo screening receive similar or greater reductions in prostate cancer mortality compared with men in the general population, as well as to explore the optimal screening frequency and whether beginning screening before age 55 years provides additional benefits in African American men. Studies are also needed to better understand strategies to mitigate harms and maximize benefits of screening, diagnostic follow-up, and treatment (including active surveillance) in African American men. It is also important that research and quality improvement activities continue to work to eliminate disparities in access to high-quality care for men with prostate cancer.</p>
<h3>Screening for Prostate Cancer in Men With a Family History</h3>
<h4>Burden</h4>
<p>The introduction of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer has substantially altered the epidemiologic data for prostate cancer, greatly increasing the number of men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer and thus also the number of men with a father, brother, or son with a history of prostate cancer.</p>
<h4>Available Evidence</h4>
<p>It is generally accepted that men with a family history of prostate cancer are more likely to develop prostate cancer. A study of twins in Scandinavia estimated that genetic factors may account for up to 42% of prostate cancer risk.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation18""><span style=""font-size: small;"">18</span></a></sup> An analysis from the Finnish site of the ERSPC trial concluded that men with at least 1 first-degree relative with prostate cancer were 30% more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer than men without a family history.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation19""><span style=""font-size: small;"">19</span></a></sup> Men with 3 first-degree relatives with prostate cancer or 2 close relatives on the same side of the family with prostate cancer diagnosed before age 55 years may have an inheritable form of prostate cancer associated with genetic changes passed down from one generation to the next. This type of prostate cancer is thought to account for less than 10% of all prostate cancer cases.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation20""><span style=""font-size: small;"">20</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The USPSTF searched for evidence about the potential benefits and harms of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men with a family history of prostate cancer.</p>
<h4>Potential Benefits</h4>
<p>Of the 7% of men in the PLCO trial who reported a family history of prostate cancer on a baseline questionnaire, prostate cancer mortality was lower among white men in the intervention group than in the control group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.49 [95% CI, 0.22-1.10]; <em>P</em> = 0.08),<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation21""><span style=""font-size: small;"">21</span></a></sup> but the difference was not significant and the confidence interval was wide.</p>
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
<p>No studies have assessed the risk of harms related to screening for, diagnosis of, or treatment of prostate cancer based on family history of prostate cancer.</p>
<h4>Advising Men With a Family History of Prostate Cancer</h4>
<p>Based on the available evidence, the USPSTF is not able to make a separate, specific recommendation on PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men with a family history of prostate cancer. Although it is possible that screening may offer additional potential benefits for these men compared with the general population, screening also has the potential to increase exposure to potential harms, especially among men with relatives whose cancer was overdiagnosed. Men who have a first-degree relative who had advanced prostate cancer at diagnosis, developed metastatic prostate cancer, or died of prostate cancer are probably the most likely to benefit from screening. The USPSTF believes that a reasonable approach for clinicians is to inform men with a family history of prostate cancer, particularly those with multiple first-degree relatives with prostate cancer, about their increased risk of developing cancer as well as the potential earlier age at disease onset. This discussion should include the potential benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer so these men have the opportunity to make an informed, personal decision about whether to be screened. Although the USPSTF found inadequate evidence about how benefits may differ for men with a family history of prostate cancer, it recognizes the epidemiologic data showing that these men are at a greater than average risk and understands that some men and their clinicians will continue to screen at younger ages in men with a family history. The USPSTF does not recommend screening for prostate cancer in men, including men with a family history of prostate cancer, older than 70 years.</p>
<p>Epidemiologic studies examining outcomes in men with relatives who died of prostate cancer vs men with relatives diagnosed with prostate cancer who died of other causes may help provide better guidance. Studies are needed that explore the optimal screening frequency and whether beginning screening before age 55 years provides additional benefits for men with a family history of prostate cancer. Additional research is also needed to help identify men with an inheritable form of prostate cancer and to understand how the potential benefits and harms of screening, including screening intervals and starting ages, may differ in these men compared with the general population.</p>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
<p>There are many areas in need of research to improve screening for and treatment of prostate cancer, including</p>
<ul>
<li>Comparing different screening strategies, including different screening intervals, to fully understand the effects on benefits and harms</li>
<li>Developing, validating, and providing longer-term follow-up of screening and diagnostic techniques, including risk stratification tools, use of baseline PSA level as a risk factor, and use of non&ndash;PSA-based adjunctive tests that can distinguish nonprogressive and slowly progressive cancer from cancer that is likely to become symptomatic and affect quality or length of life, to reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment</li>
<li>Screening for and treatment of prostate cancer in African American men, including understanding the potential benefits and harms of different starting ages and screening intervals and the use of active surveillance; given the large disparities in prostate cancer mortality in African American men, this should be a national priority</li>
<li>How to better inform men with a family history of prostate cancer about the benefits and harms of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer, including the potential differences in outcomes between men with relatives who died of prostate cancer and men with relatives diagnosed with prostate cancer who died of other causes</li>
<li>How to refine active prostate cancer treatments to minimize harms</li>
</ul>
<p>How to better understand patient values about the known benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of prostate cancer; how these values influence men&rsquo;s assessment of the overall benefit vs harm; how to best implement informed decision making programs that incorporate the values and preferences of men and their families about screening; how to adapt the informed decision-making process to a range of diverse patient populations as screening, diagnosis, and treatment strategies evolve; and the effects of informed decision making on health outcomes and patient experience</p>",,193,"<p><strong>Recommendations of Others</strong></p>

The American Urological Association<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation42""><span style=""font-size: small;"">42</span></a></sup> recommends that men aged 55 to 69 years with a life expectancy of more than 10 to 15 years be informed of the benefits and harms of screening and engage in shared decision making with their clinicians, taking into account each man&rsquo;s values and preferences. It notes that to reduce the harms of screening, the screening interval should be 2 or more years. The American Urological Association also notes that decisions about screening, including potentially starting screening before age 55 years, should be individual ones for African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer. The American Cancer Society<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation43""><span style=""font-size: small;"">43</span></a></sup> adopted detailed screening recommendations in 2016 that highlight the importance of shared decision making and the need for informed discussion of the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits of screening. It recommends conversations about screening beginning at age 50 years and earlier for African American men and men with a father or brother with a history of prostate cancer before age 65 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation replaces the 2012 USPSTF recommendation<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation38""><span style=""font-size: small;"">38</span></a></sup> on PSA-based screening for prostate cancer. In 2012, the USPSTF concluded that, although there are potential benefits of screening for prostate cancer, these benefits do not outweigh the expected harms enough to recommend routine screening (D recommendation). The change in recommendation grade is based in part on additional evidence that increased the USPSTF&rsquo;s certainty about the reductions in risk of dying of prostate cancer and risk of metastatic disease. Longer-term follow-up of the ERSPC trial and from some ERSPC trial sites found that PSA-based screening for prostate cancer prevents 1.28 men from dying of prostate cancer for every 1000 men screened. In addition, a subset of ERSPC trial sites have since reported that screening 1000 men aged 55 to 69 years may prevent approximately 3 men from developing metastatic prostate cancer. Longer-term, 12.7-year results of the PIVOT trial became available since the posting of the draft recommendation statement and are similar to the 10-year results. Studies continue to demonstrate the harms of PSA-based screening, including false-positive results, complications from transrectal prostate biopsies, overdiagnosis (which may occur in 20%-50% of cases of screen-detected cancer, based on estimates from trial data), psychological harms, and harms of treatment, including urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. The change in recommendation grade further reflects new evidence about and increased use of active surveillance of low-risk prostate cancer, which may reduce the risk of subsequent harms from screening. This recommendation also clearly identifies African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer as having higher risk for prostate cancer and provides additional information to help support these men in making informed decisions about screening. For the C recommendation for men aged 55 to 69 years, the USPSTF&rsquo;s intention is to convey that each man&rsquo;s values may shift the balance to a net benefit of screening and to promote the importance of informed decision making prior to screening. The USPSTF continues to find that the benefits of screening do not outweigh the harms in men 70 years and older and recommends against screening in these men.</p>","Burden of Disease
For men in the United States, the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer is approximately 11%, and the lifetime risk of dying of prostate cancer is 2.5%.1 In 2013, the most recent year for which data are available, approximately 172,000 men in the United States were diagnosed with prostate cancer and almost 28,000 died of prostate cancer.22 From 2003 to 2012, the prostate cancer mortality rate among US men decreased significantly by 3.4% per year (3.3% and 3.9% per year in white and black men, respectively).23 Most cases of prostate cancer found in autopsy studies are microscopic, well-differentiated lesions that did not affect men’s health during their lifetime. Data from screening trials suggest that many cases of low-risk cancer detected by screening would never have caused symptoms or affected men’s health had they never been identified through screening.
Scope of Review
To update its 2012 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review of the evidence regarding the benefits and harms of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer and subsequent treatment of screen-detected prostate cancer.3, 4 The USPSTF also commissioned a review of multiple contextual questions, including a review of existing decision analysis models and what they suggest about the potential for mitigating the harms of screening and treatment and the overdiagnosis rate of PSA-based screening.14, 24 The commissioned reviews also examined the effectiveness and harms of PSA-based screening in patient subpopulations at higher risk of prostate cancer, including older men, African American men, and men with a family history of prostate cancer.
Effectiveness of Early Detection
Potential Benefits of Screening
To understand the potential benefits of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer, the USPSTF examined the results of the ERSPC, PLCO, and CAP trials and site-specific reports from 4 ERSPC trial sites. To understand the effectiveness of treatment of screen-detected, early-stage prostate cancer, the USPSTF also examined the results of 3 randomized trials and 9 cohort studies.3
The ERSPC trial randomly assigned a core group of more than 160,000 men aged 55 to 69 years from 7 European countries to PSA-based screening vs usual care.8 Four ERSPC sites reported on the cumulative incidence of metastatic prostate cancer. After a median follow-up of 12 years, the risk of developing metastatic prostate cancer was 30% lower among men randomized to screening compared with usual care (RR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.60-0.82]; P = 0.001). The absolute reduction in long-term risk of metastatic prostate cancer associated with screening was 3.1 cases per 1000 men.11 After a median follow-up of 13 years, the prostate cancer mortality rate among men aged 55 to 69 years was 4.3 deaths per 10,000 person-years in the screening group and 5.4 deaths per 10,000 person-years in the usual care group (RR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.69-0.91]; P = 0.001).8 The ERSPC trial did not find a reduction in all-cause mortality.8
The results of the overall ERSPC trial provide some of the most important evidence about the potential benefits of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer. The trial was rated as fair quality by the USPSTF review because of several important methodologic issues, including observed differences in how men in the screening and control groups were treated for prostate cancer. Among men diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer, a greater proportion of men in the screening group underwent radical prostatectomy (41.3%) than in the usual care group (32.8%).25 Although one might expect treatment differences by screening group if screening produces a shift toward more localized clinical stages, treatment differences across ERSPC study groups persisted even with stratification by clinical stage and tumor grade. The cause for these differences is not known.
In the prostate component of the PLCO trial, more than 76,000 men aged 55 to 74 years were randomized to either annual PSA-based screening for 6 years or usual care. Abnormal screening results (PSA level >4.0 ng/mL or abnormal digital rectal examination findings) were forwarded to patients and their primary care clinician, who coordinated further diagnostic evaluation.17 The majority of men were non-Hispanic white (86.2% and 83.8% of the screening and control groups, respectively). Approximately one-third of men in both groups had either a PSA test or digital rectal examination within the 3 years prior to enrollment. An estimated 78% of men in the control group had a PSA test during the screening phase of the trial.25 On average, men in the intervention group received 5 PSA tests during the screening phase of the trial and men in the usual care group received 3 PSA tests.26 This high PSA testing rate in the control group limits the study’s ability to identify a potential screening benefit. Despite the common use of PSA testing in the control group, after 13 years more cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed in the screening group than in the control group (108.4 vs 97.1 cases per 10,000 person-years, respectively) (RR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.07-1.17]). At a median follow-up of 14.8 years in the PLCO trial, the prostate cancer mortality rate was not significantly different between the intervention and control group (4.8 vs 4.6 deaths per 10,000 person-years, respectively) (RR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.87-1.24]).7 This result does not rule out the possibility of a reduction in prostate cancer mortality from screening for prostate cancer.
The CAP trial was a cluster randomized trial in the United Kingdom among 415,357 men aged 50 to 69 years invited for a single PSA-based screening for prostate cancer.12 Men with a PSA level of 3.0 ng/mL or greater were referred for biopsy. Men with localized prostate cancer were offered enrollment into the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial, in which the primary outcome was prostate cancer mortality. At intervention sites, 34% of men received a valid PSA screening test; the percentage of men at control sites who received a PSA test for screening purposes was estimated to be about 10% to 15% over 10 years. After a median follow-up of 10 years, there was no significant difference in prostate cancer mortality between the group of men invited to screening and control group (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.94-1.03]; P = 0.49).
Neither the ERSPC, PLCO, or CAP trials, nor any of the ERSPC site-specific analyses, found an overall all-cause mortality benefit from screening for prostate cancer.
There are limited data on the benefit of screening in younger men. The PLCO trial did not recruit men younger than 55 years. The ERSPC trial reported a slightly higher and nonsignificant risk reduction (RR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.28-2.49]) for prostate cancer mortality in men aged 50 to 55 years compared with men in the core group aged 55 to 69 years (RR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.69-0.91]).
There are few data that screening is effective in men older than 70 years. The PLCO and ERSPC trials enrolled men 74 years and younger; men older than 70 years were not in the core age group (55-69 years) in the ERSPC trial. The CAP trial did not enroll men older than 69 years. In the ERSPC trial, the prostate cancer mortality rate ratio in the screening vs control group among men 70 years and older at randomization was 1.17 (95% CI, 0.82-1.66); however, a statistical test found no significant heterogeneity across age groups. In the PLCO trial, the analogous rate ratio at a median follow-up of 13 years among men aged 65 to 74 years at randomization was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.77-1.37); the test for heterogeneity was not significant (P = 0.81).
Potential Benefits of Treatment
The USPSTF examined 3 good-quality randomized trials of treatment of localized prostate cancer and 9 observational cohort studies to understand the potential benefit of active treatment (radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy) compared with conservative treatment (active surveillance or watchful waiting) on overall mortality, prostate cancer mortality, and progression to metastatic prostate cancer.3
The UK ProtecT trial randomized more than 1600 men aged 50 to 69 years with screen-detected, localized prostate cancer to radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, or active surveillance and followed them up for 10 years. Approximately 77% of men had low-grade prostate cancer (Gleason score of 6) with a favorable prognosis. Thus, some men randomized to active surveillance had an intermediate-grade tumor (or other tumor characteristics) such that they may not have been considered a candidate for active surveillance in some settings. The trial did not find a significant improvement in all-cause or prostate cancer mortality in any of the treatment groups. The unexpectedly high survival rate across the trial groups (99%) made any potential differences harder to detect. Longer-term follow-up studies may provide important additional information. The trial reported a significant reduction in progression to metastatic cancer when comparing both radical prostatectomy (61% reduction [95% CI, 27%-79%]) and radiation therapy (52% reduction [95% CI, 13%-73%]) with active surveillance. In the active surveillance group, 6.0% of men developed metastatic cancer, compared with 2.7% and 2.3% in the radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy groups, respectively. During the 10-year follow-up period, 54.8% of men randomized to active surveillance crossed over to active treatment.15
The other 2 randomized trials of radical prostatectomy took place prior to widespread PSA-based screening and thus recruited many men with tumors detected from clinical symptoms. Approximately 50% of men in the US-based Prostate Cancer Intervention vs Observation Trial (PIVOT) and almost 90% of men in the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group-4 (SPCG-4) trial had palpable tumors. The SPCG-4 trial compared radical prostatectomy with watchful waiting (a passive protocol dissimilar to active surveillance) and found a significant reduction over 13 years in all-cause and prostate cancer mortality.27 The PIVOT trial did not find significant reductions overall in all-cause or prostate cancer mortality.28 Recent results from extended follow-up of the PIVOT trial to a median of 12.7 years reported similar results; radical prostatectomy did not significantly reduce prostate cancer mortality (HR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.39-1.02]) or all-cause mortality (HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.81-1.09]) compared with conservative management.29
Several cohort studies examining radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy found significant reductions in prostate cancer mortality when comparing active treatment with watchful waiting or other conservative approaches.3 The cohort study results, however, should be interpreted with caution because of the potential for bias in treatment assignment. In these clinical settings, men who are healthier may have been more likely to receive active treatment.
Two studies reported on the difference in benefit by age. The PIVOT trial reported no significant differences by age (younger or older than 65 years) in the association between radical prostatectomy and all-cause mortality. In the SPCG-4 trial, the risk of all-cause mortality after radical prostatectomy vs watchful waiting was not significantly reduced among men 65 years and older (but was significantly reduced in men younger than 65 years).
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
Potential Harms of Screening and Diagnosis
In addition to the ERSPC and PLCO trials, the USPSTF examined the results of a good-quality cohort study embedded within the ProtecT trial (Prostate Biopsy Effects [ProbE]), a fair-quality cohort study conducted in the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health system, as well as a report on complications of prostate biopsy from the ERSPC Rotterdam site to understand the potential harms of screening and diagnosis.3
In the large RCTs, one-fourth to one-third of men offered PSA-based screening had at least 1 positive screening test result. In the PLCO trial, 13% of men had undergone at least 1 biopsy. In the ERSPC trial, nearly 28 biopsies were performed for every 100 men randomized to screening.3 In the ProbE trial, 7.3% of men reported moderate or greater pain, 5.5% reported moderate to severe fever, and 26.6% reported troublesome hematospermia within the 35 days after biopsy.28 Complications from transrectal prostate biopsy resulted in 1.3% of men in the UK cohort, 1.6% of men in the VA cohort, and 0.5% of men in the Rotterdam cohort requiring hospitalization.30-32 In these studies, two-thirds to three-fourths of biopsies demonstrated that the PSA screening test was a false positive.3
Overdiagnosis, the identification of asymptomatic cancer that would never cause symptoms or contribute to death, is one of the most important harms of PSA-based screening programs. Although there is no way to conclusively determine the overdiagnosis rate, the USPSTF used data from trials and reviewed decision analysis models to estimate the overdiagnosis rate. Trial data suggest that 21% of cases of screen-detected cancer in the PLCO trial and 50% in the ERSPC trial were overdiagnosed.3 Using a different type of methodology (ie, not estimates based directly on single trials),3 decision analysis models produced by the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network estimated that between 1988 and 2000 in the United States, the overdiagnosis rate among cases of screen-detected prostate cancer was 22% to 42%.24 Overdiagnosis increases with age; 1 study estimates that the overdiagnosis rate is more than 15-fold higher in men older than 85 years than in men aged 50 to 54 years.24
Men older than 70 years in the ERSPC trial had a higher rate of false-positive results than younger men (younger than 55 years) (20.6% vs 3.5% in the first screening round, respectively). In the VA cohort study, fewer older men were sent for biopsy for a PSA level greater than 4.0 ng/mL (50.5% of men aged 65-69 years vs 25.4% of men aged 75-79 years). Data from the PLCO trial suggest that older men may be more likely than younger men to experience biopsy complications (28.2 vs 17.7 complications per 1000 biopsies, respectively; OR, 1.4 [95% CI, 0.9-2.4]; P = 0.06).
The USPSTF reviewed studies evaluating psychological harms of screening and diagnosis. In 2 observational studies, men who had abnormal PSA screening results but benign biopsy results had significantly increased worry about prostate cancer at 6- to 8-week and at 1-year follow-up compared with men with normal PSA screening results.33 After 1 year, one-third of men with a benign biopsy finding after an abnormal screening result thought about prostate cancer “a lot” or “some,” compared with 18% of men who had a normal PSA level (P = 0.005). In a prospective cohort study embedded in the UK ProtecT trial (n = 7344), there was no increase in anxiety or depression and similar scores on the Mental Health Component of the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey compared with baseline among men who had abnormal PSA screening results.34 In a cross-sectional US study (n = 210), men with benign biopsy findings after abnormal PSA screening results did not have significantly greater anxiety than men who had normal results.35
Potential Harms of Treatment
Men who undergo active surveillance may undergo repeated biopsies and be exposed to potential repeated harms from biopsies (as discussed above). In addition, a significant proportion of men will go on to have active treatment with surgery or radiation therapy, with resultant harms (as discussed below).
The USPSTF identified 3 good-quality and 1 fair-quality randomized trials and 7 large fair-quality observational studies that examined the potential harms of active treatment of prostate cancer.3 A meta-analysis of the harms of radical prostatectomy concluded that 1 man will experience substantial urinary incontinence (requiring daily use of pads or worse) for every 7.9 men who undergo radical prostatectomy rather than conservative management (95% CI, 5.4-12.2), and 1 man will experience long-term erectile dysfunction for every 2.7 men who undergo radical prostatectomy rather than conservative management (95% CI, 2.2-3.6).3 In addition, more than 20% of men in the PIVOT trial had a perioperative complication and 5.3% of men in a large US cohort study required reintervention for a surgical complication.3 A meta-analysis of the harms of radiation therapy found that 1 man will experience long-term erectile dysfunction for every 7 men treated with radiation therapy rather than conservative management (95% CI, 5.1-10.7).3 Although results are conflicting across cohort studies regarding the association of urinary incontinence and radiation therapy, rates of fecal incontinence and bowel urgency were as high as 31.8% after radiation therapy in 1 cohort study,36 and these bowel complications were more common compared with conservative management in 2 trials and 3 cohort studies.3
After a median follow-up of 6 years in the ProtecT trial, there was no significant difference among men randomized to radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, or active surveillance in reported anxiety, depression, health status, and cancer-related quality of life.36 The older SPCG-4 trial had similar results after a median follow-up of 12 years when comparing men who received radical prostatectomy vs watchful waiting.37 There was no evidence of an adverse effect of radical prostatectomy on generic quality-of-life measures compared with conservative management in cohort studies.
In several studies, men older than 70 years had a significantly increased risk of medical complications and perioperative mortality after radical prostatectomy compared with younger men.3
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
Conclusions from decision analysis models, which are consistent with the findings of randomized trials and cohort studies, suggest that more aggressive screening strategies, particularly those that use a lower PSA threshold for biopsy than generally used in the United States, provide the greatest potential reduction in death from prostate cancer. However, these strategies are also associated with more false positives, more biopsies, and higher rates of overdiagnosis.24
Options for reducing the overdiagnosis rate include lowering the age at which to stop screening, extending the interval between screenings, and using higher PSA thresholds for biopsy. However, no strategy completely eliminates overdiagnosis. PSA-based screening for prostate cancer every 2 or 4 years instead of annually appears to provide a good trade-off between a reduction in overdiagnosis and a small reduction in mortality benefit.24
Decision analysis models confirm the USPSTF’s conclusion that the overall benefit of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer is sensitive to the values of individual men. The magnitude of net benefit of PSA-based screening depends on how each man weighs the potential benefits and harms of screening, diagnosis, and treatment. The value a man places on potential benefits and harms may also change over time. It may therefore be useful for clinicians to regularly revisit the decision to screen (or not screen) with their patients (Table).
Although active surveillance may reduce exposure to the potential harms of active treatment, it may not be viewed favorably by some men who value definitive action, are concerned about repeat biopsies, or want to avoid a potential increase in metastatic cancer.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from April 11 to May 8, 2017. A number of comments suggested that because men are now living longer, they should be screened beyond 70 years of age. However, the USPSTF considered other evidence in addition to data on life expectancy when recommending against screening in men older than 70 years, including results from large screening trials that did not report a mortality benefit for men older than 70 years and evidence on the increased likelihood of harm from screening, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment. Several comments requested a recommendation for younger men and for baseline PSA-based screening in men 40 years and older or 50 years and older. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that screening younger men or performing baseline PSA-based screening provides benefit.
Several comments asked for clarification about what new evidence led to the change from a D to a C grade. The new evidence included longer-term follow-up of the ERSPC trial and new data on reductions in risk of metastatic disease with screening. Although the added benefit reported from the additional follow-up to 13 years (from 10 years) in the ERSPC trial increased the number of lives saved from 1.07 to 1.28 (a small amount, according to some comments), these results gave the USPSTF more confidence that the benefit of screening could be greater over a 20- to 30-year period. Evidence newly considered since the draft recommendation statement was posted for comment includes the CAP trial, evidence on psychological harms, and longer-term follow-up of the PIVOT trial. This evidence led the USPSTF to continue to conclude that there is a small amount of benefit for some men. The USPSTF recognizes the importance of the potential harms of screening and treatment, including psychological harms and harms from active surveillance, and has added information about this evidence to the Rationale, Clinical Considerations, and Discussion sections. New evidence from the recently published CAP trial was added. Given the limitations of the CAP trial, including that it only examined 1-time PSA-based screening and the small difference between the percentage of men in the control and intervention groups (approximately 10%-15% vs 34%, respectively) who received PSA-based screening, the results of this trial did not change the USPSTF’s overall assessment of the evidence and its recommendation.","<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer that affects men. In the United States, the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer is approximately 13%, and the lifetime risk of dying of prostate cancer is 2.5%.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup> Many men with prostate cancer never experience symptoms and, without screening, would never know they have the disease. In autopsy studies of men who died of other causes, more than 20% of men aged 50 to 59 years and more than 33% of men aged 70 to 79 years were found to have prostate cancer.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation2""><span style=""font-size: small;"">2</span></a></sup> In some men, the cancer is more aggressive and leads to death. The median age of death from prostate cancer is 80 years, and more than two-thirds of all men who die of prostate cancer are older than 75 years.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup> African American men have an increased lifetime risk of prostate cancer death compared with those of other races/ethnicities (4.2% for African American men, 2.9% for Hispanic men, 2.3% for white men, and 2.1% for Asian and Pacific Islander men).<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>Screening for prostate cancer begins with a test that measures the amount of PSA protein in the blood. An elevated PSA level may be caused by prostate cancer but can also be caused by other conditions, including an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia) and inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis). Some men without prostate cancer may therefore have positive screening results (ie, &ldquo;false-positive&rdquo; results). Men with a positive PSA test result may undergo a transrectal ultrasound-guided core-needle biopsy of the prostate to diagnose prostate cancer.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>
<p>The goal of screening for prostate cancer is to identify high-risk, localized prostate cancer that can be successfully treated, thereby preventing the morbidity and mortality associated with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Adequate evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) shows that PSA-based screening programs in men aged 55 to 69 years may prevent approximately 1.3 deaths from prostate cancer over approximately 13 years per 1000 men screened.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation3""><span style=""font-size: small;"">3</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation4"">4</a></sup></span> Screening programs may also prevent approximately 3 cases of metastatic prostate cancer per 1000 men screened.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation3""><span style=""font-size: small;"">3</span></a></sup> Current results from screening trials show no reductions in all-cause mortality from screening. There is inadequate evidence to assess whether the benefits for African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer aged 55 to 69 years are different than the benefits for the average-risk population. There is also inadequate evidence to assess whether there are benefits to starting screening in these high-risk groups before age 55 years.</p>
<p>Adequate evidence from RCTs is consistent with no benefit of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer on prostate cancer mortality in men 70 years and older.</p>
<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>
<p>The harms of screening for prostate cancer include harms from the PSA screening test and subsequent harms from diagnosis and treatment. Potential harms of screening include frequent false-positive results and psychological harms. One major trial in men screened every 2 to 4 years concluded that, over 10 years, more than 15% of men experienced at least 1 false-positive test result.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation5""><span style=""font-size: small;"">5</span></a></sup> Harms of diagnostic procedures include complications of prostate biopsy, such as pain, hematospermia (blood in semen or ejaculate), and infection. Approximately 1% of prostate biopsies result in complications requiring hospitalization. The false-positive and complication rates from biopsy are higher in older men.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation3""><span style=""font-size: small;"">3</span></a></sup> Adequate evidence suggests that the harms of screening and diagnostic procedures are at least small.</p>
<p>PSA-based screening for prostate cancer leads to the diagnosis of prostate cancer in some men whose cancer would never have become symptomatic during their lifetime. Treatment of these men results in harms and provides them with no benefit. This is known as overdiagnosis, and follow-up of large randomized trials suggests that 20% to 50% of men diagnosed with prostate cancer through screening may be overdiagnosed.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation3""><span style=""font-size: small;"">3</span></a></sup> Overdiagnosis rates would be expected to increase with age and to be highest in men 70 years and older because older men have high risk of death from competing causes.</p>
<p>Harms of prostate cancer treatment include erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and bothersome bowel symptoms. About 1 in 5 men who undergo radical prostatectomy develop long-term urinary incontinence requiring use of pads, and 2 in 3 men will experience long-term erectile dysfunction. More than half of men who receive radiation therapy experience long-term sexual erectile dysfunction and up to 1 in 6 men experience long-term bothersome bowel symptoms, including bowel urgency and fecal incontinence.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation3""><span style=""font-size: small;"">3</span></a></sup> Adequate evidence suggests that the harms of overdiagnosis and treatment are at least moderate.</p>
<p>Adequate evidence shows that the harms of screening in men older than 70 years are at least moderate and greater than in younger men because of increased risk of false-positive results, harms from diagnostic biopsy, and harms from treatment.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>PSA-based screening for prostate cancer has both potential benefits and harms. The USPSTF does not recommend screening for prostate cancer unless men express a preference for screening after being informed of and understanding the benefits and risks. The decision about whether to be screened for prostate cancer requires that each man incorporate his own values about the potential benefits and harms. The potential harms of screening, diagnostic procedures, and treatment occur soon after screening takes place. Although the potential benefits may occur any time after screening, they generally occur years after treatment, because progression from asymptomatic, screen-detected cancer to symptomatic, metastasized cancer or death (if it occurs at all) may take years or decades to occur.</p>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men aged 55 to 69 years is small for some men. How each man weighs specific benefits and harms will determine whether the overall net benefit is small.</p>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the potential benefits of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men 70 years and older do not outweigh the expected harms.</p>",Screening for Prostate Cancer,"Prostate Cancer, Screening, 2018"

<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
<p>Research is needed to determine whether daily supplementation with doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D and greater than 1000 mg of calcium reduces fracture incidence in postmenopausal women and in older men. Prospective studies should assess the potential benefits of vitamin D and calcium supplementation in premenopausal women on fracture incidence later in life. Studies need to be adequately powered and should evaluate consistent fracture outcomes. Studies are also needed to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on diverse populations. Because white women have the highest risk for osteoporotic fractures, most fracture prevention studies have been conducted in this population, and it is difficult to extrapolate results to nonwhite populations. In addition, more studies evaluating the potential harms of supplementation are needed, particularly studies on calcium and potential adverse cardiovascular outcomes.</p>

<p><strong>RECOMMENDATION OF OTHERS</strong></p>
<p>The Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine)<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vitamin-d-calcium-or-combined-supplementation-for-the-primary-prevention-of-fractures-in-adults-preventive-medication#citation37""><span style=""font-size: small;"">37</span></a></sup> and the World Health Organization<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vitamin-d-calcium-or-combined-supplementation-for-the-primary-prevention-of-fractures-in-adults-preventive-medication#citation38""><span style=""font-size: small;"">38</span></a></sup> recommend standards for adequate daily intake of calcium and vitamin D as a part of overall health. Neither organization has recommendations specific to fracture prevention. The Institute of Medicine notes the challenge of determining dietary reference intakes given the complex interrelationship between calcium and vitamin D, the inconsistency of studies examining bone health outcomes, and the need to limit sun exposure to minimize skin cancer risk. The National Osteoporosis Foundation supports the Institute of Medicine&rsquo;s recommendations regarding calcium consumption and recommends that adults 50 years or older consume 800 to 1000 IU of vitamin D daily.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vitamin-d-calcium-or-combined-supplementation-for-the-primary-prevention-of-fractures-in-adults-preventive-medication#citation39""><span style=""font-size: small;"">39</span></a></sup> The Endocrine Society recommends that adults 65 years or older consume 800 IU of vitamin D daily for the prevention of falls and fractures.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vitamin-d-calcium-or-combined-supplementation-for-the-primary-prevention-of-fractures-in-adults-preventive-medication#citation40""><span style=""font-size: small;"">40</span></a></sup> The American Geriatric Society recommends that adults 65 years or older take daily vitamin D supplementation of at least 1000 IU as well as calcium to reduce the risk for fractures and falls.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vitamin-d-calcium-or-combined-supplementation-for-the-primary-prevention-of-fractures-in-adults-preventive-medication#citation41""><span style=""font-size: small;"">41</span></a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE OF PREVIOUS USPSTF RECOMMENDATIONS</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation is consistent with the 2013 USPSTF recommendation on vitamin D supplementation, with or without calcium, to prevent fractures.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vitamin-d-calcium-or-combined-supplementation-for-the-primary-prevention-of-fractures-in-adults-preventive-medication#citation36""><span style=""font-size: small;"">36</span></a></sup> The USPSTF added evidence on calcium supplementation alone to the evidence review for this recommendation; however, the evidence was too limited to make a separate recommendation about calcium supplementation alone. Evidence from more recent studies confirms that the evidence on fracture prevention with doses of vitamin D greater than 400 IU daily is inconsistent and inadequate, because of underpowering of studies at higher doses. Newer evidence confirms an increased risk for kidney stones with combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation and also suggests no increased incidence of cardiovascular disease with vitamin D supplementation.</p>

Because of the aging population, osteoporotic fractures are an increasingly important cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Approximately 2 million osteoporotic fractures occurred in the United States in 2005, and annual incidence is projected to increase to more than 3 million fractures by 2025.2 Nearly half of all women older than 50 years will experience an osteoporotic fracture during their lifetime.23 Fractures are associated with chronic pain, disability, and decreased quality of life. Hip fractures significantly increase morbidity and mortality. From 2004–2014, hip fractures alone accounted for approximately 300,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States.24 During the first 3 months after a hip fracture, a patient’s mortality risk is 5 to 8 times that of a similarly aged person living in the community without a fracture.25 Nearly 20% of patients with hip fracture subsequently receive care in a long-term care facility.23
Scope of Review
The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review on vitamin D, calcium, and combined supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling adults.1, 26 The review excluded studies conducted in populations with a known disorder related to bone metabolism (eg, osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency), taking medications known to be associated with osteoporosis (eg, long-term steroids), or with a previous fracture. The review also excluded studies that recruited participants based on a history of falls or high risk for falls, because these populations are covered in a separate evidence review, and studies conducted in institutional care settings, such as long-term care facilities, because persons living in these settings are often at a very increased risk for falls. Evaluating evidence on the use of vitamin D to treat vitamin D deficiency or to treat osteoporosis is beyond the scope of this review.
Effectiveness of Preventive Medication
The USPSTF reviewed evidence from 8 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures; 4 trials evaluated vitamin D supplementation (n=10,606), 2 trials evaluated calcium supplementation (n=339), and 2 trials evaluated combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation (n=36,727).1, 26 Four studies included men (representing data from 5900 men) and 4 studies were conducted exclusively in women (total of 41,772 women across all 8 studies). The mean age of study participants ranged from 53 to 80 years. In the 5 studies reporting race/ethnicity, 83% to 100% of participants were white; the remaining 3 studies did not report this information. Four of the studies were conducted in the United States, while 4 were conducted in the United Kingdom, Finland, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. Fracture outcomes varied and included total fractures, hip fractures, major osteoporotic fractures, nonvertebral fractures, vertebral fractures (clinical, morphometric, or both), upper extremity fractures, lower arm/wrist fractures, and peripheral fractures.
Four studies reported on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on fracture prevention.1 Two studies evaluated daily doses of 400 IU or less (n=2810)27, 28 and did not find any significant difference in any fracture outcome. The primary aim of the larger study (n=2578) (28) was reduction in incidence of hip and other osteoporotic fractures. Two studies evaluated higher doses of vitamin D: a loading dose of 200,000 IU followed by 100,000 IU monthly (n=5110)16, 17 and 100,000 IU every 4 months (n=2686).29 These 2 studies reported inconsistent findings. The larger study did not find any significant difference in nonvertebral fractures (absolute risk difference [ARD], 0.75% [95% CI, -0.51% to 2.04%]; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.19 [95% CI, 0.94 to 1.50]); however, the primary outcome of the study was not fracture prevention.1, 16 The smaller study found a reduction in total fractures (ARD, -2.26% [95% CI, -4.53% to 0.00%]; age-adjusted relative risk [RR], 0.78 [95% CI, 0.61 to 0.99]) but nonsignificant reductions in hip fractures (ARD, -0.23% [95% CI, -1.20% to 0.74%]; age-adjusted RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.47 to 1.53]) and clinical vertebral fractures (ARD, -0.75% [95% CI, -1.73% to 0.23%]; age-adjusted RR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.35 to 1.14]).1, 29
Two studies reported on the effect of calcium supplementation on fracture prevention (n=339).1, 30, 31 The studies evaluated daily doses of 1200 and 1600 mg. Neither study found a significant difference in fracture outcomes with calcium supplementation, although neither study was adequately powered to detect differences.
Two studies evaluated the effect of combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation on fracture prevention (n=36,727).1, 14, 32 The much larger WHI trial (n=36,282), which evaluated a daily dose of 400 IU of vitamin D with 1000 mg of calcium compared with placebo, was adequately powered to detect the effect of combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation on risk for hip fractures and found no statistically significant difference between groups (ARD, -0.14% [95% CI, -0.34% to 0.07%]; HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.72 to 1.08]).14 The WHI trial also did not find any statistically significant difference in total fractures (ARD, -0.35% [95% CI, -1.02% to 0.31%]; HR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.91 to 1.02]) or clinical vertebral fractures (ARD, -0.09% [95% CI, -0.30% to 0.12%]; HR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.74 to 1.10]). However, this trial allowed participants to use calcium and vitamin D supplements outside of the study protocol, which may have biased results toward a null effect. The other, much smaller trial (n=445) evaluated 700 IU of vitamin D with 500 mg of calcium daily compared with placebo and did not find any significant difference in hip fractures (ARD, -0.50% [95% CI, -1.88% to 0.78%]; RR, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.01 to 8.78]). This trial found a reduction in nonvertebral fractures with vitamin D and calcium supplementation, which was one of its primary aims (ARD, -6.99% [95% CI, -12.71% to -1.27%]; RR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.23 to 0.90]).32
Potential Harms of Preventive Medication
The USPSTF evaluated evidence from 9 RCTs on the harms of vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation.1, 26 Four studies reported on harms of vitamin D supplementation alone (n=10,599) (the same 4 studies mentioned previously), 3 studies reported on the harms of calcium supplementation alone (n=1292), and 3 studies (including 1 of the studies reporting on harms of calcium supplementation alone) reported on harms of combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation (n=39,659). One study was conducted in men only, and 3 other studies included men (total of 5991 men across studies). The mean age of study participants ranged from 53 to 80 years. In the 4 studies that reported race/ethnicity, 83% to 100% of study participants were white; the remaining 5 studies did not report this information. Four of the studies were conducted in the United States; the other 5 studies were conducted in Finland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand (2 studies). The USPSTF particularly sought evidence on the outcomes of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and kidney stones.1
Vitamin D, with or without calcium, had no statistically significant effect on all-cause mortality or incident cardiovascular disease compared with placebo. Four studies (n=10,599) reported on mortality outcomes with vitamin D supplementation alone; the pooled ARD was -0.74% (95% CI, -0.80% to 0.32%), and the pooled RR was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.82 to 1.01). Two studies reported on mortality outcomes with combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation, including the large WHI trial; ARDs were -0.19% and -0.36%, with 95% CIs spanning the null effect. However, none of these studies were adequately powered to detect mortality differences. Three studies reported on incident cardiovascular outcomes with vitamin D supplementation, including 1 good-quality study (n=5110) in which cardiovascular disease incidence was the primary outcome.16, 17 Various outcomes were reported, including ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and stroke. ARDs ranged from -0.72% to 1.79%, with all 95% CIs spanning the null effect. The WHI trial also reported on incident cardiovascular outcomes with combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation and found no significant increase in myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or hospitalizations for heart failure; ARDs ranged from -0.16% to 0.12%, with all 95% CIs including zero. The evidence on calcium supplementation alone suggested no increased incidence of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular disease but was limited to 1 study.33
Evidence on the effects of vitamin D or calcium supplementation alone on cancer incidence was inconsistent and imprecise. Combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation did not increase cancer incidence; the pooled ARD from 3 RCTs (n=39,213) was -1.5% (95% CI, -3.3% to 0.4%).
Calcium supplementation alone for 2 to 4 years did not increase the incidence of kidney stones; the pooled ARD from 3 RCTs (n=1259) was 0.00% (95% CI, -0.88% to 0.87%), and the pooled RR was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.14 to 3.40). Based on evidence from 3 RCTs (n=39,659), combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation for 4 to 7 years increased the incidence of kidney stones; the pooled ARD was 0.33% (95% CI, 0.06% to 0.60%), and the pooled RR was 1.18 (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.35).
The most commonly reported other adverse event associated with supplementation was constipation; however, this was not consistently reported across studies. A few studies reported on other serious adverse events, but these events were rare and noted by the authors to be unrelated to the study medication. In a separate evidence review commissioned by the USPSTF on interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults,19 1 study (n=2256) reported an increase in the number of persons experiencing a fall with a very high dose of vitamin D (500,000 IU per year) (adjusted incident rate ratio, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.03 to 1.31]).19, 34
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to estimate the benefits of vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation to prevent fractures in community-dwelling men and premenopausal women. The USPSTF concludes that there is insufficient evidence to estimate the net benefit of vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation to prevent fractures in community-dwelling men and premenopausal women. Because of the lack of effect on fracture incidence and the increased incidence of kidney stones in intervention groups, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that daily supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calcium has no net benefit for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal women. Although women enrolled in the WHI trial were predominately white, the lower risk for fractures in nonwhite women makes it very unlikely that a benefit would exist in this population. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on calcium supplementation alone, as well as on supplementation with doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D and greater than 1000 mg of calcium in postmenopausal women. The USPSTF concludes that there is insufficient evidence to estimate the net benefit of supplementation with doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D and greater than 1000 mg of calcium in postmenopausal women.
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
Calcium contributes to bone growth, and vitamin D helps bones absorb calcium. Normal, healthy bones turn over calcium constantly, replacing calcium loss with new calcium. The human body has 2 main sources of vitamin D. Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), the larger source of vitamin D, is synthesized in the skin by UVB rays from the sun. Vitamin D3 is converted to its active form through enzymatic processes in the liver and kidney. Ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) is consumed in the diet and can be found naturally in a few foods, such as mushrooms and egg yolks, but is more commonly consumed as a supplement or in fortified foods and beverages, such as milk, yogurt, and orange juice.35 Most cells contain specific receptors for the active form of vitamin D. Stimulation of skeletal muscle receptors promotes protein synthesis, and vitamin D has a beneficial effect on muscle strength and balance. Vitamin D controls calcium absorption in the small intestines, interacts with parathyroid hormone to help maintain calcium homeostasis between the blood and bones, and is essential for bone growth and maintaining bone density. Obtaining insufficient amounts of vitamin D through diet or sun exposure can lead to inadequate levels of the hormone calcitriol (the active form of vitamin D), which in turn can lead to impaired absorption of dietary calcium. Consequently, the body uses calcium from skeletal stores, which can weaken existing bones.
The current recommendation against supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures is primarily based on the finding of no benefit with supplementation at lower doses. More evidence is needed to determine whether higher doses of supplementation may be more effective at preventing fractures. Although the risk for kidney stones could theoretically increase at higher doses of supplementation, the overall determination of net benefit or net harm will depend on whether a benefit in fracture prevention is also found at higher doses and, if so, what the magnitude of that benefit is.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from September 26, 2017, to October 24, 2017. To clarify which population the recommendation applies to, the USPSTF revised the title to “Vitamin D, Calcium, or Combined Supplementation for the Primary Prevention of Fractures in Community-Dwelling Adults.” Some comments expressed concern that the recommendation against supplementation with vitamin D would be misinterpreted by persons with known osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency. Persons with known osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency were excluded from the evidence review, and thus are excluded from the recommendation statement, as described in the “Summary of Recommendations and Evidence” and “Patient Population Under Consideration” sections. Other comments requested clarification of the role of vitamin D in persons with known osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency. This is beyond the scope of the recommendation and has been clarified in the “Scope of Review” section. Some comments also expressed confusion over why a finding of “insufficient evidence” was issued for supplementation at higher doses if the USPSTF recommends against supplementation at lower doses. The recommendation against supplementation at lower doses was based on an overall assessment that supplementation at low doses provides no benefit. Evidence on the effect of supplementation on fractures at higher doses is conflicting, with some studies showing a reduction in certain fracture types at higher doses, and others showing no reduction or even an increase. More studies are needed to more clearly determine if supplementation with vitamin D, calcium, or both consistently prevents fractures. If future evidence shows a benefit, the magnitude of that benefit will need to be weighed against the magnitude of harms caused by supplementation (kidney stones).","<h3>Importance</h3>

"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women aged 35 years or older without a prior diagnosis of breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). Neither tamoxifen nor raloxifene should be used in women who have a history of thromboembolic events (deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, stroke, or transient ischemic attack). The USPSTF has issued separate recommendations for women with BRCA gene mutations (available at <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).<a name=""risk""></a>
<h3>Assessment of Breast Cancer Risk</h3>
If a family history of breast cancer or a personal history of breast biopsy is found during the usual patient assessment, clinicians may consider further evaluation using a breast cancer risk assessment tool. Risk assessment tools specifically for family history of breast cancer are available elsewhere (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>). The National Cancer Institute has developed a Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (available at <a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool"">www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool</a>) that is based on the Gail model and estimates the 5-year incidence of invasive breast cancer in women on the basis of characteristics entered into a risk calculator. This tool helps identify women who may be at increased risk for the disease. Other risk assessment models have been developed by the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC), Rosner and Colditz, Chlebowski, Tyrer and Cuzick, and others. Examples of risk factors elicited by risk assessment tools include patient age, race or ethnicity, age at menarche, age at first live childbirth, personal history of DCIS or LCIS, number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer, personal history of breast biopsy, body mass index, menopause status or age, breast density, estrogen and progestin use, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, and diet. These models are not recommended for use in women with a personal history of breast cancer, a history of radiation treatment to the chest, or a possible family history of mutations in the <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> genes. Only a small fraction of women are at increased risk for breast cancer. Most who are at increased risk will not develop the disease, and most cases will arise in women who are not identified as being at increased risk. Risk assessment should be repeated when there is a significant change in breast cancer risk factors. There is no single cutoff for defining increased risk. Most clinical trials defined increased risk as a 5-year risk for invasive breast cancer of 1.66% or greater, as determined by the BCPT (Breast Cancer Prevention Trial). At this cutoff, however, many women would not have a net benefit from risk-reducing medications. Freedman and colleagues&nbsp;developed risk tables that incorporate the BCPT estimate of a woman's breast cancer risk as well as her age, race or ethnicity, and presence of uterus. On the basis of the Freedman risk&ndash;benefit tables for women aged 50 years or older (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/breastcanmeds/breastcanmedsrs4figs.htm"">Figures 2 to 5</a>), the USPSTF concludes that many women with an estimated 5-year breast cancer risk of 3% or greater are likely to have more benefit than harm from using tamoxifen or raloxifene, although the balance depends on age, race or ethnicity, the medication used, and whether the patient has a uterus.
<h3>Assessment of Risk for Adverse Effects</h3>
In general, women taking medications for breast cancer risk reduction are less likely to experience a VTE if they are younger and have no other predisposition to thromboembolic events. Women with a personal or family history of venous thromboembolism are at higher risk for these adverse effects.Women without a uterus are not at risk for tamoxifen-related endometrial cancer. Women with a uterus should have a baseline gynecologic examination prior to starting tamoxifen, with regular followup after the end of treatment.
<h3>Medications for Breast Cancer Risk Reduction</h3>
Selective estrogen receptor modulators (tamoxifen and raloxifene) have been shown to reduce the incidence of invasive breast cancer in several randomized, controlled trials. Tamoxifen has been approved for this use in women aged 35 years or older, and raloxifene has been approved for this use in postmenopausal women.The usual daily doses for tamoxifen and raloxifene are 20 mg and 60 mg, respectively, for 5 years. Aromatase inhibitors (exemestane) have not been approved by the FDA for this indication and are therefore beyond the scope of this recommendation.Tamoxifen is not recommended for use in combination with hormone therapy or hormonal contraception or in women who are pregnant, those who may become pregnant, or breastfeeding mothers.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
The USPSTF recommendation on risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA-related cancer can be found at <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>. Clinical trials of tamoxifen and raloxifene have not been conducted specifically in women who are BRCA mutation carriers.
<h3>Other Resources</h3>
The National Cancer Institute provides information about potential ways to prevent cancer, including lifestyle and diet changes (available at <a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/prevention/breast/Patient"">www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/prevention/breast/Patient</a> and <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/basic_info/prevention.htm"">www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/basic_info/prevention.htm</a>). The USPSTF does not endorse any particular risk prediction model. However, the BCPT model (<a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool"">www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool</a>) and the BCSC model (<a href=""https://tools.bcsc-scc.org/BC5yearRisk"">https://tools.bcsc-scc.org/BC5yearRisk</a>) can be used by clinicians and patients as part of the process of shared, informed decision making. Both models have been calibrated in U.S. populations.<a name=""other""></a>
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
In order to identify patients for whom the potential benefits of risk-reducing medications could outweigh potential risks, clinicians should first identify patients who may be at increased risk for breast cancer (see <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/breastcanmeds/breastcanmedsrs.htm#risk"">Assessment of Breast Cancer Risk</a>).  Clinicians may use this opportunity to educate all women about their risk for developing breast cancer; studies have shown that women tend to overestimate their individual breast cancer risk. For women whose 5-year projected risk for breast cancer is 3% or greater, clinicians should identify those for whom the potential benefits of risk-reducing medications may outweigh the potential risks. In doing so, clinicians should consider the woman's age, comorbid conditions, presence of uterus, and risks for thromboembolic or medication-related adverse events. Clinicians may refer to risk&ndash;benefit tables to complement clinical assessment (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/breastcanmeds/breastcanmedsrs4figs.htm"">Figures 2-5</a>).Clinicians should clearly discuss the potential benefits and risks of risk-reducing medications with women for whom the former may outweigh the latter. Clinicians should then strive to ensure that patients make a fully informed decision that incorporates their personal values and preferences, including their concerns about breast cancer and specific medication-related adverse events.
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Research to improve the ability to assess and accurately predict a woman's chance of developing breast cancer over a defined period is needed. The ideal candidates for risk-reducing medications are women who have not only a high probability of developing breast cancer over a defined period but also a low probability of thromboembolic and other medication-related adverse events. Models that can more precisely predict both of these events should be developed. Clinical trials that provide more information about the safety and effectiveness of other medications for breast cancer risk reduction, such as aromatase inhibitors and tibolone, are needed. The aromatase inhibitor exemestane reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women who were at moderately increased risk for the disease. There were no significant differences in the incidence of osteoporosis, cardiovascular events, other types of cancer, or death. However, these findings were reported from a randomized, clinical trial with a median follow-up of 3 years and will require long-term assessment. IBIS-II (International Breast Cancer Intervention Study II), an ongoing British study, is comparing the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole with placebo in women who are at increased risk for breast cancer. Additional research could help clarify the optimum treatment duration, timing, and dose. Future studies should examine the benefits and harms of risk-reducing medications in racially diverse patient populations.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/breastcanmeds/breastcanmedsrs.htm#consider,133,"In 2013, the American Society of Clinical Oncology recommended that tamoxifen should be discussed as an option to reduce risk for ER-positive breast cancer in women aged 35 years or older who are at increased risk for breast cancer. It also recommended that raloxifene and exemestane should be discussed as options for breast cancer risk reduction in postmenopausal women. In 2013, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended that clinicians offer tamoxifen or raloxifene for 5 years to postmenopausal women with a uterus who are at high risk for breast cancer unless they have a history of or may be at increased risk for thromboembolic disease or endometrial cancer. The guideline also included recommendations for different age and risk groups. In 2011, the American Cancer Society recommended that women who are considering medications for breast cancer risk reduction should discuss their personal health situations with their physicians. In 2001, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommended that women who are at high risk for breast cancer should receive counseling about the risks and benefits of tamoxifen for cancer prevention; it found fair evidence to recommend against the use of tamoxifen in women who are at low or normal risk for breast cancer.","Burden of Disease
Breast cancer is the most common nonskin cancer in women. According to the National Cancer Institute, 12.4% (1 in 8) women born today will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime10. Between 2005 and 2009, the median age at breast cancer diagnosis was 61 years, and the median age at death from the disease was 68 years. The age-adjusted mortality rate was 23.0 deaths per 100,000 women per year, with higher mortality rates among African American women (31.6 deaths per 100,000 women per year)10.
Scope of Review
The USPSTF reviewed evidence on the effectiveness, adverse effects, and subgroup variations of medications to reduce the risk for breast cancer—specifically, the selective estrogen receptor modulators tamoxifen and raloxifene5-7. The USPSTF reviewed randomized trials, observational studies, and diagnostic accuracy studies of risk stratification models in women without preexisting breast cancer, precursor conditions, or known breast cancer susceptibility mutations. The USPSTF also reviewed a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials to understand the relative benefits and harms of tamoxifen and raloxifene7.
Effectiveness of Risk Assessment
To understand the effectiveness of breast cancer risk assessment, the USPSTF reviewed 13 breast cancer risk assessment models that can be used in primary care. The original Gail model, the first to be used clinically, includes age, age at menarche, age at first childbirth, family history of breast cancer in first-degree relatives, number of prior breast biopsies, and history of atypical hyperplasia. Expanding on the Gail model, newer models include race or ethnicity, prior false-positive mammography results or benign breast disease, body mass index or height, estrogen and progestin use, history of breastfeeding, menopause status or age, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, education, breast density, and diet. Several models have been tested in large U.S. populations in studies that received good quality ratings but reported only modest accuracy. The BCSC Barlow model was derived from more than 11,638 breast cancer cases that developed among a cohort of almost 2.4 million women11. The Rosner–Colditz model was derived from 1761 breast cancer cases that developed among 58,520 participants in the Nurses' Health Study12. Chlebowski and colleagues developed a model based on 3236 cases that developed in the Women's Health Initiative study13. Breast cancer risk assessment models from Italy and the United Kingdom were also based on large populations but were not tested in the United States.
All models predicted probabilities of breast cancer that were in general agreement with observed risk. Models had the best calibration in women older than 60 years, those who received annual breast cancer screening, and those with ER-positive breast cancer. However, most had a false-positive rate of 55% to 66%, indicating modest accuracy in predicting risk for individuals.
Information about the validity, feasibility, and effect of using risk assessment models to identify appropriate candidates for risk-reducing medications in primary care settings is limited2-4.
Effectiveness of Risk-Reducing Medications
To understand the effectiveness of risk-reducing medications for breast cancer, the USPSTF reviewed 7 large randomized, controlled trials of breast cancer outcomes in women without preexisting breast cancer5-7. Other relevant study outcomes included death, fractures, thromboembolic events, cardiovascular disease events, uterine abnormalities, cataracts, and other adverse effects.
STAR (Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene) was a head-to-head comparison of tamoxifen versus raloxifene with more than 9800 patients in each study group14, 15. Four studies compared tamoxifen with placebo: NSABP-1 (National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project)16-19, IBIS-I20, 21, the Royal Marsden Hospital trial22, 23, and the Italian Tamoxifen Prevention Study24-27. Two studies compared raloxifene with placebo: the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation study, with long-term follow-up in the Continuing Outcomes Relevant to Evista study28-41, and the Raloxifene Use for the Heart trial42, 43. These were all multicenter trials that were relevant to primary care. They enrolled between 2471 and 19,747 women, predominantly in North America, Europe, and the United Kingdom. All trials met criteria for fair or good quality as well as high applicability to the U.S. primary care population.
For STAR, eligibility criteria included having a 5-year predicted breast cancer risk of 1.66% or greater; median follow-up was 81 months15. For the placebo-controlled trials involving tamoxifen, eligibility criteria and duration of follow-up varied. Eligibility criteria for NSABP-1 included having a 5-year predicted breast cancer risk of 1.66% or greater, and median follow-up was about 7 years16. Eligibility criteria for IBIS-I included having an estimated 10-year risk of 5% or greater; median follow-up was 96 months21. For the Royal Marsden Hospital23 and Italian Tamoxifen Prevention27 trials, eligibility criteria did not include a prespecified breast cancer risk threshold, and median follow-up was 13 and 11 years, respectively. For placebo-controlled trials involving raloxifene (Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation and Continuing Outcomes Relevant to Evista), eligibility criteria did not include a prespecified breast cancer risk threshold; together, these trials provided 8 years of follow-up39.
In placebo-controlled trials, tamoxifen and raloxifene significantly reduced the risk for invasive breast cancer (tamoxifen RR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.59 to 0.82]16, 21, 23, 26, 39; raloxifene RR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.27 to 0.71]39, 42. In STAR, tamoxifen reduced breast cancer more than raloxifene (raloxifene RR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.05 to 1.47])14.
Both medications reduced breast cancer in all subgroups studied, although trial data for racial subgroups were not available. Tamoxifen reduced breast cancer outcomes in subgroups based on age, menopausal status, estrogen use, family history of breast cancer, and history of LCIS or atypical ductal hyperplasia. In NSABP-1, tamoxifen was most effective in preventing invasive breast cancer in high-risk groups, including women with LCIS, atypical ductal hyperplasia, the highest Gail risk scores, and the greatest number of relatives with breast cancer16. Raloxifene reduced breast cancer outcomes in subgroups based on age, age at menarche, parity, age at first live childbirth, and body mass index. Effect estimates for raloxifene were limited by small sample size for subgroups based on prior estrogen use, family history of breast cancer, and prior hysterectomy or oophorectomy. Specific risk factors may be more useful than risk calculators in certain clinical settings.
Both medications reduced breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women. Tamoxifen also reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer in premenopausal women who were at increased risk for the disease. Risk reduction with tamoxifen was greatest in women with 3 or more first-degree relatives with breast cancer, LCIS, or atypical hyperplasia.
Reduction of invasive breast cancer continued for at least 3 to 5 years after discontinuation of tamoxifen in the 2 trials providing posttreatment follow-up data. Neither medication significantly reduced the risk for ER-negative breast cancer, noninvasive breast cancer, or all-cause mortality. In the placebo-controlled trials and STAR, raloxifene reduced vertebral fractures (RR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.69])32.42, whereas tamoxifen reduced nonvertebral fractures (RR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.98])17. Tamoxifen and raloxifene had similar effects on vertebral fractures in STAR44.
The USPSTF could not assess the effect of these medications on mortality attributed to breast cancer or other causes. The effects of tamoxifen and raloxifene on mortality were not statistically significant in the clinical trials, which did not have sufficient long-term follow-up for this outcome. Although there is convincing evidence that these medications can reduce the incidence of invasive breast cancer (predominantly ER-positive cancer), whether reductions in breast cancer incidence lead to a corresponding reduction in mortality is unclear.
The USPSTF also considered meta-analysis summary calculations of the number of events reduced per 1000 women in placebo-controlled trials, assuming 5 years of treatment (Table)7. Both medications reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer, with 7 fewer events per 1000 women for tamoxifen (4 trials) and 9 fewer events per 1000 women for raloxifene (2 trials). When compared head-to-head in STAR, tamoxifen reduced breast cancer incidence by 5 more events per 1000 women than raloxifene. Compared with placebo, raloxifene reduced the incidence of vertebral fractures by 7 events per 1000 women (2 trials), whereas tamoxifen reduced the incidence of nonvertebral fractures by 3 events per 1000 women (1 trial). There were no significant differences in vertebral fractures when the drugs were compared head-to-head in STAR.
Potential Harms of Risk Assessment and Preventive Medication
No studies reported on the potential harms of breast cancer risk assessment in primary care settings. Clinical trials provided evidence on the potential harms of tamoxifen and raloxifene5-7. Study outcomes included thromboembolic events, uterine abnormalities, cardiovascular disease events, cataracts, and other adverse effects.
In most trials, both tamoxifen and raloxifene nearly doubled the risk for all VTEs compared with placebo (tamoxifen RR, 1.93 [95% CI, 1.41 to 2.64]17, 21, 23, 24; raloxifene RR, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.15 to 2.23]42, 45. Tamoxifen increased risk for VTEs more than raloxifene in STAR. Risk returned to normal after discontinuation of tamoxifen in the 2 trials providing posttreatment data.
Compared with placebo, tamoxifen was associated with more cases of endometrial cancer (RR, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.36 to 3.32])17, 21, 23; more benign gynecologic conditions21.46; surgical procedures, including hysterectomy21, 23, 46; and uterine bleeding21, 46. Women without a uterus are not at increased risk for tamoxifen-related endometrial cancer. Raloxifene did not increase risk for endometrial cancer or uterine bleeding. In STAR, raloxifene was associated with fewer cases of endometrial cancer than tamoxifen (RR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.36 to 0.83])14.
Tamoxifen and raloxifene did not increase risk for coronary heart disease events or stroke16, 21, 23, 26, 28, 42. However, in 1 trial that was specifically designed to ascertain cardiovascular outcomes in postmenopausal women who had or were at increased risk for coronary heart disease, stroke mortality was higher with raloxifene than placebo (absolute increase, 0.7 events per 1000 women per year)42.
Compared with women receiving placebo, those receiving tamoxifen more frequently had cataract surgery in 1 trial17, although cataract risk was not increased in a meta-analysis of 3 tamoxifen trials (RR, 1.25 [95% CI, 0.93 to 1.67])16, 21, 23. Raloxifene did not increase risk for cataracts or cataract surgery compared with placebo42, 45 and caused fewer cataracts than tamoxifen in STAR14.
The most commonly reported adverse effects in these trials were vasomotor symptoms and vaginal discharge, itching, or dryness for tamoxifen and vasomotor symptoms and leg cramps for raloxifene. In STAR, raloxifene users reported more musculoskeletal problems, dyspareunia, and weight gain, whereas tamoxifen users had more gynecologic problems, vasomotor symptoms, leg cramps, and bladder control symptoms.
The USPSTF also considered meta-analysis summary calculations of the number of adverse health events per 1000 women caused by these medications in placebo-controlled trials, assuming 5 years of treatment (Table)7. Tamoxifen was associated with 4 VTEs per 1000 women (4 trials), whereas raloxifene was associated with 7 VTEs per 1000 women (2 trials). Tamoxifen increased thromboembolic events by 4 more events per 1000 women than raloxifene in STAR. Tamoxifen was also associated with 4 cases of endometrial cancer per 1000 women (3 trials).
Risk Perception and Decision Making
In studies describing how women decide whether to take medications to reduce risk for primary breast cancer, women had substantial concerns about potential serious adverse events, especially when they were informed of the medications' risks and benefits. In 1 study of women who were at increased risk for breast cancer, only 12% selected tamoxifen for risk reduction; most (77%) declined, primarily because of concerns about serious adverse events and small therapeutic benefit3. Women who were interested in receiving risk-reducing medications often overestimated their own risk for breast cancer (that is, erroneously thought they were at high risk). Women placed great emphasis on recommendations from their physicians.
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
One breast cancer risk model found that for many women with an increased 5-year risk for breast cancer, the benefits of risk-reducing medication outweigh the potential harms (Figures 1-4)8. Whether there is a net benefit depends on a woman's risk for breast cancer, age, and race and whether she has a uterus. Accordingly, the USPSTF's recommendations are different for women with low risk for breast cancer than for those with high risk.
The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that medications to reduce risk for breast cancer confer moderate net benefit in women who are at increased risk for the disease. Tamoxifen is associated with moderate benefit, with adequate evidence for risk reduction of invasive breast cancer. Raloxifene is associated with slightly smaller benefit for breast cancer risk reduction but no risk for endometrial cancer. The USPSTF found adequate evidence of small benefit for reduction of nonvertebral fractures with tamoxifen, whereas raloxifene reduces vertebral fractures.
The USPSTF found adequate evidence of small to moderate risk for medication-associated VTEs (depending on age), as well as small to moderate risk for medication-associated endometrial cancer with tamoxifen (depending on hysterectomy status and age).
The USPSTF concludes that both tamoxifen and raloxifene confer a benefit no greater than small, with moderate harms, for women who are not at increased risk for breast cancer.
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
Tamoxifen and raloxifene are selective estrogen receptor modulators. Because ER-positive cancer is believed to be more amenable to therapy than ER-negative cancer, these medications would not prevent the type of breast cancer that is most difficult to treat.
Response to Public Comments
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 16 April through 13 May 2013. In response to public comment and in consideration of FDA-approved indications, the USPSTF provided more information about the target patient population for this recommendation. The USPSTF clarified that the recommendation applies to asymptomatic women aged 35 years or older without a prior diagnosis of breast cancer, DCIS, or LCIS. The final recommendation statement further clarifies that raloxifene has been approved for breast cancer risk reduction in postmenopausal women and that other groups of women should not use tamoxifen. The USPSTF reiterated that only a small fraction of women are candidates for and would derive benefit from risk-reducing medications.
The USPSTF also provided a more comprehensive list of breast cancer risk factors and links to additional resources in response to comments, as well as summary tables to help readers understand the risk–benefit balance of these medications, links to online breast cancer risk assessment models, and updated recommendations of other groups.",,Medications for Risk Reduction of Primary Breast Cancer in Women,"Breast Cancer, Preventive Medications, 2013"
"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation statement applies to asymptomatic adults who do not recognize or report respiratory symptoms. It does not apply to at-risk persons who present to clinicians with symptoms such as chronic cough, sputum production, dyspnea, or wheezing. It also does not apply to persons with a family history of &alpha;1-antitrypsin deficiency.
<h3>Risk Assessment</h3>
Exposure to cigarette smoke or toxic fumes increases the risk for COPD. Epidemiological studies have found that 15% to 50% of smokers develop COPD.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation3"">3</a> More than 70% of all COPD cases occur in current or former smokers. Occupational exposure to toxins, dusts, or industrial chemicals contributes an estimated 15% of all COPD cases. Environmental pollution, including wood smoke and traffic pollutants, is also associated with increased risk for COPD. Nonmodifiable risk factors for COPD include history of asthma or childhood respiratory tract infections and &alpha;1-antitrypsin deficiency.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Screening adults in primary care involves either risk assessment via a formal prescreening questionnaire and, if positive, follow-up with diagnostic spirometry testing or screening spirometry administered without a bronchodilator and, if positive, follow-up with diagnostic spirometry testing. Patients identified as high risk by a prescreening questionnaire or screening spirometry are referred for diagnostic spirometry testing. Diagnosis by spirometry requires persistent airway obstruction after administration of an inhaled bronchodilator, such as albuterol (ie, postbronchodilator spirometry). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is diagnosed when the patient has a postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 0.70. Severity is defined by the percentage of predicted postbronchodilator FEV1; 80% or more is mild, 50% to 79% is moderate, 30% to 49% is severe, and less than 30% is very severe.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
Prevention of exposure to cigarette smoke and other toxic fumes is the best way to prevent COPD.&nbsp; Interventions to prevent the initiation of tobacco use are an effective way to prevent exposure to cigarette smoke. Current smokers should receive smoking cessation counseling and be offered behavioral and pharmacological therapies to stop smoking.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The USPSTF recommends that clinicians ask all adults, including pregnant women, about tobacco use and provide tobacco cessation interventions for those who use tobacco products. The USPSTF also recommends that clinicians provide interventions, including education or brief counseling, to prevent initiation of tobacco use in school-aged children and adolescents. These recommendations and their supporting evidence are available on the USPSTF website (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).",,164,"In 2011, the American College of Physicians, American College of Chest Physicians, American Thoracic Society, and European Respiratory Society issued joint guidelines recommending that spirometry be used to diagnose airflow obstruction in patients with respiratory symptoms.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation16"">16</a> The joint panel recommended against screening for COPD with spirometry in asymptomatic patients, citing the lack of benefit. Similarly, in 2010, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended against screening for COPD in asymptomatic patients.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation17"">17</a> Recent guidelines from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease recommended case-finding in symptomatic patients but did not recommend screening in asymptomatic populations.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation18"">18</a>","Burden of Disease
About 13.7 million US adults are affected annually by COPD.4 As lung function deteriorates over time, patients with COPD experience significant restrictions in their ability to work and participate in other activities of daily living. In 2013, COPD was responsible for about 10.3 million physician visits and 1.5 million emergency department visits.4 Health care costs associated with COPD are an estimated $32 billion per year.3 The prevalence of COPD and its associated mortality have been rising among women, possibly due to increasing smoking rates, environmental exposures, or biological mechanisms that increase susceptibility to COPD. Among different racial/ethnic groups, the prevalence of COPD is highest among non-Hispanic white individuals (14.9%) and non-Hispanic black individuals (12.8%).2, 5
Scope of Review
Since the 2008 USPSTF recommendation, there is still no evidence that screening for COPD in asymptomatic persons improves health-related quality of life, morbidity, or mortality. The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to examine whether screening for COPD improves the delivery and uptake of targeted preventive services, such as smoking cessation or relevant immunizations. In addition to the potential benefits of screening, the USPSTF also examined the possible harms of screening for and treatment of mild to moderate COPD. The diagnostic accuracy of screening tools (including prescreening questionnaires and spirometry) was not part of the previous systematic review but was evaluated in the current review.3, 6
Accuracy of Prescreening and Screening Tests
The USPSTF identified 3 externally validated questionnaires based on risk factors, symptoms, or both: the COPD Diagnostic Questionnaire,7, 8 the Lung Function Questionnaire,9 and the COPD Population Screener.10 In addition, 3 other questionnaires are currently in development but have not yet been externally validated.3 The COPD Diagnostic Questionnaire is an 8-item questionnaire; using a cutoff of greater than 16.5, it has a sensitivity of about 90% and specificity of about 40% for identifying persons with COPD in a primary care population.3 The Lung Function Questionnaire is a 5-item questionnaire; using a cutoff of 18 or greater, it has a sensitivity of approximately 88% and specificity of approximately 25% in a primary care population of current and former smokers.3 The COPD Population Screener is a 5-item questionnaire; using a cutoff of 4 or greater, it has a sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 73% in a general population in Japan.3
The USPSTF found 2 heterogeneous international studies of screening with handheld peak flow meters that were not considered applicable to a US primary care population.3 Screening with pulmonary function tests (without bronchodilators) was studied in primary care populations in Australia and Sweden3 and yielded sensitivity of about 50% and specificity of 90% for a cutoff of less than 0.70. Another screening study conducted in Greece evaluated postbronchodilator spirometry and yielded sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 95% for the same cutoff.3 The USPSTF found no pulmonary function screening studies conducted in the United States.3
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment
The USPSTF found no studies that directly assessed the effects of screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults on morbidity, mortality, or health-related quality of life. The USPSTF also found no studies that examined the effectiveness of screening on relevant immunization rates. The USPSTF identified 5 studies that assessed the effects of screening on smoking cessation.11-15 These studies primarily examined the incremental value of adding spirometry testing to existing smoking cessation programs. One trial showed a statistically significant increase in smoking cessation rates between participants who received explanations of their spirometry results using “lung age” and those who did not.11 The other 4 trials did not report any significant differences in smoking abstinence rates.
The USPSTF examined the treatment efficacy of 4 classes of medications used to treat COPD: long-acting β-agonists (LABAs), inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting anticholinergics (tiotropium), and combination therapy with corticosteroids and LABAs.3 No treatment trials were conducted in asymptomatic or screen-detected populations; all were conducted in populations with moderate COPD. Two studies of LABAs found no difference in all-cause mortality but found decreased exacerbation of COPD symptoms in the treatment vs control group in post hoc subanalysis. Decreased exacerbation of COPD symptoms was reported for patients with moderate to severe symptoms of COPD. However, rates of COPD exacerbation were extremely low at baseline (<1 episode per year), even among participants reporting symptoms. Six trials of inhaled corticosteroids found decreased exacerbation of COPD symptoms but no difference in all-cause mortality, dyspnea, or quality of life. One trial of combination therapy with corticosteroids and LABAs found decreased exacerbation of COPD symptoms but no differences in mortality or quality of life. Five trials of anticholinergics found decreased exacerbation of COPD symptoms but insufficient evidence on other outcomes. For all classes of medications, the one consistent finding was that treatment decreases exacerbation of COPD symptoms in persons with moderate COPD but has no consistent effects on all-cause mortality, dyspnea, or quality of life. There was insufficient evidence on the effects of treatment on exercise capacity and functional status.
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The potential harms of using prescreening questionnaires and screening spirometry are false-positive and false-negative results. The USPSTF found no evidence to estimate the short- or long-term harms of these screening tests. Potential harms of treatment include pneumonia with use of LABAs and inhaled corticosteroids and decreased bone density and increased fractures with use of inhaled corticosteroids. However, data were sparse, with few adverse events, and there were no differences between the intervention and control groups.3
Because all of the treatment trials were conducted in persons with mild to moderate COPD, it is unclear how these results would apply to asymptomatic populations. The potential treatment benefit of decreased exacerbation of symptoms may not apply to patients who report no symptoms to begin with. Given the lack of potential benefits of treatment in asymptomatic persons and the not-trivial work of screening, the USPSTF determined that there is no net benefit of screening.
How Does the Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
To date, treatment trials of COPD have found modest treatment benefits in patients with mild to moderate COPD. Because the majority of COPD cases result from exposure to cigarette smoke and other toxic fumes, the most effective way to prevent COPD is to limit such exposure. Persons with a history of exposure and symptoms such as dyspnea, chronic cough, or sputum production should be evaluated for the diagnosis of COPD.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from August 18 to September 14, 2015. The USPSTF received requests for clarification about whether high-risk groups, such as current smokers, were included in the systematic review. In response, the USPSTF clarified that both current and former smokers were included in the studies reviewed. However, the lack of stratified results by smoking status limits the USPSTF’s ability to make a separate recommendation for screening in persons who are at higher risk for COPD. The USPSTF recognizes that patients who have mild COPD may underreport symptoms. The USPSTF encourages clinicians to offer smoking cessation interventions to all patients who currently smoke and to pursue active case-finding for COPD in patients with risk factors, such as exposure to cigarette smoke or heating fuels, occupational exposure to dusts or chemicals, or a family history of α1-antitrypsin deficiency.","<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>About 14% of US adults aged 40 to 79 years have COPD, and it is the third leading cause of death in the United States.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation1"">1</a>, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation2"">2</a>Persons with severe COPD are often unable to participate in normal physical activity due to deterioration of lung function.</p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is defined as airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lung to harmful particles or gases. Diagnosis is based on postbronchodilator spirometry, which detects fixed airway obstruction; a forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio of less than 0.70 is the current criterion for a positive COPD diagnosis. Persons with COPD often, but not always, have symptoms such as dyspnea (difficulty breathing or shortness of breath), chronic cough, and chronic sputum production. Patients often have a history of exposure to risk factors such as cigarette smoke or heating fuels or occupational exposure to dusts or chemicals. Although postbronchodilator spirometry is required to make a definitive diagnosis, prescreening questionnaires can elicit current symptoms and previous exposures to harmful particles or gases.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that screening for COPD in asymptomatic persons using questionnaires or spirometry improves health outcomes.</p>
<h3><strong>Harms of Detection and Early Treatment</strong></h3>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening. However, given the lack of benefit of early detection and treatment, the opportunity cost associated with screening asymptomatic persons may be large. The amount of time and effort required to screen for COPD in asymptomatic persons (using screening spirometry with or without prescreening questionnaires) is not trivial.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF determined that early detection of COPD, before the development of symptoms, does not alter the course of the disease or improve patient outcomes. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for COPD in asymptomatic persons has no net benefit. &nbsp;Thus, screening is not recommended in persons who do not have symptoms suggestive of COPD.&nbsp; The USPSTF recommends against screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults.</p>",Screening for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Screening, 2016"
"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to school-aged children and adolescents. The USPSTF has issued a separate recommendation statement on tobacco use counseling in adults and pregnant women.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
In 2009, 8.2% of middle school students and 23.9% of high school students reported current use of any tobacco product. Although younger children may be susceptible to smoking, research indicates that adolescents may be especially vulnerable to nicotine addiction.The prevalence of current smoking in the United States is higher in male high school students (19.8%) than female students (19.1%). Two of the strongest factors associated with smoking initiation in children and adolescents are parental smoking and parental nicotine dependence. Other factors include low levels of parental monitoring, easy access to cigarettes, the perception that peers smoke, and exposure to tobacco promotions.
<h3>Interventions to Prevent Tobacco Use</h3>
The type and intensity of effective behavioral interventions substantially varied in the evidence review, ranging from no in-person interaction with a health care professional to 7 group sessions totaling more than 15 hours (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/tobacco/tbacfinalrs.htm#ref1"">1</a>). In 1 intervention, families received a packet of materials for parents and children and a 28-minute video with a viewing guide. These families received 1 counseling call 3 to 6 weeks after receiving the written materials and another call 14 months after enrollment. Another intervention consisted of creating a tobacco-free office and giving patients a series of antitobacco messages on preprinted &ldquo;prescription&rdquo; forms. The most intensive intervention focused on universal substance abuse and problem behavior prevention for families. In this intervention, the youth and at least 1 parent participated in 7 group and family sessions over 7 weeks (each session lasted 2 to 2.5 hours) and received workbooks with activities to complete at home.Even very minimal interventions, such as mailing materials to a youth's home, had substantial effects on reducing smoking initiation. One intervention mailed tailored newsletters addressed to the student every 3 weeks; another intervention sent age-related materials 4 times over 12 months. In a third intervention, participants were mailed 5 core activity guides with newsletters and tip sheets approximately every 2 weeks, with 1 booster guide at 1 year.Many interventions had similar content, such as the participant's attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge about smoking; the consequences of smoking; the influence of the social environment, including tobacco marketing; and skills to decline cigarettes. Several interventions targeted parental attitudes and beliefs about smoking and parent&ndash;child communication.
<h3>Interventions for Tobacco Cessation</h3>
Evidence on the effectiveness of cessation interventions delivered in primary care settings to school-aged children and adolescents who have experimented with smoking or are regular smokers is limited. The USPSTF examined the evidence on behavioral interventions to promote smoking cessation in children and adolescents who were classified as smokers. Few studies targeted regular, established smokers or stratified findings by length or amount of smoking (such as experimenters vs. established smokers). A pooled meta-analysis of 7 trials, which included 2328 children and adolescents and examined interventions to promote smoking cessation, found a small but statistically insignificant effect at 6- to 12-month follow-up favoring the intervention (risk ratio, 0.96 [95 CI%, 0.90 to 1.02]).Although evidence on the effectiveness of primary care&ndash;relevant interventions in reducing smoking in children and adolescents is limited, some evidence from other literature shows that school- and community-based behavioral counseling programs can promote smoking cessation in adolescent smokers. In a meta-analysis of 64 trials, 40 of which were school-based, Sussman and Sun found a 4% difference in smoking cessation rates between the intervention and control groups (11.8% vs. 7.5%, respectively). A longitudinal evaluation of 41 community-based programs reported biochemically validated cessation rates similar to those in randomized trials (averaging 14% at the end of the program and 12% at 12-month follow-up).No medications are currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for tobacco cessation in children and adolescents. Two studies that evaluated behavioral interventions plus medication (sustained-release bupropion alone or combined with nicotine replacement therapy) showed no statistically significant benefit from the medication. Evidence on complementary and alternative medicine, such as acupuncture, for smoking cessation in children and adolescents is not available, and such interventions have demonstrated no long-term benefits in adults.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention and Cessation</h3>
The Community Preventive Services Task Force has made the following 4 recommendations for school-aged children and adolescents.<ol>
<li>Mobile phone&ndash;based interventions for tobacco cessation, on the basis of sufficient evidence of their effectiveness in increasing abstinence from tobacco among persons interested in quitting, as well as community-wide, proactive telephone support (proactive follow-up) combined with patient education materials, on the basis of strong evidence of their effectiveness in increasing tobacco cessation in both clinical and community settings. However, the Community Preventive Services Task Force noted that the evidence on the effectiveness of both of these interventions for school-aged children and adolescents is limited.</li>
<li>Interventions that increase the price of tobacco products, on the basis of strong evidence of their effectiveness in reducing tobacco use in adolescents and adults, reducing population consumption of tobacco products, and increasing tobacco use cessation.</li>
<li>Mass media campaigns, on the basis of strong evidence of their effectiveness in reducing tobacco use in adolescents when combined with increases in tobacco prices, school-based education, and other community education programs.</li>
<li>Community mobilization combined with additional interventions (such as stronger local laws directed at retailers, active enforcement of retailer sales laws, and retailer education with reinforcement), on the basis of sufficient evidence of their effectiveness in reducing youth tobacco use and access to tobacco products from commercial sources.</li>
</ol>The Community Preventive Services Task Force also recommends provider reminder systems, whether used alone or as part of a multicomponent intervention, across a range of intervention characteristics (such as chart stickers, checklists, and flowcharts) and in various clinical settings and populations.

It also recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant women about tobacco use and provide augmented, pregnancy-tailored counseling for those who smoke (A recommendation).",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/tobacco/tbacfinalrs.htm#clinical,131,"The 2008 update of the PHS clinical practice guidelines&nbsp;recommended that clinicians ask pediatric and adolescent patients about tobacco use and provide a strong message on the importance of total abstinence from tobacco use, provide counseling interventions to aid adolescent smokers in quitting smoking, and ask parents about tobacco use and offer them cessation advice and assistance to protect children from secondhand smoke. In 2009, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that all pediatricians counsel patients as young as 5 years against initiating tobacco use and provide counseling on tobacco cessation. The American Academy of Pediatrics also recommends that pediatricians advise all families to make their homes and cars smoke-free.","Burden of Disease

	Although purchasing tobacco products before the age of 18 years is illegal in the United States, 90% of American adults who have ever smoked on a daily basis reported that they smoked their first cigarette when they were younger than 18 years. Each day, more than 3800 children and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years smoke their first cigarette, and an estimated 1000 children and adolescents younger than 18 years begin smoking on a daily basis1. Although most serious health effects from smoking occur in adulthood, children and adolescents can have negative respiratory effects, including impaired lung growth; early onset of lung function decline; and respiratory- and asthma-related symptoms, such as coughing and wheezing.

	Scope of Review

	The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of primary care interventions on the rates of initiation or cessation of tobacco use in children and adolescents and on health outcomes, such as respiratory health, dental and oral health, and adult smoking. Included interventions targeted children, adolescents, or their parents; were delivered individually or in small groups in a health care or similar setting; had control groups that offered minimal or no treatment; and reported tobacco use prevalence or a similar outcome at least 6 months after the baseline assessment.

	The USPSTF also reviewed the evidence on the potential harms of these interventions. Although the review was designed to examine all forms of tobacco use (including chewing tobacco, hookah smoking, and other forms of tobacco), all of the trials focused primarily or exclusively on cigarette smoking1.

	Effectiveness of Interventions to Change Behavior

	No studies directly assessed the effectiveness of primary care–relevant interventions to prevent initiation of tobacco use on health outcomes in children and adolescents or subsequent rates of adult smoking. However, the USPSTF found 10 mostly fair-quality trials that included a behavior-based intervention to prevent smoking initiation in children and adolescents1. Six of these trials focused exclusively on smoking prevention, and 4 trials combined smoking prevention and cessation and reported results separately for nonsmokers and smokers. Two studies were conducted outside of the United States.

	The type and intensity of the interventions varied widely. Two studies were conducted in a primary care setting, and 2 were conducted in a dental setting. Six studies used primarily home-based interventions, including mailed materials and follow-up phone counseling. Interaction with a health provider ranged from 0 to more than 15 hours. Only the highest-intensity trial included group sessions and targeted multiple behaviors. Six of the 10 studies targeted youth directly, 3 included components for both youth and their parents, and 1 primarily targeted parents.

	Self-reported smoking initiation was the primary outcome in all of the studies. However, how the trials defined smoking status at baseline and posttest varied considerably. For example, 3 studies assessed the percentage of baseline nonsmokers (defined as never smoking—not even 1 puff) who reported ever smoking (even 1 puff) in the past 30 days at posttest. One study assessed the percentage of baseline nonusers (defined as 30-day tobacco use or having ever used tobacco more than 100 times) who reported tobacco use in the past 30 days at posttest. One study reported the percentage of baseline nonsmokers (no smoking in the past 30 days) who reported smoking 1 or more cigarettes in the past 30 days at posttest. Several studies did not report specific measures but reported the number of children or adolescents who started smoking at posttest.

	Because of the intermittent nature of smoking in children and adolescents, biochemical tests are not useful in substantiating self-reported smoking status in this population. No studies used biochemical measures to confirm self-reported measures.

	Results from a pooled meta-analysis of 9 trials (1 trial did not present adequate data and was excluded from the meta-analysis), which included 26,624 children and adolescents and examined smoking initiation in baseline nonsmokers, showed a statistically significant reduction in risk in youth who received the intervention at 6- to 36-month follow-up compared with the control group (risk ratio, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.70 to 0.93]). That is, behavior-based interventions reduced the absolute risk for smoking initiation at follow-up by 2%, resulting in a number needed to treat of 501.

	Potential Harms of Interventions to Change Behavior

	No trials directly addressed harms of interventions. A potential harm of intervention is the initiation of smoking. Some trials reported higher absolute prevalence of smoking in the intervention group compared with the control group at follow-up. However, no trials reported a statistically significant difference between the groups1.

	Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit

	Adequate evidence shows that individual and combination behavior-based interventions in primary care settings can reduce the risk for initiation of tobacco use in school-aged children and adolescents. Although evidence on harms of behavior-based interventions is insufficient, the USPSTF believes that the potential harms are small to none. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of behavior-based interventions to prevent smoking in children and adolescents is at least moderate.

	Response to Public Comments

	A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 11 December 2012 to 7 January 2013. Most comments agreed with the recommendation statement. In response to several comments requesting clarification, the USPSTF revised the title to reflect that the USPSTF considered primary care–relevant interventions, clarified that it searched for evidence on other forms of tobacco use but only found evidence on cigarette smoking, enhanced the section on research gaps, and provided resources for primary care clinicians to help prevent tobacco use in children and adolescents.",,Primary Care Interventions to Prevent Tobacco Use in Children and Adolescents,"Tobacco Use in Children & Adolescents, Primary Care Interventions, 2013"
"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to adults who do not have vision symptoms who are seen in a primary care setting.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
Increased IOP, family history of glaucoma, older age, and African American race increase a person's risk for open-angle glaucoma. Recent evidence shows that glaucoma may be increased in Hispanics. Older African Americans have a higher prevalence of glaucoma and perhaps a more rapid disease progression; if screening reduces vision impairment, then African Americans would probably have greater absolute benefit than whites.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Diagnosis of POAG is based on a combination of tests showing characteristic degenerative changes in the optic disc and defects in visual fields (often loss in peripheral vision). Although increased IOP was previously considered an important part of the definition of this condition, it is now known that many persons with POAG do not have increased IOP and not all persons with increased IOP have or will develop glaucoma. Therefore, screening with tonometry alone may be inadequate to detect all cases of POAG.Measurement of visual fields can be difficult. The reliability of a single measurement may be low; several consistent measurements are needed to establish the presence of defects. Specialists use dilated ophthalmoscopy or slit lamp examination to evaluate changes in the optic disc; however, even experts have varying ability to detect glaucomatous progression of the optic disc. In addition, no single standard exists to define and measure progression of visual field defects. Most tests that are available in a primary care setting do not have acceptable accuracy to detect glaucoma.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
The initial aim and efficacy assessment of primary treatments of POAG are reduction of IOP. Treatments include medication, laser therapy, and surgery. These treatments also effectively reduce the longer-term development and progression of small visual field defects as assessed by clinical examination. However, the magnitude of the effectiveness in reducing impairments in patient-reported, vision-related function, including development of blindness, is uncertain.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
Approximately 2.5 million persons in the United States have glaucoma, and approximately 1.9% of adults older than 40 years have open-angle glaucoma. Most persons with glaucoma have POAG. This condition is defined as optic neuropathy with a visibly open anterior chamber angle (between the iris and the anterior sclera or peripheral cornea) that is associated with progressive death of retinal ganglion cells and axons and visual field loss.The goal of screening programs is to identify and treat POAG before visual impairment develops. The proportion of persons who are currently unidentified and who will develop vision problems as a result of a diagnosis obtained through screening is not known. The natural history of glaucoma is heterogeneous and poorly defined.In some persons, POAG does not progress or progression is so slow that it never has an important effect on vision. The size of this subgroup is uncertain and may depend on the ethnicity and age of the population and initial findings of ophthalmologic testing. Screening in asymptomatic persons is likely to increase the size of this subgroup. Other patients have more rapid progression, as determined by optic nerve damage, visual field defects, and development of visual impairment.Whether early glaucoma will progress to visual impairment cannot be precisely predicted. Whether the rate of progression of visual field defects remains uniform throughout the course of glaucoma is also not known. Older adults and African Americans seem to be at increased risk and have more rapid progression. Persons with a short life expectancy probably have little to gain from glaucoma screening.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
Harms caused by treatment of glaucoma include formation of cataracts and those resulting from surgery and from topical medications. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment are possible because not all persons who are diagnosed with and treated for glaucoma progress to visual impairment; the magnitude of overdiagnosis and overtreatment is unknown.
<h4>Costs</h4>
The cost of screening varies widely depending on the tests used. Testing with hand-held tonometers and ophthalmoscopes can be done quickly and inexpensively. However, the diagnostic accuracy of these inexpensive tests is not known. According to the National Business Group on Health, the average screening eye examination costs $71. Screening with specialized tests for glaucoma and with newer computerized instruments is more expensive.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
Approximately 62% of Medicare patients enrolled in an HMO were screened for glaucoma in 2009. In 2008, approximately 53% of whites, 47% of African Americans, and 37% of Hispanics reported an annual eye care visit.<a name=""otherconsid""></a>
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
The natural history of glaucoma, particularly the role of IOP and its relationship to optic nerve damage, visual field defects, visual impairment, and blindness, is poorly understood. More evidence is needed on the link between the intermediate glaucoma outcomes of optic nerve damage and visual field loss and the final health outcomes of visual disability and patient-reported outcomes. Evidence for screening would ideally come from a randomized, controlled trial of routine (or targeted) screening versus standard care with long-term follow-up. More studies on treatment that are of adequate duration and size to assess important clinical outcomes (such as visual impairment and vision-related quality of life), or at least greater changes in visual fields, are needed.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/glaucoma/glaucomafinalrs.htm#consider,130,"The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends a comprehensive adult medical eye evaluation, including tests for glaucoma, with frequency depending on the patient's age and other risk factors for glaucoma. The American Optometric Association recommends eye examinations every 1 to 2 years, with frequency depending on age and risk factors for glaucoma.","Burden of Disease

	Glaucoma is characterized as primary (idiopathic) or secondary (resulting from a known cause, such as trauma or inflammation) and as closed- or open-angle. Closed-angle glaucoma may present with acute symptoms, such as eye pain and blurred vision, and is considered an emergency. Primary open-angle glaucoma is the most prevalent type of glaucoma in the United States and the focus of this recommendation. It is defined as optic neuropathy with a visibly open anterior chamber angle (between the iris and the anterior sclera or peripheral cornea) that is associated with progressive death of retinal ganglion cells and axons and visual field loss1, 2, 5. In most cases, damage to the optic nerve is the result of increased pressure in the eye, also known as IOP.

	Approximately 2.5 million persons in the United States have glaucoma, and many are unaware that they have it. Important risk factors include older age, family history of the condition, and African American race8. The overall estimated prevalence of glaucoma in the United States is 1.9%. Age-adjusted estimates are approximately 3 times higher in African Americans than in whites4. A recent study reported a prevalence of 4.7% in Hispanics older than 40 years3.

	Scope of Review

	To update its 2004 recommendation on screening for glaucoma, the USPSTF reviewed evidence on the benefits and harms of screening and of medical and surgical treatment of early glaucoma. Beneficial outcomes of interest for the USPSTF included improved vision-related quality of life and reduced progression of early asymptomatic glaucoma to vision-related impairment. The USPSTF also considered evidence on the accuracy of screening tests for glaucoma.

	Accuracy of Screening Tests

	The USPSTF considered evidence on the accuracy of direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy, photography and computerized imaging of the fundus, measurement of corneal thickness combined with another test for glaucoma, perimetry, and tonometry. The USPSTF did not consider evidence on tests that are experimental or no longer commonly used in the screening for or diagnosis of glaucoma.

	Evaluating the evidence on screening tests is complicated by the lack of an established standard for the diagnosis of glaucoma and a consequent lack of an established gold standard to evaluate accuracy. The USPSTF reviewed more than 100 studies on the accuracy of various tests for glaucoma1. Instead of an established gold standard, many investigators used confirmation of POAG at follow-up examination, diagnosis of POAG requiring treatment, and other individual tests or combinations of tests as the reference against which to evaluate accuracy.

	Tests with the most published studies on accuracy include optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry, confocal scanning laser tomography, frequency-doubling technology, and the Humphrey visual field analyzer. Studies varied appreciably in the devices, variables, thresholds for diagnosis, and measurement of outcomes used. Many studies had several methodological limitations, including enrollment of participants who were not representative of persons who would be tested in practice.

	Most studies did not blind personnel who interpreted test results to the findings of the reference standard and vice versa. Many studies used a reference test that included 1 or more tests comprising the candidate test, resulting in a significant concern about bias. Because of the methodological limitations, variability in study designs, and lack of a diagnostic standard, the USPSTF was not able to make conclusions about the overall accuracy of screening for glaucoma.

	Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment

	No studies directly evaluated whether screening prevents visual field loss, visual impairment, or worsening quality of life. Whereas evidence shows that medical and surgical treatment of early asymptomatic POAG reduce the number of patients whose visual field defects progress, no studies evaluated whether they reduce progression to visual impairment or improve quality of life.

	The USPSTF assessed 1 systematic review (of 10 studies) and 19 additional randomized, controlled trials that evaluated whether medical treatment slows the progression of visual field loss2. A systematic review of 10 studies published in 2007 concluded that medical treatment had a significant protective effect on incident worsening of visual field measurements compared with placebo or no treatment (odds ratio, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.47 to 0.81])2, 9. Nineteen additional primary studies reported mixed results with treatment; a few reported improvements in visual field measurements with medical treatment, 7 reported no change, and 9 reported worsening of visual field measurements.

	Most of these studies were not large or long enough to detect differences in the rates of visual field loss or clinically relevant outcomes related to glaucoma, given the slowly progressive nature of the disease. Three large studies of long duration reported mixed results; 2 studies concluded that medical treatment reduced glaucoma progression, and 1 found no difference between medical treatment and placebo2, 10-12. A 2005 systematic review of 5 randomized, controlled trials that assigned participants to medical and/or surgical treatment or to no treatment reported that those receiving medical and/or surgical treatment were less likely to have progression of visual field loss and optic disc damage (hazard ratio for topical medications vs. no treatment, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.39 to 0.81])13.

	Potential Harms of Screening or Treatment

	No studies addressed the harms of screening. Several assessed the harms of treatment2, 5. Eye redness was the most commonly reported adverse effect of topical medical treatments for glaucoma. In observational studies, the percentage of patients reporting eye redness ranged from 2% to 21%, depending on dose, length of use, and type of medication. Eye pain and burning were also commonly reported with topical medications, occurring in 1% to 3% of participants in observational studies. Other reported adverse effects of topical medications included eye irritation, eye dryness, increased iris pigmentation, and cystoid macular edema.

	Surgical treatments of glaucoma were associated with hypotony, hyphema, shallow anterior chambers, cataract, and choroidal detachment. Penetrating surgical interventions (trabeculectomy) were associated with more frequent adverse effects than nonpenetrating procedures. Studies of surgical procedures more commonly reported cataracts, infection, bleeding, and synechiae than did studies of medications.

	Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit

	Evidence on the accuracy of screening tests and the benefits of screening or treatment in delaying or preventing visual impairment or improving quality of life is inadequate. Therefore, the overall certainty of the evidence is low, and the USPSTF is unable to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening for glaucoma in asymptomatic adults.

	How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?

	The exact cause of POAG is not known. Diagnosis of glaucoma is usually based on several tests that, when combined, evaluate the biological structure and function of the optic nerve and the IOP. Persons with POAG may not have increased IOP, and increased IOP may not result in nerve damage and eventual visual impairment. This finding limits the development of a single gold standard to evaluate the accuracy of screening tests.

	Most persons with glaucoma do not have symptoms. Once vision loss occurs—usually slow loss of side or peripheral vision—the optic nerve is already damaged. When damage is severe enough, loss of vision impairs function and quality of life. Advanced glaucoma can lead to blindness.

	Treatments that reduce IOP prevent the decline in the biological structure and function of the optic nerve caused by glaucoma, thus slowing the worsening of visual field loss. However, the slowly progressive nature of glaucoma makes it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments, especially in preventing or slowing clinically noticeable loss of vision, and screening may lead to detection and treatment of many persons who will remain asymptomatic throughout their life (known as overdiagnosis and overtreatment).

	Response to Public Comments

	A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 19 February to 18 March 2013. A few comments noted that important population subgroups are at increased risk for glaucoma. The USPSTF updated the section on risk with new information on Hispanics. A few comments disagreed that there is no accepted gold standard for screening for glaucoma. None of the comments came to a consensus on an accepted standard for screening, and no change was made to the recommendation statement.

	A few comments cited studies to provide evidence on the link between visual field loss and quality of life. The USPSTF reviewed these studies and determined that they did not provide the necessary evidence to change its conclusions. The USPSTF made several minor revisions to the recommendation statement in response to requests for corrections and clarifications.

"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults aged 18 years or older who are seen by primary care providers. This recommendation focuses on screening (visual inspection and palpation) of the oral cavity performed by primary care providers and not dental providers or otolaryngologists.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
Tobacco and alcohol use are major risk factors for oral cancer. A total of 20% to 30% of cases of oral cancer worldwide are attributable to cigarette smoking. In the United States, up to 75% of cases of oral cancer may be attributable to tobacco and alcohol use. Additional risk factors include male sex, older age, use of betel quid, ultraviolet light exposure, infection with <em>Candida</em>or bacterial flora, and a compromised immune system.<br /><br />Sexually transmitted oral HPV infection (HPV-16) has recently been recognized as an increasingly important risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer. In the United States, the prevalence of oropharyngeal cancer due to oral HPV infection is probably as high as 80% to 95%. The prevalence of oral HPV infection is associated with age, sex, number of sexual partners, and number of cigarettes smoked per day. The effect of multifactorial risk assessment and screening for risk factors on oral cancer morbidity and mortality is unknown.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
The primary screening test for oral cancer is a systematic clinical examination of the oral cavity. According to the World Health Organization and the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, an oral cancer screening examination should include a visual inspection of the face, neck, lips, labial mucosa, buccal mucosa, gingiva, floor of the mouth, tongue, and palate. Mouth mirrors can help visualize all surfaces. The examination also includes palpating the regional lymph nodes, tongue, and floor of the mouth. Any abnormality that lasts for more than 2 weeks should be reevaluated and considered for biopsy. <br /><br />Oropharyngeal cancer is difficult to visualize and is usually located at the base of the tongue (the back third of the tongue), the soft palate (the back part of the roof of the mouth), the tonsils, and the side and back walls of the throat. A comprehensive examination of the oropharynx may require referral to a dental provider or specialist, which is outside the scope of this recommendation.<br /><br />Additional tests proposed as adjuncts to the oral cancer screening examination include toluidine blue dye staining, chemiluminescent and autofluorescent lighting devices, and brush cytopathology. These screening and adjunct tests have not been adequately tested in primary care nondental settings. Although there is interest in screening for oral HPV infection, medical and dental organizations do not recommend it. Currently, no screening test for oral HPV infection has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Evaluating the accuracy of tests that detect oral HPV infection is a potentially promising area of research.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
This recommendation is intended for primary care providers and does not pertain to dental providers or otolaryngologists. Dental care providers and otolaryngologists may conduct a comprehensive examination of the oral cavity and pharynx during the clinical encounter. In deciding whether to screen for oral cancer, primary care providers should consider the following factors. <br /><br /><em>Potential Preventable Burden</em> <br /><br />Up to 75% of cases of oral cancer may be attributed to tobacco and alcohol use. Since 1979, the incidence rate of oral cavity cancer in the United States has been decreasing because of the reduced consumption of alcohol and smoking prevalence. <br /><br />During this period, the incidence of HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinoma has increased. Cancer registry data have shown that from 1988 to 2004, HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancer has decreased from 2.0 cases to 1.0 case per 100,000 persons and HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer has increased more than 3-fold from 0.8 case to 2.6 cases per 100,000 persons. The overall prevalence of oral HPV infection is estimated to be 6.9% in adults aged 14 to 69 years in the United States. However, HPV prevalence can be as high as 20% for persons who have more than 20 lifetime sexual partners or currently use tobacco (more than 1 pack of cigarettes per day). <br /><br />The prevalence of type-specific HPV-16 oral infection is estimated at 1% in adults aged 14 to 69 years (an estimated 2.13 million infected persons). Human papillomavirus-16 is associated with approximately 85% to 95% of cases of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer. Therefore, the increasing role of oral HPV infection as a risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer may warrant future assessment of the independent effect of HPV-16 on incidence and outcomes of oropharyngeal cancer and the health effect of screening persons who are HPV-16&ndash;positive. <br /><br /><em>Potential Harms</em> <br /><br />Suspected oral cancer or its precursors (such as erythroplakia, due to its high risk for transformation to cancer) detected through examination require confirmation by tissue biopsy, which may lead to harms. Harms of treatment of screen-detected oral cancer and its potential precursors (leukoplakia and erythroplakia) may result from complications of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The natural history of screen-detected oral cancer is not well-understood, and as a result, the harms from overdiagnosis and overtreatment are unknown. <br /><br /><em>Current Practice<br /><br /></em>In a 2008 survey of U.S. adults, 29.4% of those aged 18 years or older reported ever having an oral cancer examination in which a physician, dentist, or other health professional pulled on their tongue or palpated their neck. It is unknown what percentage of these examinations were conducted by dentists rather than physicians or other health professionals. Adults aged 40 years or older are more likely to have ever had an examination than those aged 18 to 39 years, despite smoking status. Adults who are most at risk for oral cancer (current smokers aged &ge;40 years) are less likely to have ever had an oral cancer examination than former smokers or adults who have never smoked.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen all adults for tobacco use, recommend against tobacco use, and provide tobacco cessation interventions for those who use tobacco products. The USPSTF also recommends screening and behavioral counseling interventions in primary care settings to reduce alcohol misuse by adults.
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
One of the most important research needs is a randomized, controlled trial assessing the benefits and harms of oral cancer screening in U.S. persons who are at increased risk, such as those with a history of tobacco and heavy alcohol use. Continued research is needed to determine the accuracy of primary care providers, dental hygienists, dentists, or other trained persons screening U.S. patients who are at increased risk. Also needed is longitudinal follow-up of screening studies applicable to the United States that will show the health effect of screening for oral cancer and a clear understanding of who is at high risk in the United States. In addition, given the higher risks for death from oral cancer among African Americans and men, more research is warranted about the risks and benefits of screening in these populations. <br /><br />If HPV continues to become a more clinically significant risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer, the benefits of screening for HPV and selection of populations for oral cancer screening based on HPV status will need to be assessed. As the epidemiology evolves, the most effective screening examination will need to be determined. No screening test for oral HPV infection has been approved by the FDA. More research is needed to determine the benefits and harms of screening for oropharyngeal cancer. Other areas of research include learning about the natural history of oral HPV infection. <br /><br />Vaccines that reduce the risk for HPV infection are available. Whether current vaccines can prevent infection at noncervical sites and help reduce the risk for oropharyngeal cancer is unknown. Research is needed to assess the efficacy of HPV vaccines in preventing infection at noncervical sites and in decreasing the risk for oropharyngeal cancer.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/oralcan/oralcanfinalrec.htm#consider,136,"The American Academy of Family Physicians concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for oral cancer in asymptomatic adults. The American Cancer Society recommends that adults aged 20 years or older who have periodic health examinations should have the oral cavity examined as part of a cancer-related checkup. The American Dental Association recommends that providers remain alert for signs of potentially malignant lesions or early-stage cancer in patients during routine oral examinations, particularly for patients who use tobacco or have heavy alcohol consumption.","Burden of Disease
According to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Cancer Institute, there were 35,807 cases of oral and pharyngeal cancer in the United States in 2009, the most recent year of data available 2. Nearly three fourths of all cases occur in men, making it the eighth most common cancer in men (it is the 14th most common cancer in women) in the United States.
More than one half of all persons with oral and pharyngeal cancer have regional or distant metastases at diagnosis. Relative 5-year survival is 82.4% for localized disease, 55.5% for regional lymph node spread, and 33.2% for distant metastases 1, 3. Patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer are diagnosed an average 5 years younger and have better survival than patients with HPV-negative oral cancer 4.
African Americans previously had higher incidence rates of oral and pharyngeal cancer than white persons. However, current data indicate a change in racial or ethnic incidence rates, such that white men and women now have higher incidence rates 3. This change in incidence is ascribed to increases in HPV-related oral and pharyngeal (including oropharyngeal) cancer in white persons, along with a reduction in HPV-related and non–HPV-related oral and pharyngeal cancer in African Americans 11. American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian and Pacific Islander, and Latino men and women have lower incidence rates than white and African American men and women. Mortality rates are substantially higher in African Americans and in men; mortality rates in American Indian and Alaska Native men are about the same as in white men, but Asian, Pacific Islander, and Latino men have lower mortality rates than white men 3.
Scope of Review
The previous USPSTF recommendation found no evidence that screening for oral cancer led to improved health outcomes and no evidence on the harms of screening or the benefits of early treatment 12. To update its previous recommendation, the USPSTF reviewed evidence to answer the following questions: 1) Does screening for oral cancer reduce morbidity or mortality? and 2) How accurate is the screening oral examination for identifying oral cancer or potentially malignant disorders that have a high likelihood of progression to oral cancer? The focus of this recommendation is screening (visual inspection and palpation) of the oral cavity performed by primary care providers and not dental providers or otolaryngologists.
Accuracy of Screening Tests
No evidence was found on screening for oral cancer in the general or high-risk U.S. population. Seven studies (n = 49,120) examined the performance characteristics of the oral screening examination. These studies were generally conducted in settings with an increased incidence of and mortality rate from oral cancer (India and Taiwan) compared with U.S. rates. The studies also had considerable heterogeneity in who performed the screening and greatly varied in test performance characteristics 1.
 Across the 7 studies, sensitivity for oral cancer or potentially malignant disorders ranged from 18.0% to 94.3% and specificity ranged from 54.0% to 99.9%. The positive predictive value ranged from 17.0% to 86.6%, and the negative predictive value ranged from 73.0% to 99.3% 1.
 Two studies in the United Kingdom assessed oral examinations performed by general dentists in older adults (aged ≥40 years) who were at increased risk because of alcohol and tobacco use and in a mixed sample with unknown risk factors. The dental examination in the high-risk sample (n = 2027) showed a sensitivity of 74%, specificity of 99%, and positive predictive value of 67%, whereas the study of patients with unknown risk factors found a sensitivity of 71%, specificity of 99%, and positive predictive value of 86%. Although the patients in the U.K. study may be similar to those in the U.S. population, the results of these studies are limited by an imperfect reference standard (comparison with a “more expert” examiner), by combining the detection of potentially malignant disorders with that of oral cancer, and by an unclear delineation of high-risk status. These results would need to be confirmed by studies with longitudinal follow-up 1.
 When compared with expert or trained screening examinations, self-examinations in 2 studies performed in India and the United Kingdom were insensitive (18% and 33%, respectively) 1. Toluidine blue was not found to significantly improve screening for premalignant or malignant lesions, did not affect the incidence of oral cancer, and did not improve outcomes (1 study). No acceptable evidence for other adjunctive devices was found in the literature 1.
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment
No direct evidence was available on whether screening reduces morbidity or mortality in general or high-risk U.S. populations. One fair-quality, randomized, controlled trial of home-based screening for oral cancer by advanced health workers (n = 191,873) conducted in Kerala, India, found no statistical difference in oral cancer mortality rates between screening and control groups after 9 years of follow-up (rate ratio, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.51 to 1.22]) 1, 10. After an additional screening round and 15 years of follow-up, oral cancer mortality ratios were of similar magnitude and not statistically significant 13. Screened participants were diagnosed with oral cancer at earlier stages with a greater 5-year survival than control participants, possibly as a result of lead-time bias 1, 14.
A post hoc subgroup analysis of participants in the Kerala study who reported tobacco and alcohol use (n = 84,600) found a significant reduction in oral cancer mortality rates in those assigned to the screening group (rate ratio, 0.66 [CI, 0.45 to 0.95]). A similar post hoc analysis at 15 years suggested a diminished but still significant oral cancer mortality reduction in the screening group (rate ratio, 0.76 [CI, 0.60 to 0.97]) 13. However, the subgroup analyses do not meet high-quality criteria. The results of the overall study and the post hoc subgroup analysis do not provide sufficient evidence on screening because of limited applicability to the U.S. population and methodological limitations, such as inadequate accounting for clustering in the results, low adherence to follow-up, imbalance in baseline risk factors, possible lead- and length-time bias, and not reporting harms of screening or how lesions were treated. In addition, these participants commonly chewed paan (a carcinogenic compound containing areca nut and betel leaf), which is not used in the United States and affects the generalizability of this study. India also has higher oral cancer incidence, prevalence, and mortality, as well as a different health care system, than the United States, which also affects the applicability of the study results in the U.S. population 1, 14.
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
A potentially important harm of screening for oral cancer is adverse effects from biopsy or surgery performed on oral lesions that would have regressed spontaneously or not have progressed to cancer during a patient's lifetime (overdiagnosis and overtreatment). There was insufficient evidence on harms from the screening test or from false-positive or false-negative results.
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the diagnostic accuracy, benefits, and harms of screening for oral cancer. Therefore, the USPSTF was unable to determine the balance of benefits and harms.
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
The oral cancer examination is designed to detect oral cancer or potentially malignant disorders at earlier stages. However, visual examination or biopsy cannot reliably distinguish potentially malignant disorders from lesions that may spontaneously regress or not progress (overdiagnosis), and evidence that earlier treatment improves health outcomes is lacking. Test performance characteristics for the oral screening examinations also varied widely.
The natural history of oropharyngeal cancer is not well-understood. Knowledge of this particular cancer is evolving as more is learned about the association between oropharyngeal cancer and HPV. More evidence is needed to address effective screening strategies, treatment, and primary prevention. Clinical outcomes may differ among countries based on predominant etiology because patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer are generally diagnosed younger and survive longer than patients with HPV-negative oral cancer.

"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to children and adolescents who do not have symptoms of hypertension.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
The strongest risk factor for primary hypertension in children and adolescents is elevated body mass index. Other risk factors include low birhweight, male sex, ethnicity, and family history of hypertension.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
In deciding whether to screen children and adolescents for hypertension, clinicians should consider the following. <br /><br /><em>Potential Preventable Burden</em> <br /><br />The increasing prevalence of hypertension in children and adolescents, possibly driven by childhood obesity, suggests that identification and treatment of hypertension is likely to become a significant health care issue. The goal of identifying and treating children and adolescents with primary hypertension can be viewed within a larger framework of adult cardiovascular risk reduction, which includes addressing other biometric risk factors, such as elevated body mass index and lipid profiles and hyperglycemia. The variables for cardiovascular risk reduction in adults are better understood because hypertension in adults is defined by relatively consistent quantitative thresholds, the epidemiologic evidence demonstrates the association between hypertension and subsequent cardiovascular risk, and treatment trials have shown that reduction in blood pressure reduces the risk for cardiovascular events in older adults. <br /><br />Extending the adult framework for cardiovascular risk reduction to children and adolescents is limited by several methodological challenges that complicate determining the potential preventable burden. Blood pressure percentiles are used to define normative values for children and adolescents, and less is known about the clinical and epidemiologic significance of these thresholds in terms of their association with adult cardiovascular disease. In addition, the performance characteristics of current methods for diagnosing hypertension during childhood are limited and of concern because of false-positive rates (blood pressure measurements that later normalize). Evidence on the association between childhood blood pressure and adult hypertension is limited, as is evidence on the longitudinal association between childhood blood pressure and other markers of adult cardiovascular disease. <br /><br />Most important, the limited data on treatment of hypertension in children and adolescents do not include longer-term follow-up to show reductions in surrogate, subclinical, or clinical measures of cardiovascular disease in either later adolescence or young adulthood. This limited evidence base makes it difficult to quantify the true significance and consequences of a hypertension diagnosis in children and adolescents and the potential benefit of early intervention. <br /><br />One rationale that has been suggested for screening is to identify secondary hypertension&mdash;a relatively rare condition resulting from another underlying cause, such as renal parenchymal disease or renovascular disease. Younger children are more likely than older children and adolescents to have a secondary cause of hypertension; a recent study suggests that secondary causes of hypertension are significantly more common in children younger than 6 years than in older children. Secondary hypertension is unlikely to be the only clinical manifestation of the underlying disorder in these cases, and management is primarily targeted at treating the underlying condition, as well as controlling hypertension. As children age into adolescence, 85% to 95% of all hypertension diagnoses are considered primary. <br /><br /><em>Potential Harms</em> <br /><br />Although 1 good-quality study suggests that no adverse effects are associated with hypertension detection in childhood, the evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of clinic-based screening for hypertension suggests that false-positive results may occur. Thus, unnecessary secondary evaluations or treatments may be common, particularly with frequent blood pressure screening. Pharmacologic interventions have been shown to be well-tolerated over relatively short periods. Treatment of hypertension in childhood and adolescence with pharmacologic agents is done for a much longer period, and adverse effects of such pharmacotherapy can occur. <br /><br /><em>Current Practice<br /><br /></em>Current screening practice for elevated blood pressure typically involves measurement of blood pressure in office-based health care settings as part of well-child or sports preparticipation examinations, often in conjunction with other vital signs and growth parameters. The National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP) percentile charts are used to interpret systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) measurements and categorize them as normal, prehypertension, or hypertension on the basis of the child's age, height, and sex for each year of the child's life from age 3 to 18 years.<br /><br />A 2012 study analyzing data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey assessed blood pressure screening during pediatric ambulatory office visits. It found that screening was done during 67% of preventive care visits and 35% of ambulatory visits. Screening was more common in children who were overweight or obese; 84% of these preventive care visits included screening for hypertension. It was also more likely to be done in older children.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
The consensus-based guidelines of the NHBPEP and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute define hypertension in children on the basis of percentiles according to age, height, and sex. Hypertension is defined as SBP or DBP at or above the 95th percentile. Hypertension is classified as stage 1 (SBP or DBP from 95th to 99th percentile, plus 5 mm Hg) or stage 2 (SBP or DBP &gt;99th percentile, plus 5 mm Hg). The NHBPEP provides guidance on optimal blood pressure measurement techniques, such as appropriate cuff size and type of sphygmomanometer. Blood pressure should be measured in a controlled environment after 5 minutes of rest, with the patient seated and the right arm supported at heart level.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
Stage 1 hypertension in children is treated with lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions. Medications are not recommended as first-line therapy. Lifestyle interventions for hypertension include weight reduction in children who are overweight or obese, increased physical activity, and restricted sodium intake, as well as education and counseling. The NHBPEP recommends medication for children with stage 2 hypertension or for hypertension that is unresponsive to lifestyle modification.<br /><br />Many medications have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hypertension in children, including diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, &beta;-blockers, and vasodilators.
<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>
Several organizations recommend routine screening of blood pressure at well-child visits starting at age 3 years, based on consensus.&nbsp;
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
There are several critical evidence gaps in better understanding the potential net benefit of screening for hypertension in childhood and adolescence. Evidence about the accuracy and reliability of blood pressure screening tools and protocols in primary care among children and adolescents of varying ages and characteristics, such as those who are obese, is needed. Comparative accuracy studies that examine the different types of devices to measure blood pressure, such as newer devices that obtain several readings in 1 visit, home-based devices, and ambulatory blood pressure measurement, are needed. In addition, screening strategies that reduce the rate of false-positive diagnoses of hypertension need to be identified. Studies on the adverse effects of screening are also needed. <br /><br />Prospective and retrospective cohort studies that include blood pressure measures and other cardiovascular risk factors in children and adolescents with long-term follow-up are needed to examine the adolescent and adult health outcomes of hypertension in childhood. Studies that elucidate the association among childhood hypertension, adult hypertension, and surrogate measures of cardiovascular disease in childhood and adulthood, as well as adult clinical cardiovascular disease, are also needed. <br /><br />Most important, evidence to ascertain the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of pharmacologic and lifestyle interventions to achieve sustained reductions in blood pressure and longer-term modification of adult hypertension and cardiovascular risk in children with primary hypertension is needed. Such studies should include longer follow-up intervals to determine the long-term effectiveness of these interventions in achieving sustained reductions in blood pressure during childhood and adolescence or reductions in future adult hypertension. Although trials with clinical cardiovascular end points are more challenging in children, treatment trials demonstrating changes in surrogate or subclinical cardiovascular outcomes during adolescence or young adulthood are feasible and warranted. Trials focusing on high-risk adolescent populations (such as those with obesity) that include longer-term follow-up with future hypertension and subclinical cardiovascular outcomes should be possible. Studies of treatment during childhood should include an assessment of medication harms, measures of long-term compliance, and study designs that examine individual components of multifactorial interventions.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/hypechild/hypechldfinalrec.htm#consider,135,"The American Academy of Pediatrics officially endorsed the NHBPEP 2004 recommendation that children aged 3 years and older have blood pressure measurement at least once at every &ldquo;health care episode&rdquo;. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Expert Panel on Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents recommends annual blood pressure screening in children from ages 3 to 17 years. Bright Futures&nbsp;and other organizations, such as the American Heart Association, recommend routine screening for increased blood pressure in children during annual well-child visits beginning at age 3 years. The American Academy of Family Physicians states that there is insufficient evidence for or against routine screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents.","Burden of Disease

	The prevalence of hypertension in children and adolescents is 1% to 5%. Obese children have a higher prevalence of approximately 11%. Younger children are more likely to have secondary hypertension, whereas older children and adolescents are more likely to have primary hypertension. In school-aged children, secondary hypertension accounts for 70% to 85% of cases. As children age into adolescence, 85% to 95% of cases are primary hypertension. This recommendation focuses on primary hypertension and screening in asymptomatic children and adolescents. Secondary hypertension may not be the initial or only clinical manifestation of the underlying disorder and is therefore beyond the scope of this recommendation 1, 4, 7

	Adult hypertension is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events. One rationale for blood pressure screening in children and adolescents is that finding and treating hypertension early in childhood may improve cardiovascular outcomes in adulthood.

	Scope of Review

	To update its 2003 recommendation on screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents 8, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening and diagnostic accuracy of tests for blood pressure in children and adolescents, effectiveness and harms of treatment of screen-detected primary childhood hypertension, and association between hypertension and markers of cardiovascular disease in childhood and adulthood. Screening for and treatment of secondary hypertension were not part of the review.

	Accuracy of Screening Tests

	Two studies provided evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of blood pressure measurement tools and protocols. Although different reference standards were used (ambulatory blood pressure measurement and repeated measurements using a sphygmomanometer), the studies reported similar sensitivities (0.65 and 0.72) and specificities (0.75 and 0.92). Positive predictive values in both studies were low (0.37 and 0.17). These studies suggest that there is moderate sensitivity in detecting elevated blood pressure; however, many children identified as having elevated blood pressure will not have hypertension. One study was done in a hypertension clinic in Greece, possibly limiting generalizability to a primary care population in the United States. The other study took place in a high school clinic 1.

	Association With Adult Hypertension and Cardiovascular Disease

	Ten longitudinal studies provided evidence on the association between elevated blood pressure in childhood and adulthood (7 studies), carotid intima–media thickness (2 studies), and microalbuminuria (1 study). Eight of the studies were based on U.S. longitudinal data. These studies used different thresholds for defining elevated blood pressure and hypertension in children and different definitions of hypertension in adults 1.

	Four studies reported that elevated blood pressure in childhood and adolescence was significantly associated with hypertension in adulthood, with odds ratios ranging from 1.1 to 4.5 and relative risks ranging from 1.5 to 9; however, the 2 studies that reported the sensitivity and specificity of detecting hypertension in childhood and adolescence for adult hypertension gave widely differing estimates (sensitivity, 0.0 to 0.66; specificity, 0.77 to 1.0). Positive predictive values ranged from 0.19 to 0.65 1.

	Three studies examined the association between childhood and adolescent hypertension and other intermediate outcomes related to hypertension in adulthood. The association between childhood hypertension and carotid intima–media thickness is inconclusive because of conflicting results from 2 studies 1.

	One study found that childhood hypertension was significantly associated with microalbuminuria in black adults but not white adults. No evidence showed an association between hypertension in childhood and other intermediate or final hypertension-related outcomes in adulthood 1.

	Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment

	No direct evidence demonstrated that screening children and adolescents for hypertension is effective in delaying the onset of or reducing the risk for adverse cardiovascular health outcomes related to hypertension, either in childhood or adulthood.

	No studies reported on the effectiveness of treatments for primary childhood hypertension and subsequent reduction of blood pressure or other intermediate cardiovascular outcomes in adults.

Pharmacologic Interventions

	Fourteen studies examined the effectiveness of interventions to reduce blood pressure in children and adolescents. Seven randomized, controlled trials of monotherapy with pharmacologic interventions were small, of fair quality, and mostly limited to children or adolescents with primary hypertension. All 7 trials reported either reductions in the absolute level of blood pressure or increased proportions of children achieving normotensive blood pressure. However, the antihypertension effects were of variable magnitude, not consistently present for any given agent across both SBP and DBP measurements, and not always significantly different from placebo or baseline (or this difference was not reported). In addition, none of the medications were evaluated in more than 1 study. The studies were also of short duration, with the longest trials lasting 4 weeks, and most were done in older children (mean age, 12 years) 1.

Lifestyle Modification

	The only trial of medication combined with various lifestyle components showed evidence of sustained reduction of blood pressure after 6 months; this trial was an intensive, school-based intervention. Of 6 trials that assessed lifestyle interventions, only 1 (a small, Danish, school-based trial of increased number of exercise classes) reported a significant decrease in blood pressure after 8 months 1.

	Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment

	One small (85 patients), good-quality, prospective study examined children labeled with hypertension compared with a control group matched by age and sex. School absenteeism rates did not differ significantly in the year after identification of elevated blood pressure. Data on other potential harms of screening were not reported 2.

	Commonly reported adverse events associated with hypertension medications included headache, cardiac events, gastrointestinal events, and cough. Medications for treating primary hypertension in children seemed to be well-tolerated, with 1 of 13 studies showing significant differences in rates of adverse events and serious adverse events between active intervention and placebo groups. However, studies of harms associated with pharmacologic interventions were limited by quality and generalizability and provided no information about the long-term risk for adverse effects. For example, most studies enrolled mixed populations of children with primary and secondary hypertension, used open-label periods to examine adverse effects, and had limited power to identify rare adverse events 1.

	No studies reported on harms associated with lifestyle interventions. Evidence on adverse events associated with interventions that combine medication and lifestyle modifications is lacking.

	Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit

	The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of screening for primary hypertension. The USPSTF also found inadequate evidence on the effectiveness of treatment and harms of screening or treatment. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for hypertension in children and adolescents is lacking and that the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.

	How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?

	The proportion of children with primary hypertension who revert to normal blood pressure over time, without any intervention, and those who will continue to have hypertension in adulthood is unknown.

	Persistent elevation of blood pressure in adults is an established risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders and renal impairment. However, these conditions are often distant future events for children and adolescents. As a result, intermediate measures of target end-organ injury, including physical alterations to the structure of vascular walls (early atherosclerosis, thickening of arteries) and the heart (increased left ventricle mass) and altered renal function (microalbuminuria), are examined. At present, the evidence about the relationship between elevated blood pressure or intermediate outcomes in children and the presence of hypertension and intermediate outcomes in adults is inconsistent.

	Response to Public Comments

	A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 26 February to 25 March 2013. Several comments noted the importance of detecting secondary hypertension through screening. In response to these comments, the USPSTF added additional information about secondary hypertension to the Clinical Considerations. Additional text was also added to clarify the scope of the review and to address evidence gaps in the “Benefits of Detection and Early Intervention,” “Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement,” and “Research Gaps” sections.

"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women who have not been diagnosed with BRCA-related cancer. <br /><br />Women who have 1 or more family members with a known potentially harmful mutation in the <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em>genes should be offered genetic counseling and testing.<br /><br />The USPSTF recognizes the potential importance of further evaluating women who have a diagnosis of breast or ovarian cancer. Some women receive genetic testing as part of a cancer evaluation at the time of diagnosis of breast cancer. The USPSTF did not review the appropriate use of BRCA testing in the evaluation of women who are newly diagnosed with breast cancer. That assessment is part of disease management and is beyond the scope of this recommendation. Women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer in the past and who did not receive BRCA testing as part of their cancer care but have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer should be encouraged to discuss further evaluation with their clinician.<br /><br />These recommendations do not apply to men, although male family members may be identified for testing during evaluation.
<h3>Family History Screening and Risk Assessment</h3>
Mutations in the BRCA genes cluster in families, exhibiting an autosomal dominant pattern of transmission in maternal or paternal lineage. During standard elicitation of family history information from patients, primary care providers should ask about specific types of cancer, primary cancer sites, which family members were affected, relatives with multiple types of primary cancer, and the age at diagnosis and sex of affected family members. <br /><br />For women who have at least 1 family member with breast, ovarian, or other types of BRCA-related cancer, primary care providers may use 1 of several brief familial risk stratification tools to determine the need for in-depth genetic counseling. <br /><br />Although several risk tools are available, the tools evaluated by the USPSTF include the Ontario Family History Assessment Tool (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/brcatest/brcatestfinalrstab.htm#tab1"">Table 1</a>), Manchester Scoring System (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/brcatest/brcatestfinalrstab.htm#tab2"">Table 2</a>), Referral Screening Tool (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/brcatest/brcatestfinalrstab.htm#tab3"">Table 3</a>), Pedigree Assessment Tool (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/brcatest/brcatestfinalrstab.htm#tab4"">Table 4</a>), and FHS-7 (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/brcatest/brcatestfinalrstab.htm#tab5"">Table 5</a>). The Referral Screening Tool (available at <a href=""http://www.breastcancergenescreen.org/"">www.breastcancergenescreen.org</a>) and FHS-7 are the simplest and quickest to administer. All of these tools seem to be clinically useful predictors of which women should be referred for genetic counseling due to increased risk for potentially harmful BRCA mutations (most sensitivity estimates were &gt;85%), although some models have been evaluated in only 1 study. To determine which patients would benefit from BRCA risk assessment, primary care providers should not use general breast cancer risk assessment models (for example, the National Cancer Institute Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool, which is based on the Gail model) because they are not designed to determine which women should receive genetic counseling or BRCA testing.<br /><br />In general, these tools elicit information about factors that are associated with increased likelihood of BRCA mutations. Family history factors associated with increased likelihood of potentially harmful BRCA mutations include breast cancer diagnosis before age 50 years, bilateral breast cancer, presence of breast and ovarian cancer, presence of breast cancer in 1 or more male family members, multiple cases of breast cancer in the family, 1 or more family members with 2 primary types of BRCA-related cancer, and Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity. The USPSTF recognizes that each risk assessment tool has limitations and found insufficient comparative evidence to recommend one tool over another. The USPSTF also found insufficient evidence to support a specific risk threshold for referral for testing.
<h3>Genetic Counseling</h3>
Genetic counseling about BRCA mutation testing may be done by trained health professionals, including trained primary care providers. Several professional organizations describe the skills and training necessary to provide comprehensive genetic counseling. The process of genetic counseling includes detailed kindred analysis and risk assessment for potentially harmful BRCA mutations; education about the possible results of testing and their implications; identification of affected family members who may be preferred candidates for testing; outlining options for screening, risk-reducing medications, or surgery for eligible patients; and follow-up counseling for interpretation of test results.
<h3>BRCA Mutation Testing</h3>
Adequate evidence suggests that current genetic sequencing tests can accurately detect BRCA mutations. Testing for BRCA mutations should be done only when an individual has personal or family history that suggests an inherited cancer susceptibility, when an individual has access to a health professional who is trained to provide genetic counseling and interpret test results, and when test results will aid in decision making. Initial testing of a family member who has breast or ovarian cancer is the preferred strategy in most cases, but it is reasonable to test if no affected relative is available. It is essential that before testing, the individual is fully informed about the implications of testing and has expressed a desire for it.<br /><br />The type of mutation analysis required depends on family history. Individuals from families with known mutations or from ethnic groups in which certain mutations are more common (for example, Ashkenazi Jewish women) can be tested for these specific mutations.<br /><br />Individuals without linkages to families or groups with known mutations receive more comprehensive testing. In these cases, when possible, testing should begin with a relative who has breast or ovarian cancer to determine whether affected family members have a clinically significant mutation.<br /><br />Tests for BRCA mutations are highly sensitive and specific for known mutations, but interpretation of results is complex and generally requires posttest counseling. Test results for genetic mutations are reported as positive (that is, potentially harmful mutation detected), variants of uncertain clinical significance, uninformative-negative, or true-negative. Women who have relatives with known BRCA mutations can be reassured about their inherited risk for a potentially harmful mutation if the results are negative (that is, a true negative). Some studies suggest increased breast cancer risk in some women with true-negative results. However, a comprehensive meta-analysis conducted for the USPSTF that included these studies found that breast cancer risk is generally not increased in women with true-negative results. An uninformative-negative result occurs when a woman's test does not detect a potentially harmful mutation but no relatives have been tested or no mutations have been detected in tested relatives. Available tests may not be able to identify mutations in these families. Risk for breast cancer is increased in women with uninformative-negative results.
<h3>Timing of Screening</h3>
Consideration of screening for potentially harmful BRCA mutations should begin once women have reached the age of consent (18 years). Primary care providers should periodically assess all patients for changes in family history (for example, comprehensive review at least every 5 to 10 years.
<h3>Interventions for Women Who Are BRCA Mutation Carriers</h3>
Interventions that may reduce risk for cancer or cancer-related death in women who are BRCA mutation carriers include earlier, more frequent, or intensive cancer screening; risk-reducing medications (for example, tamoxifen or raloxifene); and risk-reducing surgery (for example, mastectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy). However, the strength of evidence varies across the types of interventions. <br /><br />Evidence is lacking on the effect of intensive screening for BRCA-related cancer on clinical outcomes in women who are BRCA mutation carriers. Medications, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene, have been shown to reduce the incidence of invasive breast cancer in high-risk women in the general population, but they have not been studied specifically in women who are BRCA mutation carriers. <br /><br />In high-risk women and those who are BRCA mutation carriers, cohort studies of risk-reducing surgery (mastectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy) showed substantially reduced risk for breast or ovarian cancer. Breast cancer risk was reduced by 85% to 100% with mastectomy and by 37% to 100% with oophorectomy, and ovarian cancer risk was reduced by 69% to 100% with oophorectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy. Salpingo-oophorectomy was also associated with a 55% relative reduction in all-cause mortality (as measured during the course of the study) in women with <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em>mutations and without a history of breast cancer.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
The USPSTF recommendations on medications for breast cancer risk reduction are available on the USPSTF Web site (www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org).<br /><br />The USPSTF recommends against screening for ovarian cancer in women. This recommendation does not apply to women with known genetic mutations that increase their risk for ovarian cancer (for example, BRCA mutations).
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The National Cancer Institute Cancer Genetics Services Directory provides a list of professionals who offer services related to cancer genetics, including cancer risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic susceptibility testing (available at <a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/genetics/directory"">http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/genetics/directory</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
Although some studies have reported that women prefer in-person genetic counseling, telephone- or computer-based counseling may be considered for women who would not otherwise have access to these services.
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Research on risk assessment and testing for BRCA mutations has focused on short-term outcomes for highly selected women in referral centers. Additional studies are needed, including comparative effectiveness trials of approaches to risk screening and strategies to improve access to genetic counseling and BRCA testing for high-risk individuals. <br /><br />Another unresolved question is what specific training is needed (for persons other than trained genetic counselors) to provide genetic counseling. It would be helpful to understand which methods of delivery of genetic counseling are most effective, including those that can increase access to genetic counseling in rural or other settings. Trials comparing types of providers and protocols could address these questions. <br /><br />What happens after patients are identified as high-risk in clinical settings is unknown. The consequences of genetic testing for individuals and their relatives require more study. Well-designed investigations using standardized measures and diverse study populations are needed. <br /><br />An expanded database or registry of patients receiving genetic counseling for inherited breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility or who are tested for BRCA mutations would provide useful information about predictors of cancer and response to interventions. Additional data are needed from women of varying socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic groups. <br /><br />For women who are mutation carriers, studies about the effectiveness of intensive cancer screening and risk-reducing medications and the effects of age at intervention on improving long-term outcomes are needed. This research would increase knowledge of the relative benefits and harms of interventions that are provided on the basis of genetic risk information.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/brcatest/brcatestfinalrs.htm#consider,134,"The National Comprehensive Cancer Network provides specific criteria for genetic counseling and testing. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends genetic risk assessment for women who have more than a 20% to 25% risk for an inherited predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer and states that it may be helpful for patients with more than a 5% to 10% risk. The American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends genetic testing when there is personal or family history suggestive of genetic cancer susceptibility, the test can be adequately interpreted, and the results will aid in diagnosis or medical management of the patient or family member who has hereditary risk for cancer. It also recommends genetic testing only when pretest and posttest counseling are included. The National Society of Genetic Counselors has issued practice guidelines for risk assessment and genetic counseling for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. It recommends that genetic testing should be offered to individuals with a personal or family history suggestive of an inherited cancer syndrome, when the test can be adequately interpreted, if testing will influence medical management of the patient or relative, when potential benefits outweigh potential risks, if testing is voluntary, and when the individual seeking testing or a legal proxy can provide informed consent. The European Society for Medical Oncology recommends that all patients who may be referred for BRCA testing should first complete informed consent and genetic counseling and patients who are mutation carriers should be encouraged to advise close family members to obtain genetic counseling. The Society of Gynecologic Oncologists recommends genetic risk assessment for individuals with a personal risk of more than approximately 20% to 25% for an inherited predisposition to cancer and states that it may be helpful for patients with more than approximately 5% to 10% risk. Genetic testing for cancer predisposition requires informed consent that should encompass pretest education and counseling about the risks, benefits, and limitations of testing, including the implications of both positive and negative genetic test results.","Burden of Disease
Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women in the United States and is the second leading cause of cancer death30, 31. In 2013, an estimated 232,340 women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 39,620 women will die of the disease32. According to lifetime risk estimates for the general population, 12.3% of women will develop breast cancer during their lives and 2.74% will die of it2.
Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States31, accounting for an estimated 22,240 new cases and 14,030 deaths in 201333. According to lifetime risk estimates for the general population, 1.4% of women will develop ovarian cancer during their lives and 1.0% will die of it2.
Estimates of the prevalence of potentially harmful BRCA mutations vary by population. The estimated prevalence is 0.2% to 0.3% in the general population of women5-8, 6.0% in women with cancer onset before age 40 years8, 34, 35, and 2.1% in the general population of Ashkenazi Jewish women36-39. In a meta-analysis of studies in which recruitment was based on family history of breast or ovarian cancer, BRCA1 mutation prevalence was 13.6%, BRCA2 mutation prevalence was 7.9%, and prevalence of either mutation was 19.8%9.
Scope of Review
This recommendation applies to women who have no signs or symptoms of BRCA-related cancer. For its updated evidence review, the USPSTF considered risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for potentially harmful BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations in asymptomatic women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer but no personal history of cancer or known potentially harmful BRCA mutations in their family. The USPSTF also reviewed interventions aimed at reducing the risk for BRCA-related cancer in women with potentially harmful BRCA mutations, including intensive cancer screening (for example, earlier and more frequent mammography or magnetic resonance imaging of the breast), medications (for example, tamoxifen or raloxifene), and risk-reducing surgery (for example, mastectomy or oophorectomy). Studies about patients with current or past breast or ovarian cancer were excluded unless they were designed to address screening issues in women without cancer (for example, retrospective or case–control studies).
Accuracy of Familial Risk Assessment
The USPSTF reviewed several tools that could be used in primary care settings to predict individual risk for breast cancer and potentially harmful BRCA mutations.
Tools specifically designed to determine risk for BRCA-related cancer are primarily intended for use by nongeneticist health care providers to guide referral to genetic counselors for more definitive evaluation. Models that have been validated in studies include the Ontario Family History Assessment Tool (Table 1), Manchester Scoring System (Table 2), Referral Screening Tool (Table 3), Pedigree Assessment Tool (Table 4), and FHS-7 (Table 5)10-19. In general, these tools elicit information about factors associated with increased likelihood of BRCA mutations. They are clinically useful predictors of which women should be referred for genetic counseling because of increased risk for potentially harmful BRCA mutations (most sensitivity estimates were >85%), although some models have been evaluated in only 1 study9, 20. The USPSTF recognizes that each risk assessment tool has limitations and found insufficient evidence to recommend one tool over another.
Accuracy of BRCA Mutation Testing
The type of mutation analysis done depends on family history. Individuals from families with known mutations or from ethnic groups with common mutations (for example, Ashkenazi Jewish women) can be tested specifically for these mutations. The sensitivity and specificity of analysis techniques are measured by individual clinical laboratories and are not publicly available. Individuals without linkages to families or groups with known mutations receive more comprehensive testing. In these cases, guidelines recommend initial testing of a relative with known breast or ovarian cancer, when possible, to check for the presence of clinically significant mutations.
Effectiveness of BRCA Mutation Testing and Early Detection and Treatment
To understand the potential benefits and harms of genetic counseling, the USPSTF reviewed 18 studies40-57 published since its previous review. Studies generally reported positive (or no negative) psychological effects, increased accuracy of risk perception, or decreased intention to have genetic testing.
Genetic counseling significantly decreased breast cancer worry in 8 studies44–46, 48, 50, 53–55. Three studies41, 44, 49 reported decreased or no changes in general anxiety and depression after genetic counseling, whereas other studies found no significant differences in anxiety scores48, 50. However, 1 of these studies noted an increase in state anxiety scores after genetic counseling44. Eight studies published since 2004 reported improved accuracy of risk perception after genetic counseling41, 42, 44-47, 49, 50, 52. Two studies reported decreased intention to have genetic testing after genetic counseling45, 46.
Interventions that may reduce risk for cancer in women who are BRCA mutation carriers include: earlier, more frequent, or intensive cancer screening; use of selective estrogen receptor modulators as risk-reducing medications (for example, tamoxifen or raloxifene); and risk-reducing surgery (for example, mastectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy).
Evidence is lacking on the effect of intensive screening for BRCA-related cancer on clinical outcomes in women who are BRCA mutation carriers.
Selective estrogen receptor modulators reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer in several randomized, controlled trials58-64, although clinical trials of tamoxifen and raloxifene have not been conducted specifically in women who are BRCA mutation carriers. In a meta-analysis of trials published to date26, 65, tamoxifen and raloxifene reduced the incidence of estrogen receptor–positive invasive breast cancer, with 7 fewer events per 1000 women for tamoxifen (4 trials) and 9 fewer events per 1000 women for raloxifene (2 trials), assuming 5 years of treatment. Selective estrogen receptor modulators do not reduce risk for estrogen receptor–negative breast cancer, which includes 69% of breast cancer cases associated with BRCA1 mutations and 16% associated with BRCA2 mutations66.
In cohort studies of high-risk women and those who are BRCA mutation carriers, risk-reducing surgery (for example, mastectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy) substantially reduced risk for breast or ovarian cancer. Mastectomy reduced breast cancer risk by 85% to 100%, and oophorectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy reduced ovarian cancer risk by 69% to 100% and breast cancer risk by 37% to 100%9. In 1 fair-quality prospective cohort study27, salpingo-oophorectomy was also associated with a 55% relative reduction in all-cause mortality (as measured during the course of the study) in women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations without a history of breast cancer. Breast cancer risk reduction associated with oophorectomy was more pronounced in women who were premenopausal at the time of surgery27, 67.
Potential Harms of Cancer Screening and Treatment
Intensive screening for breast and ovarian cancer is associated with false-positive results, unnecessary imaging, and unneeded surgery. In 2 studies comparing mammography with magnetic resonance imaging for breast cancer screening in which 18% to 100% of study participants were BRCA mutation carriers, mammography was associated with higher false-positive rates (14% vs. 5.5% in the first round of screening; P < 0.00168; 15% vs. 11% in another study69) and more false-negative results (12 vs. 1 case in the first round of screening; 12 vs. 4 cases in subsequent rounds68. In a retrospective analysis of a cohort of women with potentially harmful BRCA mutations or first-degree relatives with BRCA mutations, those who were screened with mammography were more likely to have unneeded imaging than those who were screened with magnetic resonance imaging; however, rates of unneeded biopsy were similar69.
Risk-reducing medications (for example, tamoxifen or raloxifene) can increase risk for thromboembolic events (4 to 7 events per 1000 women over 5 years). Tamoxifen increased the risk for endometrial cancer (4 to 5 cases per 1000 women) compared with placebo or raloxifene, and it also increased risk for cataracts (15 per 1000 women) compared with raloxifene26, 65.
Data on the long-term physical harms of risk-reducing mastectomy are limited. In high-risk women having risk-reducing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction, 21% in 1 series had complications (for example, hematoma, contracture, or implant rupture)70. In another series, 64% reported postsurgical symptoms (for example, numbness, pain, tingling, infection, swelling, breast hardness, bleeding, organizing hematoma, failed reconstruction, breathing problems, thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism)71. After risk-reducing oophorectomy, 5% of women in 1 study had postsurgical complications (for example, wound infection, bladder or uterine perforation, or small-bowel obstruction)72.
Seven observational studies provided data on psychological distress due to risk-reducing mastectomy71, 73-76 or oophorectomy25, 77. In 1 study of 90 women who had risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy73, 74, there were significant reductions in scores for anxiety and sexual pleasure and no significant differences in depression scores, body image concerns, or other measures. In another study75, there were no significant differences in psychological measures between women who had risk-reducing mastectomy and a reference sample that did not have the procedure. Ten years after risk-reducing mastectomy, most women in another study reported that their family lives were unchanged, but 39% reported negative effects on spousal relationships because of decreased sensation and changed body appearance76. After risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy, premenopausal women reported significant worsening of vasomotor symptoms and decreased sexual function77.
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
For women whose family history is associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, the USPSTF found adequate evidence that the benefits of testing, detection, and early intervention are moderate. For women whose family history is not associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, the USPSTF found adequate evidence that the benefits of testing, detection, and early intervention are few to none. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the overall harms of testing, detection, and early intervention are small to moderate.
For women whose family history is associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of testing, detection, and early intervention is moderate. For women whose family history is not associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of testing, detection, and early intervention ranges from minimal to potentially harmful.
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are tumor suppressor genes. Mutations of these genes have been linked to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Risks for breast, ovarian, and other types of BRCA-related cancer are greatly increased in patients who have inherited potentially harmful BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Genetic testing may identify such mutations. Several options are available to manage cancer risk in patients who are found to be mutation carriers.
Response to Public Comments
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 2 April through 29 April 2013. In response to comments, the USPSTF clarified that this recommendation statement applies to women. It also expanded the recommendation to include women who have family members with tubal or peritoneal (in addition to breast or ovarian) cancer. The USPSTF clarified that it recognizes the potential importance of further evaluating women who have a diagnosis of breast or ovarian cancer; however, that assessment is part of disease management and is beyond the scope of this recommendation.
The USPSTF added that it found insufficient evidence to recommend one risk assessment tool over another or to support a specific risk threshold for referral for genetic counseling and BRCA testing. It also added a compilation of risk assessment tools (Tables 1 to 5). Although the preferred BRCA testing strategy is initial testing of a family member with breast or ovarian cancer, the USPSTF clarified that it is reasonable to start testing in an unaffected individual if no affected relative is available. Because of the complexity of BRCA test results, the USPSTF also suggests posttest counseling. It also clarified and updated information on BRCA testing, other resources, and recommendations of other groups.",,"Risk Assessment, Genetic Counseling, and Genetic Testing for BRCA-Related Cancer","BRCA-Related Cancer, Risk Assessment, Genetic Counseling, and Genetic Testing, 2013"

<br /><br />
<h3>Patient Population under Consideration</h3>
While the rate of illicit drug use in the U.S. is highest between the ages of 18 to 20 years, more than 10% of adolescents aged 12 to17 are known to use illicit drugs.&nbsp; The percentage of adults who regularly use illicit drugs decreases steadily with age. About 5% of pregnant women report using illicit drugs within the past month.
<h3>Patterns of Drug Use</h3>
Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States, with about 6% of the population age 12 and older admitting to use within the past month. While cocaine is the second most commonly used illicit drug, it is used by less than 1% of the population.&nbsp; Only a small minority of Americans use hallucinogens, inhalants, heroin, or illicitly manufactured methamphetamine, although the potential for abuse of or dependence on these substances is high. &nbsp;Illicit (non-medical) use of prescription-type drugs, categorized as pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives, is a growing health problem in the U.S.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
While clinicians should be alert to the signs and symptoms of illicit drug use in patients, the added benefit of screening asymptomatic patients in primary care practice remains unclear. Toxicologic tests of blood or urine can provide objective evidence of drug use, but such tests do not distinguish between occasional users and those who are impaired by drug use. A few brief, standardized questionnaires have been shown to be valid and reliable in screening adolescent and adult patients for drug use/misuse. However, the clinical utility of these questionnaires is uncertain. The reported positive predictive values are variable and at best 83% when the questionnaires are applied in a general medical clinic. Moreover, the feasibility of routinely incorporating the questionnaires into busy primary care practices has yet to be assessed. The validity, reliability, and clinical utility of standardized questionnaires in screening for illicit drug use during pregnancy have not been adequately evaluated.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
Although drug-specific pharmacotherapy (e.g., buprenorphine for opiate abuse) and/or behavioral interventions (e.g., brief motivational counseling for cannabis misuse) have been proven effective in reducing illicit drug use in the short term, &nbsp;the longer-term effects of treatment on morbidity and mortality have been inadequately evaluated.&nbsp; Moreover, these treatments have been studied almost exclusively in individuals who have already developed medical, social, or legal problems due to drug use, and their effectiveness in individuals identified through screening remains unclear. In all but one trial, treatment was delivered outside the primary care setting, often in specialized treatment facilities. More evidence is needed on the effectiveness of office-based treatments for illicit drug use/dependence.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
While interventions to prevent or reduce illicit drug use have been proposed for use in schools and sites of employment, evidence assessing preventive measures delivered in settings other than primary care practice was outside the scope of the USPSTF review. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Task Force on Community Preventive Services has announced plans to assess the effectiveness of selected population-based interventions for preventing or reducing abuse of drugs (other than tobacco and alcohol) and to make recommendations based on these findings.",http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf08/druguse/drugrs.htm#clinical,82,"<strong>This recommendation was partially updated for children and adolescents in 2014. For updated information on children and adolescents, see</strong><br /><strong><a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsnonmed.htm"">http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsnonmed.htm</a>.</strong><br /><br /><br />Several professional groups have recommended screening adolescents for drug use. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pediatricians incorporate substance-abuse prevention into daily practice, acquire the skills necessary to identify young people at risk of substance abuse, and provide or facilitate assessment, intervention and treatment as necessary. The American Medical Association's (AMA) Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services (GAPS) recommends that providers screen adolescents for substance abuse during annual preventive services visits, using age-specific questionnaires that include items related to drug use in the previous six months (www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/1980.html). In addition, the Bright Futures initiative includes a recommendation that all adolescents be screened for substance use as part of an overall psychosocial history.&nbsp; It suggests that practices use the CRAFFT questionnaire or the patient self-administered Drug and Alcohol Problem Quick Screen (DAP) (www.brightfutures.org). The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) recommends direct questioning by clinicians of all patients about their use of drugs (as well as tobacco and alcohol) as part of periodic assessments.&nbsp; The use of screening instruments adapted from questionnaires initially developed for use in detecting alcohol abuse is suggested, although no specific instrument is specified.",http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf08/druguse/drugrs.htm#recommendations,"<p><strong>Importance:</strong>&nbsp; Illicit drug use and abuse are serious problems among adolescents, adults, and pregnant women in the United States, ranking among the 10 leading preventable risk factors for years of healthy life lost to death and disability in developed countries. &nbsp;(Please note that tobacco use and alcohol misuse are considered in separate screening recommendations of the USPSTF.) <br /><br /><strong>Detection:</strong>&nbsp; While standardized questionnaires to screen adolescents and adults for drug use/misuse have been shown to be valid and reliable, there is insufficient evidence to assess the clinical utility of these instruments when applied widely in primary care settings. <br /><br /><strong>Benefits of detection and early treatment:</strong>&nbsp; There is good evidence that various treatments are effective in reducing illicit drug use in the short term. Evidence is insufficient, however, either to demonstrate that treatment reliably improves social and legal outcomes for patients, or to link treatment directly to longer term improvements in morbidity or mortality. Since all but one published clinical trial of treatment interventions involved individuals who had already developed problems due to their drug use, it is not known whether the findings are generalizable to asymptomatic individuals whose illicit drug use is detected through screening. There is fair evidence that, regardless of the patient's history of treatment, reducing or stopping drug use is associated with improvement in some health outcomes.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>Harms of detection and early treatment: </strong>&nbsp;There is little evidence of harms associated with either screening for illicit drug use or behavioral interventions used in treatment. Several clinical trials of pharmacotherapy for drug misuse have reported mild to serious adverse events, although some of these events were likely related to underlying drug use. The specific adverse events noted to occur more frequently in the treatment arm of trials (compared to placebo) have been previously recognized as potential side effects of the treatment medication and cited on its product label. <br /><br /><strong>USPSTF assessment:</strong> The USPSTF concludes that for&nbsp;adults and pregnant women, the evidence is insufficient to determine the benefits and harms of screening for illicit drug use.&nbsp; <em><br /><br />This recommendation was partially updated for children and adolescents in 2014.

"<h3>Patient Population under Consideration</h3> <p>This recommendation addresses screening for bacterial
vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant women.</p>
 <h3>Risk Assessment</h3>
<p>Several factors have been associated with increased risk
for preterm delivery. All of these associations are small to
moderate. These factors include, but are not limited to,
African-American race or ethnicity, body mass index less
than 20 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, previous preterm delivery, vaginal bleeding,
a short cervix (&lt;2.5 cm), pelvic infection, and bacterial
vaginosis. These factors can act in isolation or in combination.
Furthermore, bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy is
more common among African-American women, women
of low socioeconomic status, and those who have previously
delivered low-birthweight infants. For the purpose of
the current recommendation, women were considered to
be at low risk if they had no previous preterm delivery or
other risk factors for preterm delivery (often these were
nulliparous women). Women were considered to be at
high risk if they had a previous preterm delivery.</p>
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
<p>Bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed by using the Amsel
clinical criteria or Gram stain. With the Amsel criteria, the
clinical diagnosis is made by fulfilling 3 of 4 criteria: vaginal
pH greater than 4.7, the presence of clue cells on wet
mount, thin homogeneous discharge, and amine &quot;fishy
odor&quot; when potassium hydroxide is added to the discharge.</p>
<h3>Suggestions for Practice</h3>
<p>This recommendation statement addresses screening for
bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic women. Treatment of
symptomatic cases should be based on the clinical situation.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Oral metronidazole and oral clindamycin, as well as
vaginal metronidazole gel or clindamycin cream, are used
to treat bacterial vaginosis. The optimal treatment regimen
for pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis is unclear.
Refer to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Web site for current treatment recommendations (www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2006/vaginal-discharge.htm#vagdis2).</p>
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
 <h3>Research Needs</h3> <p> 
There are several evidence gaps in the literature on screening
and treating bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant
women. A critical gap in the evidence exists in demonstrating
a benefit of treatment in asymptomatic pregnant women at
increased risk for preterm delivery. Available evidence on
treatment benefit is conflicting. Additional research is needed
to evaluate the benefit of screening and treating asymptomatic
bacterial vaginosis in women at highest risk for preterm delivery.
Research is also needed to assess which screening tests
providers use to diagnose bacterial vaginosis in clinical practice
and the accuracy of these tests. Finally, continued research is
needed to determine the optimal treatment regimen for bacterial
vaginosis.</p>",http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf08/bv/bvrs.htm#clinical,83,"<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group,
the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV/Clinical
Effectiveness Group, and the American Academy of
Family Physicians make similar recommendations about
screening and treatment of pregnant women with bacterial
vaginosis. All recommend against routine screening
for bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant women.
With respect to women at high risk for preterm delivery,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American
Academy of Family Physicians, and British Association for
Sexual Health and HIV state that there may be high-risk
women for whom screening and treatment may be beneficial.

"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
The focus of this recommendation is healthy adults without special nutritional needs. Populations studied were typically aged 50 years or older. This recommendation does not apply to children, women who are pregnant or may become pregnant, or persons who are chronically ill or hospitalized or have a known nutritional deficiency.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4><em>Potential Preventable Burden </em></h4>
Evidence from in vitro and animal research and population-based epidemiologic studies supports the hypothesis that oxidative stress may play a fundamental role in the initiation and progression of cancer and common cardiovascular diseases. If this hypothesis is correct, then some combination of specific supplements, a specific dose, a vulnerable host, and specific timing may be found to be useful.
<h4><em>Potential Harms</em></h4>
Important harms have been shown with the use of &beta;-carotene in persons who smoke tobacco or have an occupational exposure to asbestos. There are several known adverse effects caused by excessive doses of vitamins; for example, moderate doses of vitamin A supplements may reduce bone mineral density, but high doses may be hepatotoxic or teratogenic. Otherwise, the vitamins reviewed by the USPSTF had few known risks. Because many of these vitamins are fat soluble, the lifetime effect of high doses should be taken into consideration.<br /><br />The USPSTF did not address doses higher than the tolerable upper intake level, as determined by the U.S. Food and Nutrition Board. Vitamins A and D have known harms at doses exceeding the tolerable upper intake levels, and the potential for harm from other supplements at high doses should be carefully considered. <br /><br />The U.S. Pharmacopeia has developed reference standards to aid in quality control of dietary supplement production; however, the content and concentration of ingredients in commercially available formulations probably vary considerably. This variability in the composition of dietary supplements makes extrapolating results obtained from controlled clinical trials challenging.
<h4><em>Costs </em></h4>
Although dietary supplements themselves are not particularly costly, the cumulative effect of this class of agent on spending is substantial. In 2010, $28.1 billion was spent on dietary supplements in the United States.
<h4><em>Current Practice </em></h4>
Surveys conducted by the dietary supplement industry suggest that many physicians and nurses have recommended dietary supplements to their patients for health and wellness.
<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>
Appropriate intake of vitamin and mineral nutrients is essential to overall health. Despite the uncertain benefit of vitamin supplementation, the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggest that nutrients should come primarily from foods and provide guidance on how to consume a nutrient-rich diet. Adequate nutrition by eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fat-free and low-fat dairy products, and seafood has been associated with a reduced risk for cardiovascular disease and cancer. <br /><br />Specific groups of patients with well-defined conditions may benefit from specific nutrients. For example, women planning or capable of pregnancy should receive a daily supplement containing folic acid to help prevent neural tube defects. The USPSTF also recommends vitamin D supplements for older persons at risk for falling.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The USPSTF has a large portfolio of recommendations for prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer, including recommendations for smoking cessation; screening for lipid disorders, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer; obesity screening and counseling; and aspirin use (available at <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>). <br /><br />
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
A critical gap in the evidence is the lack of studies of multivitamin combinations in groups generalizable to the U.S. population. Two randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) of multivitamin supplements suggest a potential cancer prevention benefit in men but not women. Future trials should be more representative of the general population, including women and minority groups, and should have enough power to show whether there are true subgroup differences. Targeting research toward persons who can be identified as high-risk for nutrient deficiency rather than the general population may be more productive. <br /><br />There are substantial challenges to studying nutrient supplementation by using methods similar to those used in studying pharmaceutical interventions. New and innovative research methods for examining effects of nutrients that account for the unique complexities of nutritional research but maintain rigorous designs should be explored. <br /><br />The paucity of studies and general lack of effect of any single nutrient or nutrient pair makes it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions on the balance of benefits and harms without a coordinated research effort and focus. A general lack of standardized methods to determine relevant serum nutrient levels, agreement on thresholds for sufficiency and insufficiency, or predictive validity of current mechanistic models further hinders progress in understanding potential benefits of dietary supplements.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf14/vitasupp/vitasuppfinalrs.htm#consider,139,"An independent consensus panel sponsored by the National Institutes of Health concluded that the present evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against the use of multivitamins to prevent chronic disease. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (formerly the American Dietetic Association) noted in a 2009 position statement that, although multivitamin supplements may be useful in meeting the recommended levels of some nutrients, there is no evidence that they are effective in preventing chronic disease. <br /><br />The American Cancer Society found that current evidence does not support the use of dietary supplements for the prevention of cancer. The American Institute for Cancer Research determined in 2007 that dietary supplements are not recommended for cancer prevention and recommended a balanced diet with a variety of foods rather than supplements. <br /><br />The American Heart Association recommends that healthy persons receive adequate nutrients by eating a variety of foods rather than supplementation. The American Academy of Family Physicians' clinical recommendations are consistent with the USPSTF recommendations.","Burden of Disease

	Cardiovascular disease and cancer are the largest contributors to the burden of chronic disease in the developed world. In 2011, these diseases accounted for 23.7% and 22.8% of all deaths in the United States, respectively 11.

	Scope of Review

	In order to update its 2003 recommendation, the USPSTF reviewed evidence of the efficacy of the use of multivitamin or mineral supplements in the general adult population for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer 3,  12. The value of vitamins that naturally occur in food and the use of vitamin supplements for the prevention of other conditions (for example, neural tube defects) and for the secondary prevention of complications in patients with existing disease are outside the scope of this review.

	Effectiveness of Preventive Medication

Multivitamin and Antioxidant Combinations

	The USPSTF reviewed 4 RCTs and 1 cohort study assessing health outcomes of a multivitamin supplement 3. The studies varied in the nutrients and doses used. No effect on all-cause mortality was found in the 3 trials that assessed this outcome. Two trials assessed cardiovascular disease outcomes. Overall, there was no effect on incidence of cardiovascular disease events. One trial reported a borderline significant decrease in fatal myocardial infarctions.

	Two large trials, the Physicians' Health Study II 13 and the SU.VI.MAX (Supplementation in Vitamins and Mineral Antioxidants) study 14, showed a decrease in overall cancer incidence in men (pooled unadjusted relative risk, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.87 to 0.99]) 3. The Physicians' Health Study II included 14,641 male U.S. physicians with an average age of 64.3 years. The intervention used a commercially available multivitamin that contained 30 ingredients. The unadjusted relative risk for total cancer incidence was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.00) after 11.2 years of follow-up. The homogeneity of this study population (primarily older white male physicians) limits its generalizability.

	The SU.VI.MAX study was conducted in France in 13,017 men and women with an average age of 49 years. The intervention supplement included nutritional doses of vitamins C and E plus β-carotene, selenium, and zinc. Outcomes were reported for the end of the intervention phase at 7.5 years and again at 12.5 years after randomization. During the supplementation period, overall cancer incidence was not affected in women but decreased by 31% in men (adjusted relative risk, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.53 to 0.91]). The lack of effect in women and the use of different supplement formulations in the 2 trials make extrapolating these findings to the general population difficult.

Single and Paired Vitamins and Minerals

	The USPSTF reviewed 24 studies of individual vitamins or minerals or functional nutrient pairs 3. Across all of the supplements studied, there was no evidence of beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease, cancer, or all-cause mortality. However, there are only a limited number of studies for most individual nutrients and differences in study designs make pooling effects across supplements difficult. Therefore, the USPSTF is not able to conclude with certainty that there is no effect. The evidence for each individual nutrient is discussed here.

Vitamin A. The USPSTF reviewed 3 RCTs and 2 cohort studies of vitamin A 3. None of the studies reported cardiovascular disease incidence. One good-quality trial showed an increased risk for lung cancer and related death. The baseline population (smokers and workers who had been exposed to asbestos) was at high risk for lung cancer, so the increased mortality may be attributable to the β-carotene component. Two trials reported all-cause mortality, but no significant difference was observed between intervention and control groups at the longest follow-up. Increased risk for hip fractures was observed in 1 large prospective cohort study of postmenopausal women.

Vitamin C. Two RCTs studied the effects of vitamin C, either alone or in combination with other supplements, and found no statistically significant effect on cardiovascular disease, cancer, or all-cause mortality 3.

Vitamin D With or Without Calcium. Three trials studied the effects of vitamin D on cardiovascular disease and cancer 3. Two trials found no effect on cardiovascular disease incidence or mortality. One trial reported cancer incidence and death and found no difference between intervention and control groups. Two trials reporting all-cause mortality found no statistically significant difference.

	Two trials studied vitamin D and calcium combined. One small, fair-quality study found a statistically significant decreased risk for cancer with supplement use 15. The WHI (Women's Health Initiative) trial, a larger, good-quality trial using lower doses of vitamin D and calcium supplements, found no effect on cancer incidence or mortality 16. A post hoc subgroup analysis of women who were not receiving supplements at baseline showed an association between use of vitamin D and calcium supplements and lower total cancer and breast cancer incidence 17.

	Only the WHI trial reported cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality and all-cause mortality, and it found no effect after 7 years of follow-up. Four trials of calcium supplementation found no effect on overall cardiovascular disease, cancer, or all-cause mortality 3.

Vitamin E. Six RCTs assessed vitamin E supplementation 3. Three trials reported cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality. One trial in women reported a lower cardiovascular disease mortality rate in the intervention group, but mortality rates for myocardial infarction and stroke did not differ statistically. One trial found an increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke in the intervention group.

	Four RCTs reported cancer incidence. Overall, there was no significant effect on incidence of all types of cancer or on cancer mortality rates. No effect on all-cause mortality was observed in the 5 trials reporting this outcome.

	Vitamin E was not found to have any effect on site-specific cancer incidence, although the results for prostate cancer were mixed. The ATBC (Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention) study 18 reported a decreased incidence of prostate cancer, but the effect did not persist with longer follow-up. Conversely, SELECT (Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial) 19 reported an increased risk for prostate cancer after extended follow-up.

β-Carotene. A consistent body of evidence from 6 clinical trials suggests that β-carotene supplementation does not decrease the risk for cardiovascular disease events, overall cancer incidence, or cancer mortality 3. Two trials, the ATBC study 18 and CARET (Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial) 20, showed an increased risk for lung cancer incidence and mortality and all-cause mortality in participants with a high baseline risk for lung cancer. A meta-analysis of β-carotene trials reported an increased risk for lung cancer (pooled odds ratio, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.10 to 1.39]) in current smokers 21.

Selenium. Two trials studied selenium alone or in combination with other nutrients and found no effect on cardiovascular disease or all-cause mortality 3. The effect on cancer was mixed. One trial found a decrease in risk for cancer incidence and mortality; the other found no significant difference. Additional analyses showed a decrease in cancer incidence only in men with the lowest levels of selenium, suggesting a potential effect resulting from treatment of selenium deficiency. No differences in all-cause mortality were found in either trial.

Folic Acid. Only 1 trial studied folic acid 3. It found no effect on cardiovascular disease incidence or all-cause mortality. There was an increased incidence of cancer, attributed to an excess number of deaths from prostate cancer in the intervention group.

	Potential Harms of Preventive Medication

	Overall, few significant harms were reported from these interventions except for β-carotene. As described previously, 2 trials reported increased risk for lung cancer and lung cancer mortality in smokers, especially heavy smokers. No trials observed an increased risk for cancer in nonsmokers.

	The literature contains reports of less serious harms, such as hypercarotenemia or yellowing of the skin (multivitamins and β-carotene), rashes (multivitamins), minor bleeding events (multivitamins), and gastrointestinal symptoms (calcium and selenium). Rare but more serious harms were associated with some nutrient trials, including hip fractures (vitamin A), prostate cancer (folic acid), and kidney stones (vitamin D and calcium).

	Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit

	The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the effectiveness of multivitamin supplements to prevent cardiovascular disease or cancer. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence is lacking and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. The USPSTF also found inadequate evidence on the effectiveness of supplementation with most single or paired vitamins or minerals and is therefore unable to determine the balance of benefits and harms of their use to prevent cardiovascular disease or cancer.

	Only 2 vitamin supplements have sufficient data to estimate net benefit. β-Carotene has been associated with a statistically significant increased risk for lung cancer in smokers. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of β-carotene supplementation is negative (that is, there is a net harm).

	A large and consistent body of evidence has shown that vitamin E supplementation has no effect on cardiovascular disease, cancer, or all-cause mortality. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of vitamin E supplementation is zero.

	How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?

	The risk factors for cardiovascular disease are well-established. Risk factors for cancer are considerably more complex because of the heterogeneous nature of different types of cancer and environmental and genetic influences. Inflammation, oxidative stress, and methionine metabolism have been theorized as common pathologic mechanisms for cardiovascular disease and cancer.

	The potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of many nutrient supplements are the basis for their proposed use to prevent cardiovascular disease and cancer 3. The oxidative properties of antioxidants are not fully understood; however, research has suggested that these properties may vary in relation to other factors, such as the concentration of the nutrient and presence of other oxidants or antioxidants. The harmful association between β-carotene and lung cancer suggests that other variables may influence whether β-carotene acts as an antioxidant versus a pro-oxidant.

	Response to Public Comments

	A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 12 November to 9 December 2013. In response to these comments, the USPSTF added language emphasizing that the harms of β-carotene were found in persons at increased risk for lung cancer. The discussion of vitamin E was revised to clarify the consistency of evidence showing a lack of benefit. Additional language was added to the Research Needs and Gaps section to highlight other challenges in nutrient research. The Recommendations of Others section was enhanced with recommendations from additional organizations.

"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
These recommendations apply to pregnant women who have not been previously diagnosed with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
Several factors increase a woman's risk for developing GDM, including obesity, increased maternal age, history of GDM, family history of diabetes, and belonging to an ethnic group that has increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (Hispanic, Native American, South or East Asian, African American, or Pacific Island descent).<br /><br />Factors associated with a lower risk for developing GDM include age younger than 25 to 30 years, white race, a body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2or less, no family history (that is, in a first-degree relative) of diabetes, and no history of glucose intolerance or adverse pregnancy outcomes related to GDM.
<h3>Screening</h3>
There are 2 strategies used to screen for gestational diabetes in the United States. In the 2-step approach, the 50-g OGCT is performed between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation in a nonfasting state. If the screening threshold is met or exceeded (130, 135, or 140 mg/dL [7.21, 7.49, or 7.77 mmol/L]), patients receive the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). During the OGTT, a fasting glucose level is obtained, followed by administration of a 100-g glucose load, and glucose levels are evaluated after 1, 2, and 3 hours. A diagnosis of GDM is made when 2 or more glucose values fall at or above the specified glucose thresholds. Alternatively, in the 1-step approach, a 75-g glucose load is administered after fasting and plasma glucose levels are evaluated after 1 and 2 hours. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed if 1 glucose value falls at or above the specified glucose threshold.
<h3>Timing of Screening</h3>
Screening is recommended after 24 weeks of gestation. Screening for GDM may occur earlier than 24 weeks of gestation in high-risk women, but there is little evidence about the benefits and harms of screening before 24 weeks of gestation.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
Initial treatment includes moderate physical activity, dietary changes, support from diabetes educators and nutritionists, and glucose monitoring. If the patient's glucose is not controlled after these initial interventions, she may be prescribed medication (either insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents), or have increased surveillance in prenatal care or changes in delivery management.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
In deciding whether to screen for GDM before 24 weeks of gestation, primary care providers should consider the following.
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
Gestational diabetes affects about 240,000 (7%) of the 4 million annual births in the United States. Pregnant women with GDM are at increased risk for maternal and fetal complications and may benefit from early identification and treatment. Women with GDM are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
Potential harms of screening for gestational diabetes include psychological harms and intensive medical interventions (induction of labor, cesarean delivery, or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit). Possible adverse effects of treatment include neonatal or maternal hypoglycemia and maternal stress.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
A cross-sectional study reported that universal screening is the most common practice in the United States, with 96% of obstetricians routinely screening for GDM. Some women are screened earlier than 24 weeks of gestation because they have risk factors for type 2 diabetes, such as obesity, family history of type 2 diabetes, or fetal macrosomia during a previous pregnancy. <br /><br />If a pregnant woman presents in the first trimester or in early pregnancy with risk factors for type 2 diabetes, clinicians should use their clinical judgment to determine what is appropriate screening for that individual patient given her health needs and the insufficient evidence.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
Most pregnant women should be encouraged to attain moderate gestational weight gain, based on their prepregnancy BMI, and to participate in physical activity based on their clinician's recommendations. The Institute of Medicine has made recommendations for weight gain during pregnancy based on prepregnancy BMI.<a name=""other""></a>
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
More research is needed to directly evaluate screening for GDM and maternal and infant health outcomes. Research is also needed to help determine the most beneficial glucose thresholds for a positive screen and treatment targets. Continued research is needed to examine alternative screening methods, such as glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measurement and risk factor&#8210;based assessment. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the effect of different treatments for GDM on longer-term metabolic maternal and infant outcomes, such as persistent maternal glucose intolerance after delivery and type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity in the mother and infant. The use of a consistent strategy for screening for and diagnosing GDM in studies would allow for better comparisons of treatment outcomes across clinical trials. <br /><br />The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in women of reproductive age merits consideration of preconception screening for overt diabetes in women who are at risk for type 2 diabetes. Additional studies are needed to determine whether identifying and treating glucose intolerance before 24 weeks of gestation reduces maternal and fetal complications at delivery or leads to improved long-term health outcomes. For example, a follow-up to the Mild GDM Trial is examining whether different types of interventions in pregnant women with mild GDM decreases the risk for obesity in their children.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/gdm/gdmfinalrs.htm#consider,138,"In 2013, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended screening all pregnant women with a patient history or the 50-g OGCT. The American Diabetes Association endorses glucose testing for GDM in all pregnant women who do not have a prepregnancy diagnosis of diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation using a 75-g 2-hour OGTT with thresholds proposed by the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups. In 2013, an independent panel supported by the National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Program considered whether using the 75-g OGTT (1-step approach), as proposed by the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups and supported by the American Diabetes Association, should be adopted instead of the 2-step approach. The panel released a statement that there is not enough evidence to adopt a 1-step approach. The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends screening for GDM in asymptomatic pregnant women after 24 weeks of gestation. It also concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for GDM in asymptomatic pregnant women before 24 weeks of gestation. The Endocrine Society recommends universal screening for GDM using the OGTT at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/gdm/gdmfinalrs.htm#recommendations,,Screening for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus,"Gestational Diabetes Mellitus, Screening, 2014"

<h3><strong>Patient Population Under Consideration</strong></h3>
This recommendation applies to pregnant women, new mothers, and their infants and children. Interventions to support breastfeeding may also involve a woman's partner, other family members, and friends. This recommendation does not apply in circumstances where there are contraindications to breastfeeding (e.g., certain maternal medical conditions or infant metabolic disorders, such as galactosemia). The USPSTF did not review evidence on interventions directed at breastfeeding of preterm infants.
<h3><strong>Interventions</strong></h3>
Breastfeeding support can begin during pregnancy and continue through the early life of the child. Primary care clinicians can support women before and after childbirth by providing interventions directly or through referral to help them make an informed choice about how to feed their infants and to be successful in their choice. Interventions include promoting the benefits of breastfeeding, providing practical advice and direct support on how to breastfeed, and providing psychological support. Interventions can be categorized as professional support, peer support, and formal education, although none of these categories are mutually exclusive, and interventions may be combined within and between categories.
<h4><em>Professional Support</em></h4>
Professional support is 1-on-1 counseling about breastfeeding provided by a health professional (medical, nursing, or allied professionals, including those providing lactation care). Some interventions include the provision of supplies, such as educational materials, nursing bras, and breast pumps. Professional support can include providing information about the benefits of breastfeeding, psychological support (encouraging the mother, providing reassurance, and discussing the mother&rsquo;s questions and problems), and direct support during breastfeeding observations (helping with the positioning of the infant and observing latching). Professional support may be delivered during pregnancy, the hospital stay, the postpartum period, or at multiple stages. It may be conducted in an office setting, in the hospital, through home visits, through telephone support, or any combination of these. Sessions generally last from 15 to 45 minutes, although some programs have used shorter or longer sessions. Most successful interventions include multiple sessions and are delivered at more than 1 point in time.
<h4><em>Peer Support</em></h4>
Similar to professional support, peer support provides women with 1-on-1 counseling about breastfeeding but is delivered by a layperson (generally a mother with successful breastfeeding experience and a background similar to that of the patient) who has received training in how to provide support. Like professional support, peer support may be delivered through a variety of stages, settings, methods, and durations.
<h4><em>Formal Education</em></h4>
Formal education interventions typically include a formalized program to convey general breastfeeding knowledge, most often in the prenatal period, although some may span time periods. Education is usually offered in group sessions and may include telephone support, electronic interventions, videos, and print materials. They are directed at mothers but may include other family members. Content generally focuses on the benefits of breastfeeding, practical breastfeeding skills (e.g., latching), and the management of common breastfeeding complications; these programs may also offer family members encouragement and advice on how to support the mother.
<h3><strong>Useful Resources</strong></h3>
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides information on different breastfeeding intervention strategies, including program examples and resources.<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation2"">2</a>&nbsp;Another resource is the Surgeon General&rsquo;s ""Call to Action to Support Breastfeeding"".<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation3"">3</a></div>",,173,"<h3><em><strong>Other Considerations</strong></em></h3>
<h3><strong>Implementation</strong></h3>
<p>Although there is moderate certainty that breastfeeding is of moderate net benefit to women and their infants and children, not all women choose to or are able to breastfeed. Clinicians should, as with any preventive service, respect the autonomy of women and their families to make decisions that fit their specific situation, values, and preferences.In addition to clinicians&rsquo; direct activities to support breastfeeding, there are system-level interventions intended to promote breastfeeding. System-level interventions include policies, programs, and staff training, usually implemented within hospitals or health care systems. The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative is the most widely implemented system-level intervention and is based on the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund (UNICEF) ""10 Steps to Successful Breastfeeding for Hospitals"".<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation4"">4</a>&nbsp;Other system-level interventions include maternity care practices such as encouraging skin-to-skin contact, rooming-in, restricted pacifier use, and distributing breast pumps. Community-based interventions include social marketing initiatives, workplace initiatives, and public policy actions. A comprehensive review of the evidence on the effectiveness of these types of system-level interventions for the purposes of making a recommendation is beyond the scope of the USPSTF. A focused review of system-level interventions is included in the full evidence report,<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation5"">5</a>and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also provides information about individual, system-level, and community-based interventions.<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation6"">6</a></p>
<h3><strong>Research Needs and Gaps</strong></h3>
<p>To better assess how population-level interventions would affect breastfeeding rates, future studies should include women who have not already declared their intention to breastfeed. To better understand the effects of different interventions and patient populations, future research should include adequate sample sizes, clear descriptions of the included populations and comparators, and standardized reporting of outcomes. Studies would be more useful if they are designed to allow assessment of the relative contributions of individual components of multicomponent breastfeeding support programs. Trials should include reliable and valid measures of infant and maternal health outcomes and be powered to detect potential effects on these outcomes. Studies also should explore maternal satisfaction with the intervention and any potential negative feelings or feelings of inadequacy that could result if mothers choose not to or are unable to breastfeed. Studies in populations with low breastfeeding rates are especially needed, and more research is needed to better understand the root causes of breastfeeding disparities and how they can be addressed through health care and community interventions. Other areas for research include the potential benefits and harms of supporting indirect breastfeeding (e.g., use of breast pumps), the role of breastfeeding support for adoptive or surrogate families, the role of systems to distribute donor breast milk, and the effect of new technologies to support breastfeeding (e.g., web- or computer-based interventions).</p>
<h3><em>Update of USPSTF Recommendations</em></h3>
<p>This recommendation updates the 2008 USPSTF recommendation on primary care interventions to promote and support breastfeeding. The scope of the review and type of interventions recommended did not change. The grade of the recommendation remains a B.</p>
<h3><em>Recommendations of Others</em></h3>
<p>Several national and international organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP),<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation15"">15</a>&nbsp;the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG),<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation16"">16</a>&nbsp;and WHO/UNICEF,<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation17"">17</a>&nbsp;recommend exclusive breastfeeding up to around 6 months, followed by continued breastfeeding for at least 1 year, as mutually desired by mother and infant, while complementary foods are introduced. ACOG also recommends that all obstetrician-gynecologists and other providers of obstetric care develop and maintain knowledge and skills in anticipatory guidance and support each woman&rsquo;s informed decision about whether to initiate or continue breastfeeding. ACOG endorses the integration of the WHO/UNICEF ""10 Steps to Successful Breastfeeding"" into maternity care to increase the likelihood that women achieve their personal breastfeeding goals.<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation16"">16</a>&nbsp;AAP recommends that pediatricians serve as breastfeeding advocates and educators, provides resources that pediatricians can use in their practices, and endorses the WHO/UNICEF ""10 Steps to Successful Breastfeeding"".<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation15"">15</a>&nbsp;The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends providing interventions during pregnancy and after birth to support breastfeeding.<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation18"">18</a>&nbsp;The National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners endorses the optimization of infant breastfeeding and breastfeeding promotion as part of pediatric care.<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation19"">19</a>&nbsp;In 2011, the US Surgeon General issued a call to action that clinicians, health systems, community programs, and government policy support women who choose to breastfeed.<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation3"">3</a></p>","Benefits of Breastfeeding
A history of being breastfed has been found to be associated with a reduced risk of a variety of negative health outcomes in infancy and childhood, including illnesses such as acute otitis media, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and gastrointestinal tract infection, and chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure.5, 7 Although the majority of studies are observational and definitions and comparisons vary widely, any breastfeeding appears to be more beneficial than no breastfeeding, and longer durations of breastfeeding confer greater benefits than shorter durations. Breastfeeding is also associated with positive maternal health outcomes, such as reduced risk of maternal breast and ovarian cancer and type 2 diabetes.
Breastfeeding Rates
Estimates for any breastfeeding among infants born in 2012 in the United States were 80.0% for initiation, 51.4% at 6 months, and 29.2% at 12 months. Rates of exclusive breastfeeding through 3 and 6 months were 43.3% and 21.9%, respectively.1 These rates have been increasing over the past few decades but are still less than the Healthy People 2020 targets for initiating breastfeeding (81.9%), breastfeeding to 6 months (60.6%), and breastfeeding to 12 months (34.1%). Targets for exclusive breastfeeding at 3 and 6 months are 46% and 25%, respectively.8
Scope of Review
The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to update its 2008 recommendation on primary care interventions to promote breastfeeding.5, 7 This update focused on the effectiveness of interventions to support breastfeeding on breastfeeding initiation, duration, and exclusivity. The USPSTF briefly reviewed the literature on the effects of breastfeeding on child and maternal health outcomes published since the previous review to ensure that there have been no major changes in the direction of the evidence but did not formally assess the literature. The population of interest included mothers of full- or near-term infants and members of the mother-infant support system (e.g., partners, grandparents, or friends). The review used a broad conception of primary care interventions that encompassed activities initiated, conducted, or referred by primary care clinicians.
Effectiveness of Interventions to Change Behavior and Outcomes
The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to determine the direct effects of interventions to support breastfeeding on child and maternal health outcomes. Six trials reported inconsistent effects of counseling interventions on a range of infant health outcomes, including gastrointestinal illness, otitis media, respiratory tract illness, and health care use. None of the studies reported maternal health outcomes.5, 9-14
However, the USPSTF found evidence that interventions to support breastfeeding can increase the rate and duration of breastfeeding. An analysis of 43 trials found that breastfeeding support and education interventions targeting women were associated with a higher likelihood of any and exclusive breastfeeding at less than 3 months and at 3 to 6 months compared with usual care. Pooled estimates indicate a beneficial association for any breastfeeding at less than 3 months (risk ratio [RR], 1.07 [95% CI, 1.03 to 1.11]; 26 studies) and at 3 to 6 months (RR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.04 to 1.18]; 23 studies) and for exclusive breastfeeding at less than 3 months (RR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.11 to 1.33]; 22 studies) and at 3 to 6 months (RR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.05 to 1.38]; 18 studies). At 6 months, individual-level interventions among women were associated with a 16% higher likelihood of exclusive breastfeeding (RR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.02 to 1.32]; 17 studies) but not any breastfeeding. The association between individual-level interventions and breastfeeding initiation was not significant, based on the pooled point estimate (RR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.99 to 1.02]; 14 studies).5 Based on these data, it can be projected that for every 30 women offered support, 1 additional woman will breastfeed for up to 6 months.
Despite great variation in interventions and study design, there was little evidence that the effects of individual-level interventions vary across different populations or intervention characteristics, although the variability may have masked such relationships. There was some suggestion that interventions taking place during a combination of prenatal, peripartum, or postpartum time periods were more effective than those taking place only during 1 time period. Some data also suggested that interventions are effective in both adolescents and adults. All 4 trials of individual-level interventions among adolescents or young adults reported higher rates of breastfeeding among intervention versus control group participants.
Potential Harms of Interventions to Support Breastfeeding
There are very few data on the potential harms of interventions to support breastfeeding, which in theory could include guilt related to not breastfeeding, increased anxiety about breastfeeding, and increased postpartum depression. Only 2 trials among adults reported on adverse events related to a breastfeeding support intervention. One trial found no significant differences in maternal anxiety between groups at 2 weeks. The other trial reported that a few mothers expressed feelings of anxiety and decreased confidence in their breastfeeding ability despite breastfeeding going well and discontinued their participation in the peer counseling intervention.
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
There is adequate evidence that interventions to support breastfeeding change behavior and that the harms of these interventions are no greater than small. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that interventions to support breastfeeding have a moderate net benefit.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from April 26 to May 23, 2016. Many comments expressed concern that the recommendation did not explicitly include the term ""promotion"" of breastfeeding. The USPSTF interprets support as including promotion. The USPSTF revised the recommendation statement to clarify that it has not changed its confidence in the benefits of breastfeeding and that it continues to recommend interventions to encourage breastfeeding. The USPSTF also clarified that there has been no change from the previous recommendation in the type of interventions being recommended. Other comments expressed concern that the recommendation would lead to undue pressure on women who decide not to breastfeed. The USPSTF reviewed the language in the recommendation to ensure that the autonomy of women is respected. Comments also requested that the USPSTF address policy- and society-level barriers to breastfeeding; although these are indeed important issues, they are beyond the scope of the USPSTF.","<h3><strong>Importance</strong></h3>
<p>There is convincing evidence that breastfeeding provides substantial health benefits for children and adequate evidence that breastfeeding provides moderate health benefits for women. However, nearly half of all mothers in the United States who initially breastfeed stop doing so by 6 months, and there are significant disparities in breastfeeding rates among younger mothers and in disadvantaged communities.<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation1"">1</a></p>
<h3><strong>Effectiveness of Interventions to Change Behavior</strong></h3>

"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults 18 years and older at increased risk for tuberculosis (see the &ldquo;Assessment of Risk&rdquo; section for more information). It does not apply to adults with symptoms of tuberculosis or to children and adolescents.</p>
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
<p>Populations at increased risk for LTBI based on increased prevalence of active disease and increased risk of exposure include persons who were born in, or are former residents of, countries with increased tuberculosis prevalence and persons who live in, or have lived in, high-risk congregate settings (eg, homeless shelters and correctional facilities). Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at risk in their community, because local demographic patterns may vary across the United States.In 2015, among persons of known national origin, 66.2% of all active tuberculosis cases in the United States were among foreign-born persons, and the case rate of active tuberculosis among foreign-born persons was approximately 13 times higher than among US-born persons (15.1 vs 1.2 cases per 100,000 persons).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation7"">7</a>&nbsp;More than half of all foreign-born persons in the United States with active tuberculosis were from 5 countries: Mexico, the Philippines, Vietnam, India, and China.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation7"">7</a>&nbsp;In addition, the CDC has identified foreign-born persons from Haiti and Guatemala as important contributors to active tuberculosis cases in the United States.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation8"">8</a>&nbsp;The World Health Organization (WHO) recently updated its list of countries with a high burden of tuberculosis to include the top 20 countries with the highest absolute numbers of cases and an additional 10 countries with the most severe burden in terms of case rate per capita.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation9"">9</a>Persons who live in, or have lived in, high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and increased risk for exposure. Among persons 15 years and older with active tuberculosis, 5.6% were homeless within the past year, 2.2% were residents of a long-term care facility, and 4.2% were in a correctional facility at the time of diagnosis.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation10"">10</a>&nbsp;Published prevalence rates of LTBI in these settings vary widely, depending on the type of screening test used, the TST threshold used to define the presence of LTBI, and the population studied. Estimates of LTBI prevalence range from 23.1% to 87.6% among prisoners and from 18.6% to 79.8% among persons who are homeless.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation2"">2</a>, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation11"">11</a>Other populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who are immunosuppressed (eg, persons living with human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important subgroup.Persons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Since screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation12"">12</a>&nbsp;or employee health<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation13"">13</a>, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation14"">14</a>&nbsp;surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations. Clinicians seeking further information about testing for tuberculosis in these populations can refer to the &ldquo;Useful Resources&rdquo; and &ldquo;Recommendations of Others&rdquo; sections.</p>
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
<p>Two types of screening tests for LTBI are currently available in the United States: the TST and IGRA. The TST requires intradermal placement of purified protein derivative and interpretation of response 48 to 72 hours later. The skin test reaction is measured in millimeters of the induration (a palpable, raised, hardened area or swelling). Interferon-gamma release assays require a single venous blood sample and laboratory processing within 8 to 30 hours after collection. Two types of IGRAs are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration: T-SPOT.<em>TB</em> (Oxford Immunotec Global) and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (Qiagen).Numerous patient and systems factors may influence the selection of a screening test.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation15"">15</a> Generally, the CDC recommends screening with either the TST or IGRA but not both. Testing with IGRAs may be preferable for persons who have received a bacille Calmette&ndash;Gu&eacute;rin vaccination or persons who may be unlikely to return for TST interpretation. Additional information on the use and interpretation of the TST and IGRA is available from the CDC.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation16"">16</a></p>
<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found no evidence on the optimal frequency of screening for LTBI. Depending on specific risk factors, screening frequency could range from 1-time only screening among persons who are at low risk for future tuberculosis exposure to annual screening among those who are at continued risk of exposure.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Recommendations for the treatment of LTBI are available from the CDC.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation17"">17</a></p>
<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>
<p>The public health system has an essential role in the control and elimination of tuberculosis. Clinicians are required to report cases of active tuberculosis to their local health department. As outlined by local and state public health laws, local health departments investigate and ensure treatment of active tuberculosis cases and perform contact tracing and medical surveillance of contacts.Occupational health services also have an important role in the prevention and control of tuberculosis. Certain work settings (health care settings, correctional facilities, and other high-risk congregate housing settings) may pose a higher risk of tuberculosis exposure, and employers often have an important role in preventing tuberculosis exposure among employees and performing medical surveillance of employees for exposure.</p>
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
<p>Clinicians seeking guidance on tuberculosis management among persons living with HIV can obtain additional information from the National Institutes of Health.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation18"">18</a>&nbsp;Clinicians seeking information on medical surveillance of contacts of persons with active tuberculosis can contact their local health department, review their local public health law, or review guidance from the CDC.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation19"">19</a>&nbsp;The CDC also provides information for public health tuberculosis programs.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation20"">20</a>Clinicians seeking information on medical surveillance of health care workers or employees working in high-risk settings can consult resources from the CDC and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation21"">21-23</a>&nbsp;Clinicians seeking guidance on screening for LTBI in children can find more information on the American Academy of Pediatrics&rsquo; Bright Futures website.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation24"">24</a>&nbsp;Clinicians seeking guidance on tuberculosis and pregnancy can obtain information from the CDC.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation25"">25</a></p>",,172,"<p></p>
<h3>Other Considerations</h3>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Screening with the TST requires that patients return 48 to 72 hours after administration of the skin test for interpretation of results. When placing a TST, clinicians should plan with patients accordingly to ensure they can return in time and that the facility is able to interpret the test results within the proper time frame.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation26"">26</a> Screening with an IGRA requires obtaining a single venous blood sample, and patients do not need to return for interpretation of results. However, clinicians should be aware of processing requirements for blood samples and ensure that venous blood samples are drawn and can reach the laboratory for processing within the appropriate time frame (8 to 30 hours, depending on the test).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation27"">27</a></p>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
<p>Further research is needed that evaluates risk assessment tools to determine efficient ways of identifying candidates for LTBI testing and treatment. Additional research on how often LTBI screening should be performed in different subpopulations is also needed. The USPSTF identified no studies on LTBI screening or treatment in pregnant women and the potential effects on the fetus; this represents an important gap in the literature that needs further research. In addition, more studies are needed to clarify whether certain screening methods are preferable for certain risk groups.</p>
<h3>Update of USPSTF Recommendations</h3>
<p>The USPSTF last issued a recommendation on screening for tuberculosis in 1996. At that time, the USPSTF recommended screening for tuberculosis infection with the TST in asymptomatic, high-risk persons (A recommendation) and consideration of bacille Calmette&ndash;Gu&eacute;rin vaccination for selected high-risk individuals only (B recommendation). Given the changes in the epidemiology of the disease, the development of newer screening technologies, and newer methods for developing evidence-based recommendations, the USPSTF decided to update the topic and issue a recommendation using its current methodology and considering all of the available evidence, including studies published prior to 1996.</p>
<h3>Recommendations of Others</h3>
<p>The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends screening for LTBI in populations at increased risk.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation34"">34</a> In 2005, the CDC, the American Thoracic Society, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America issued joint guidelines recommending that clinicians screen for LTBI only among high-risk populations and when treatment is feasible.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation35"">35</a> In its 2013 ""Guide for Primary Health Care Providers,"" the CDC recommended targeted testing for tuberculosis among high-risk populations only.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation8"">8</a> The CDC identifies persons at risk for developing tuberculosis as those who have an increased likelihood of exposure to persons with tuberculosis disease (known close contacts of a person with infectious tuberculosis disease, persons who have immigrated from tuberculosis-endemic regions of the world, and persons who work or reside in facilities or institutions with those at high risk for tuberculosis) or persons with clinical conditions or other factors associated with an increased risk of progression from LTBI to tuberculosis disease (HIV infection, injection drug use, radiographic evidence of prior healed tuberculosis, low body weight, or other medical conditions). Further information on targeted testing is available from the CDC.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation36"">36</a>The WHO also recently issued guidelines on the management of LTBI. For high-income countries with an estimated tuberculosis incidence of less than 100 cases per 100,000 persons (such as the United States), the WHO recommends systematic testing for and treatment of LTBI among persons living with HIV, adult and child contacts of persons with pulmonary tuberculosis, patients initiating anti-tumor necrosis factor treatment, patients receiving dialysis, patients preparing for an organ or hematologic transplant, and patients with silicosis. Either an IGRA or the TST should be used. The WHO also recommends considering systematic testing and treatment among prisoners, health care workers, immigrants from high-burden countries, homeless persons, and illicit drug users. Either an IGRA or the TST should be used. It does not recommend systematic testing for LTBI among persons who have diabetes, engage in harmful alcohol use, smoke tobacco, or are underweight, unless they are already included in the above recommendations.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation37"">37</a> Further information is available from the WHO.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation38"">38</a>.</p>","Burden of Disease
Tuberculosis causes a substantial health burden globally. Approximately one-third of the world’s population is infected with tuberculosis; in 2014, 9.6 million persons were estimated to have contracted tuberculosis, and an estimated 1.5 million deaths related to tuberculosis infection occurred worldwide.9 In the United States, 9563 new active cases of tuberculosis were reported in 2015, which corresponds to an incidence rate of 3.0 cases per 100,000 persons.7 In 2013, 555 deaths from tuberculosis were reported in the United States.28 In 2015, half of all tuberculosis cases occurred in 4 states: California, Texas, New York, and Florida. Asians represented the largest percentage of total cases (33%), followed by Hispanics (28%), African Americans (21%), and whites (13%); American Indian or Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders each represented approximately 1% of cases.7 Incidence rates of active tuberculosis may be higher in populations at increased risk, owing to greater likelihood of exposure (eg, persons who have lived in countries with a high tuberculosis burden) or greater likelihood of progression from LTBI to active disease (eg, persons who are immunosuppressed). Although LTBI is asymptomatic, signs and symptoms of active tuberculosis disease may include cough, hemoptysis (coughing up blood), unexplained weight loss, night sweats, fever, chills, and fatigue.
Scope of Review
The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review of the evidence on screening for LTBI.2, 3 Evidence dating from the inception of searched databases until August 3, 2015, was included. The review focused on evidence on screening for LTBI in asymptomatic adults seen in primary care settings. It did not include evidence on screening in persons for whom LTBI screening would be considered management of a specific condition (eg, persons living with HIV), public health surveillance (ie, tracing contacts of persons with active tuberculosis disease), surveillance of employees working in high-risk settings, or screening indicated prior to the use of specific immunosuppressive medications.
Accuracy of Screening Tests
There is no direct test for the diagnosis of latent infection with M tuberculosis. Following screening, diagnosis of LTBI is based on medical history, physical examination, and exclusion of active tuberculosis disease. In the absence of a reference standard for detection of LTBI, screening test performance is based on detection of disease in persons with known active tuberculosis and nondetection of disease in populations at low risk for the disease and presumed not to have LTBI or active tuberculosis.
The USPSTF identified 67 good- or fair-quality studies that provided information on the accuracy and reliability of screening tests for LTBI.2 For studies reporting on sensitivity, 8 were conducted in countries with a high burden of tuberculosis, 29 were conducted in countries with an intermediate burden, 10 were conducted in countries with a low burden, and 3 were conducted in countries with a mix of low to intermediate burden. For studies reporting on specificity, 3 were conducted in countries with an intermediate burden; 14 were conducted in countries with a low burden; and 1 was conducted in 2 countries: 1 with an intermediate burden and 1 with a low burden.
When using a positive threshold of 10 mm of induration, the TST has moderate sensitivity and high specificity for detection of LTBI. Based on pooled analyses of studies reviewed by the USPSTF, when using a positive threshold of 10 mm, the TST has sensitivity of 79% (11 studies; n=988) and specificity of 97% (9 studies; n=9651).2
Pooled analyses of the T-SPOT.TB test (a type of IGRA) indicate sensitivity of 90% (16 studies; n=984) and specificity of 95% (5 studies; n=1810). Pooled analyses of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test (another type of IGRA) indicate sensitivity of 80% (24 studies; n=2321) and specificity of 97% (4 studies; n=2053). The USPSTF identified no studies that evaluated the accuracy and reliability of sequential screening strategies.
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment
The USPSTF identified no randomized clinical trials that compared screening with no screening to provide direct evidence of the benefit of screening for LTBI on health outcomes, such as rates of active tuberculosis disease, disease-specific or all-cause mortality, or tuberculosis transmission. Three good- or fair-quality trials (n=35,563) conducted in Canada, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia provided evidence on the benefits of treatment of LTBI.2 Trials evaluated treatment with isoniazid,29 rifampin,30 and rifapentine plus isoniazid.31
The best evidence on the effectiveness of treatment was from the International Union Against Tuberculosis (IUAT) trial. This good-quality randomized clinical trial was conducted in 7 European countries (Czechoslovakia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia) among participants with fibrotic pulmonary lesions but not active tuberculosis. The trial, published in 1982, included 27,830 participants and evaluated treatment with daily isoniazid. It found that at 5 years, the relative risk (RR) of progression to active tuberculosis was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.24 to 0.52) for treatment with isoniazid (300 mg daily for 24 weeks) compared with placebo. The trial reported fewer deaths attributable to tuberculosis among participants receiving treatment with isoniazid (0 vs 3 deaths in the placebo group; RR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.01 to 2.78]), although this difference was not statistically significant.
The other 2 treatment trials compared either rifampin with isoniazid and found zero deaths in either group or rifapentine plus isoniazid with isoniazid alone and found that the combination therapy was noninferior in preventing progression to active tuberculosis. None of the treatment studies reported on transmission rates of tuberculosis.
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
The USPSTF identified no studies that directly reported on the harms of screening. Potential harms include stigma associated with screening and diagnostic workup and treatment of false-positive results. Five good- or fair-quality studies (n=36,043) conducted in the United States, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Spain, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia reported on the harms of treatment.2, 29-33 Interventions evaluated included isoniazid, rifampin, and rifapentine plus isoniazid. The most consistently reported harm was hepatotoxicity. The only study that assessed harms of treatment vs placebo was the IUAT trial,30 which found an RR of 4.59 (95% CI, 2.03 to 10.39) for hepatotoxicity at 5 years among participants being treated with isoniazid (300 mg for 24 weeks) vs placebo. The IUAT trial also reported more deaths from hepatotoxicity among participants being treated with isoniazid than with placebo, although this finding was not statistically significant (0.14 vs 0 deaths per 1000 persons; RR calculated from published data, 2.35 [95% CI, 0.12 to 45.46]).
The other trials compared either rifampin30, 32, 33 or rifapentine plus isoniazid31 with isoniazid. Meta-analysis of 3 trials of rifampin compared with isoniazid found a higher RR for hepatoxicity among participants being treated with isoniazid (RR, 3.29 [95% CI, 1.72 to 6.28]).2 None of these trials, which were more recent than the IUAT trial, reported any deaths from hepatotoxicity. The 1 study that reported on hepatotoxicity of rifapentine plus isoniazid vs isoniazid alone found a nonsignificant reduced RR of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.75 to 1.08) for grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity among participants being treated with rifapentine plus isoniazid. There also was a nonsignificant reduced RR of death from hepatotoxicity among participants being treated with rifapentine plus isoniazid versus isoniazid alone (RR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.51 to 1.35]).
A few studies also reported on gastrointestinal adverse events. Compared with placebo, participants treated with isoniazid had a higher risk of medication discontinuation because of gastrointestinal adverse events (RR, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.75]).29 Compared with rifampin, treatment with isoniazid had a nonsignificant increased RR of gastrointestinal adverse events (RR, 1.60 [95% CI, 0.76 to 3.40]) in 2 studies.2 All 5 studies also reported on discontinuation of treatment because of adverse events. Compared with placebo, treatment with isoniazid had an RR of medication discontinuation of 1.50 (95% CI, 1.18 to 1.89).29 Pooling results from the 3 studies of isoniazid vs rifampin found a nonsignificant increased risk of discontinuation with isoniazid (RR, 1.61 [95% CI, 0.57 to 4.57]).2 The study of rifapentine plus isoniazid vs isoniazid alone found an increased risk of discontinuation with rifapentine plus isoniazid (RR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.03 to 1.59]).31
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
Overall, the USPSTF found adequate evidence that accurate screening tests for LTBI are available, treatment of LTBI provides a moderate health benefit in preventing progression to active disease, and the harms of screening and treatment are small. The USPSTF has moderate certainty that screening for LTBI in persons at increased risk for infection provides a moderate net benefit. The USPSTF estimated that if a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 asymptomatic adults at increased risk for tuberculosis (eg, persons born in, or former residents of, high-prevalence countries) were screened, 52 to 146 active tuberculosis cases would be prevented, 7 to 67 cases of hepatotoxicity would occur (depending on type of treatment), and 111 persons would discontinue treatment because of adverse events. The number needed to treat to prevent 1 case of LTBI from progressing to active tuberculosis would range from 111 to 314 (depending on the patient’s risk for progression), and the number needed to harm to cause 1 case of hepatotoxicity from treatment would range from 279 to 2531 (depending on type of treatment). These estimates are based on prevalence data from the 2011–2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey1 and numerous assumptions about screening sensitivity and specificity (eg, using the TST with a 10-mm threshold for a positive diagnosis) and potential benefits of treatment (eg, estimated efficacy of treatment for 24 weeks of isoniazid, based on IUAT trial findings). Further information on the assumptions used is available in the corresponding evidence review.2
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
Tuberculosis disease is caused by M tuberculosis, which is spread through airborne transmission when a person with active pulmonary tuberculosis coughs or sneezes. When the tuberculosis bacillus is inhaled, a person can either clear M tuberculosis; develop active disease (primary tuberculosis disease), which may be infectious; or develop latent infection (LTBI), which is asymptomatic and not infectious. Latent infection can later reactivate and progress to active tuberculosis disease. Approximately 30% of persons exposed to active M tuberculosis will develop LTBI.2 Approximately 5% to 10% of persons with a positive TST result will experience reactivation of LTBI and progress to active tuberculosis disease.2-6
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from March 8 to April 4, 2016. Many comments sought clarification around risk assessment of populations who should receive screening. The USPSTF clarified that given regional variations in the local populations considered at risk for tuberculosis, clinicians may consult their local or state public health agency for additional details on specific populations at risk in their community. Furthermore, the USPSTF clarified that although persons with diabetes and pregnant women are not addressed separately in this recommendation statement, they are also not excluded from the recommendation. A few public comments sought clarification on the recommended frequency of screening. Although the USPSTF sought evidence on screening frequency, there was not enough evidence available to determine an optimal screening interval. Several comments requested that the recommendation include treatment of LTBI. While the USPSTF acknowledges that treatment of LTBI contributes to the success of LTBI screening, it is beyond the scope of the USPSTF to make any specific recommendations on treatment. The CDC provides treatment guidelines for LTBI.17","<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>In the United States, tuberculosis remains an important preventable disease, including active tuberculosis, which may be infectious, and latent infection (LTBI), which is asymptomatic and not infectious but can later reactivate and progress to active disease. The precise prevalence rate of LTBI in the United States is difficult to determine; however, based on 2011&ndash;2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data, estimated prevalence is 4.7% to 5.0%.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation1"">1</a> Tuberculosis is spread through respiratory transmission. Approximately 30% of persons exposed to <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </em>will develop LTBI and, if untreated, approximately 5% to 10% of these persons will progress to active tuberculosis disease or reactivation of tuberculosis.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation2"">2-6</a> Rates of progression may be higher in persons with certain risk factors or medical conditions. An effective strategy for reducing the transmission, morbidity, and mortality of active tuberculosis disease is the identification and treatment of LTBI to prevent its progression to active disease. Traditionally, prevention of tuberculosis has relied on public health systems; however, more recently, screening for LTBI has become a relevant primary care issue.</p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that accurate screening tests are available to detect LTBI. Screening tests include the Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs); both are moderately sensitive and highly specific.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment<strong> </strong></h3>
<p>The USPSTF found no studies that evaluated the direct benefits of screening for LTBI. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that treatment of LTBI with regimens recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) decreases progression to active tuberculosis; the magnitude of this benefit is moderate.</p>
<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found no direct evidence on the harms of screening for LTBI. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the magnitude of harms of treatment of LTBI with CDC-recommended regimens is small. The primary harm of treatment is hepatotoxicity.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of screening for LTBI in persons at increased risk for tuberculosis is moderate. </p>",Screening for Latent Tuberculosis Infection,"Latent Tuberculosis Infection, Screening, 2016"
"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults 65 years or older who do not present to their primary care clinician with vision problems.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
In 2011, about 12% of US adults aged 65 to 74 years and 15% of those 75 years or older reported having problems seeing, even with glasses or contact lenses.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation1"">1</a> The prevalence of AMD is 6.5% in adults older than 40 years and increases with age (2.8% in those aged 40&ndash;59 years and 13.4% in those aged &ge;60 years).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation2"">2</a> About half of all cases of bilateral low vision (ie, best-corrected visual acuity of &lt;20/40) in adults 40 years and older are caused by cataracts. The prevalence of cataracts increases sharply with age; an estimated 50% of US adults 80 years or older have cataracts.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation1"">1</a> The prevalence of hyperopia requiring a correction of +3.0 diopters or more ranges from about 5.9% in US adults aged 50 to 54 years, to 15.2% in adults aged 65 to 69 years, to 20.4% in adults 80 years or older.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation1"">1<br /><br /></a>Older age is an important risk factor for most types of visual impairment. Additional risk factors for cataracts are smoking, alcohol use, ultraviolet light exposure, diabetes, corticosteroid use, and black race. Risk factors for AMD include smoking, family history, and white race.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation1"">1</a>
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
The harms of screening in a primary care setting have not been adequately studied. Overall, the potential for harms from treatment are small to none. Harms of treatment of refractive error include a potential for increased falls with the use of multifocal lenses; infectious keratitis with the use of contact lenses, laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), or laser-assisted subepithelial keratectomy (LASEK); and corneal ectasia with LASIK. Harms of cataract surgery include posterior lens opacification and endophthalmitis. Treatment of AMD with antioxidant vitamins and mineral supplements is not associated with increased risk of most serious adverse events.<br /><br />Although there appears to be benefit in longer-term outcomes, a systematic review found that treatment of AMD with laser photocoagulation was associated with greater risk of acute loss of 6 or more lines of visual acuity vs no treatment at 3 months (relative risk [RR], 1.41 [95% CI, 1.08&ndash;1.82]).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation3"">3</a> Pooled estimates report a non&ndash;statistically significant association bewteen photodynamic therapy and risk of acute loss of 20 or more letters of visual acuity vs placebo at 7 days (RR, 3.75 [95% CI, 0.87&ndash;16]) (3 trials).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation4"">4</a>, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation5"">5</a> One of 2 trials found that treatment of wet AMD with intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor therapy was associated with greater likelihood of withdrawal vs sham therapy; there were no differences in serious or other adverse events, but estimates were imprecise.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation1"">1</a>, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation4"">4</a>, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation6"">6</a>, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation7"">7</a>
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
About half of US adults older than 65 years reported having an eye examination within the last 12 months in a 2007 study.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation8"">8</a>
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
A visual acuity test (eg, the Snellen eye chart) is the usual method for screening for visual acuity impairment in the primary care setting. Screening questions are not as accurate as visual acuity testing for identifying visual acuity impairment. Evidence on the use of other tests for vision screening in primary care, such as the pinhole test (a test for refractive error), the Amsler grid (a test of central vision to detect AMD), genetic testing, or funduscopy (visual inspection of the interior of the eye), is lacking.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
Several types of treatment are effective for improving visual acuity. Corrective lenses improve visual acuity in patients with a refractive error. Treatment of cataracts through surgical removal of the cataract is effective for improving visual acuity. Treatment of exudative (or wet) AMD includes laser photocoagulation, verteporfin, and intravitreal injections of VEGF inhibitors. Antioxidant vitamins and minerals are an effective treatment for dry AMD.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
This recommendation statement does not include screening for glaucoma. The USPSTF&rsquo;s recommendations on screening for glaucoma and falls prevention are available on its website (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).",,165,"The American Optometric Association recommends that asymptomatic adults 61 years and older receive an eye examination every year.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation28"">28</a> The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends a comprehensive eye examination that includes visual acuity testing and dilation every 1 to 2 years for all adults 65 years or older who do not have risk factors or more frequently if risk factors are present.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation29"">29</a> This recommendation is based on descriptive studies, case reports, and expert consensus.

Vision impairment is common in older adults. Older adults have a higher prevalence of primary ocular disease and systemic diseases associated with ocular disease than younger adults; in addition, older adults also have normal age-related changes in vision (ie, presbyopia). In 2011, an estimated 12% of US adults aged 65 to 74 years and 15% of those 75 years or older reported vision loss.1
Refractive error, AMD, and cataracts are common causes of vision impairment in older adults. Severe refractive error (requiring correction of ≥+3.0 diopters) affects an estimated 6% of US adults aged 50 to 54 years, 15% of adults aged 65 to 69 years, and 20% of adults 80 years or older.1 About 60% of all cases of refractive error are deemed correctable to better than 20/40 visual acuity.9 In the United States, more than 15 million adults older than 65 years have cataracts, and it is the most common cause of blindness in black adults older than 40 years. Age-related macular degeneration affects 1.5 million older adults in the United States and is the most common cause of blindness in white adults.2, 10
Scope of Review
In 2009, the USPSTF issued an I statement on screening for impaired visual acuity in older adults. To update this I statement, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to focus on evidence published since its last review. The USPSTF reviewed evidence on screening for visual acuity impairment associated with uncorrected refractive error, cataracts, and AMD in adults 65 years or older in the primary care setting. The USPSTF also reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening, the accuracy of screening, and the benefits and harms of treatment of early vision impairment due to uncorrected refractive error, cataracts, and AMD.
Accuracy of Screening Tests
Asking screening questions to elicit self-perceived problems with vision has been studied as a screening method. However, compared with a standard eye chart, screening questions are not accurate for identifying persons with vision impairment.1, 4
In the United States, a standardized visual acuity test is the usual method for identifying the presence of vision impairment. Visual acuity tests assess the patient’s ability to recognize letters of different sizes arranged in rows from a prespecified distance (typically 20 feet). Standardized visual acuity tests are good at identifying refractive error.
Compared with a detailed ophthalmological examination, no visual acuity screening test has both high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of any underlying visual condition (eg, AMD or cataracts). Few studies have focused on the accuracy of the Amsler grid, clinical examination, pinhole test, or fundus examination in the primary care setting. One study on the Amsler grid reported poor accuracy for detecting any visual condition compared with ophthalmological examination, and 1 study reported that geriatricians correctly identified most patients with cataracts and AMD through a clinical examination.1, 4
Two studies from 2012 evaluated the accuracy of the Computer Vision Screen and its flip-chart version compared with a “gold standard” eye examination that included detailed history, symptoms, and a comprehensive eye examination. These studies reported moderate sensitivity (0.75 to 0.80) and specificity (0.68 to 0.77).11 A third study from 2009 evaluated the accuracy of the Minimum Data Set 2.0 Vision Patterns section compared with a standard visual acuity test. The study reported poor accuracy, depending on the cutoff score; sensitivity ranged from 0.11 to 0.52 and specificity ranged from 0.25 to 0.96.12 These studies had methodological limitations, including uncertainty as to whether the reference standard was interpreted independently from the screening test and the lack of a predefined threshold to determine a positive result.
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment
There is limited direct evidence on the effectiveness of screening for visual impairment in the primary care setting. Three fair-quality cluster randomized clinical trials (RCTs) found no difference in vision and other clinical or functional outcomes between vision screening (as part of a multicomponent screening) with visual acuity testing or questions compared with usual care, no vision screening, or delayed screening.13-15 The application of this evidence to screening in a primary care setting has limitations. Issues with the study methods include failure to report allocation concealment, lack of intention-to-treat analysis, and unclear blinding of outcome assessors. Other limitations relevant to the primary care setting include that the recommended interventions are provided by eye care specialists and that many patients do not get the recommended glasses.
Consistent evidence shows that most older adults with a refractive error can achieve visual acuity better than 20/40 with refractive correction. Evidence from a few trials indicates that immediate correction of refractive error with eyeglasses in older adults is associated with improved short-term vision-related quality of life or function compared with delayed treatment. A 2005 systematic review of 179 RCTs and observational studies found that refractive surgery was highly effective at improving refractive error; 92% to 94% of persons with myopia and 86% to 96% of persons with hyperopia achieved visual acuity of 20/40 or better. However, most of these studies were done in younger adults, limiting its generalizability to older adults.16
Cataract surgery is consistently associated with improved visual acuity in observational studies. About 90% of patients have postoperative visual acuity better than 20/40.1, 4, 17 The effects of cataract surgery on vision-related quality of life and function are mixed. One trial reported a decreased risk of falls after immediate vs delayed cataract surgery (RR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.40–0.96]).18 Another trial reported no effect on falls or fracture risk.19 Some studies showed improvements in measures of function and quality of life associated with cataract surgery, while others reported no effect on these measures. Evidence from observational studies on the effects of treatment on motor vehicle accidents and death is sparse and inconclusive. No randomized trials were identified that evaluated clinical outcomes associated with cataract surgery vs no surgery.
A systematic review from 2006 reported that antioxidants were effective for slowing the progression of dry AMD; its conclusions were primarily based on 1 large good-quality trial (the Age-Related Eye Disease Study).20 It found that taking an antioxidant multivitamin (composed of vitamins C and E and beta-carotene with zinc) was associated with reduced likelihood of progression to advanced AMD (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.68); however, the between-group differences in the likelihood of losing measurable visual acuity did not reach statistical significance. A 10-year follow-up study of the Age-Related Eye Disease Study published in 2009 reported similar results; an antioxidant multivitamin with zinc was associated with reduced likelihood of progression of AMD (OR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.53 to 0.83]). The likelihood of losing measurable visual acuity did reach statistical significance in this follow-up study (OR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.57 to 0.88]).21
For wet AMD, laser photocoagulation is superior to no treatment in slowing the progression of vision loss (≥6 lines of visual acuity) after 2 years (RR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.53 to 0.83]), although these studies had important limitations.3 Two good-quality systematic reviews of photodynamic therapy found verteporfin, a photoreactive agent, to be superior to placebo in preventing loss of visual acuity associated with wet AMD; quality-of-life outcomes were not reported.5, 22 Injection of VEGF inhibitors (eg, pegaptanib and ranibizumab) to suppress growth of abnormal blood vessels associated with wet AMD was effective in reducing risk of visual acuity loss (<15 letters of visual acuity) (RR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.22 to 1.75]).4, 23 Evidence on vision-related functional outcomes is limited; 1 trial reported small improvements in vision-related functional scores in the treatment group, and 1 trial reported a higher likelihood of driving in the treatment group.1
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
No studies are available on the harms of screening in a primary care setting. Several studies evaluated the harms of treatment of refractive error, cataracts, and AMD. Most of these studies are older and were reviewed for the 2009 USPSTF recommendation. Data on harms of treatment of refractive error in older adults are limited. A small observational study reported an association between multifocal lens use and increased risk of falls in older adults.24 Serious harms, including vision loss, are rare as a result of contact lens use or refractive surgery. Corneal ectasia, a thinning and bulging of the cornea, is a known harm of refractive surgery and occurs at a median rate of 0.2%.1, 4 Cataract surgery can lead to posterior capsule opacification of the implanted lens, requiring further procedures; reported rates of this complication vary widely from 0.7% to 48%.17, 25 A systematic review from 1998 reported an incidence of 28% at 5 years.26 Endophthalmitis, bullous keratopathy, dislocation of intraocular lens, macular edema, and retinal detachment are other complications associated with cataract surgery.
Pooled data on the harms of treatment of AMD from trials of antioxidant vitamins and minerals reported no association with withdrawal due to gastrointestinal symptoms.1, 4 The largest trial reported an increased risk of hospitalization due to genitourinary causes with zinc and an increased risk of yellowing skin with antioxidants; it found no association with death or lung cancer.1, 4 Two trials on the treatment of early AMD reported no association between supplement use and any adverse event, serious adverse events, serious ocular events, or withdrawal due to adverse events.1
Treatment of wet AMD with laser photocoagulation is associated with increased risk of acute visual acuity loss at 3 months after the procedure but, as described earlier, is also associated with reduced risk of visual acuity loss at 2 years.1, 4 Photodynamic therapy with verteporfin carries an initial risk of acute visual acuity loss and greater risk of back pain related to the infusion.5 Other reported harms of photodynamic therapy include visual disturbance, injection site reactions, and photosensitivity. Potential harms associated with intravitreal injections of VEGF inhibitors include endophthalmitis, uveitis, increased intraocular pressure, traumatic lens injury, and retinal detachment.1, 4 In 3 trials, these outcomes were infrequent, and differences between the intervention and sham therapy groups were not statistically significant; however, estimates were imprecise, with wide CIs given the rarity of these outcomes.1, 6, 7, 27
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The limited direct evidence from 3 fair-quality cluster RCTs show no difference in vision and other clinical or functional outcomes between vision screening and usual care, no vision screening, or delayed screening.
Although visual acuity testing is adequate for identifying refractive error, it is inadequate for identifying early AMD or early cataracts in a primary care setting. Effective treatments are available for uncorrected refractive error, cataracts, and AMD. The overall harms are small; however, many of the treatments carry a small risk of serious complications, including acute visual loss. Although treatments that entail little harm can correct impaired visual acuity, limited evidence is available on the effect of screening and treatment on quality of life and overall and vision-related function, especially in older adults with screen-detected visual problems.
The limitations of the direct evidence and the inadequacy of the evidence on key pieces of indirect evidence prevent the USPSTF from developing a coherent assessment of the overall net benefit; therefore, the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from July 21 through August 17, 2015. The USPSTF received very few comments on the draft recommendation statement. One respondent requested that the USPSTF clarify that an I statement is not a recommendation against screening; the USPSTF plans to reinforce when communicating this recommendation statement that an I statement is not a recommendation for or against screening.","<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Impairment of visual acuity is a serious public health problem in older adults. In 2011, about 12% of US adults aged 65 to 74 years and 15% of those 75 years or older reported having problems seeing, even with glasses or contact lenses.</p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening with a visual acuity test can identify persons with a refractive error. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening questions are not as accurate as visual acuity testing for assessing visual acuity. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that visual acuity testing alone does not accurately identify early age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or cataracts.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate overall evidence on the benefits of screening, early detection, and treatment to provide a coherent assessment of the overall benefits. Several studies evaluated the direct benefit of screening and reported no reductions in vision disorders or vision-related function in screened populations; however, these studies had limitations, including differing control interventions, high loss to follow-up, and low uptake of treatment. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that early treatment of refractive error, cataracts, and AMD improves or prevents loss of visual acuity.</p>
<h3>Harms of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that early treatment of refractive error, cataracts, and AMD may lead to harms that are small to none.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for impaired visual acuity in older adults. The evidence is lacking to provide a coherent assessment, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.</p>",Screening for Impaired Visual Acuity in Older Adults,"Impaired Visual Acuity in Older Adults, Screening, 2016"
"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults who do not have a history of premalignant or malignant skin lesions. Patients who present with a suspicious skin lesion or who are already under surveillance because of a high risk of skin cancer, such as those with a familial syndrome (eg, familial atypical mole and melanoma syndrome), are outside the scope of this recommendation statement.</p>
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
<p>Skin cancer of any type occurs more commonly in men than in women and among persons with a fair complexion, persons who use indoor tanning beds, and persons with a history of sunburns or previous skin cancer. Specific risk factors for melanoma include having a dysplastic nevus (atypical mole), having multiple (ie, &ge;100) nevi, and having a family history of melanoma.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation3"">3</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation4"">4</a>&nbsp;Like most types of cancer, the risk of melanoma increases with age; the median age at diagnosis is 63 years, and the median age at death is 69 years.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a></p>
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Benefit of Early Detection and Treatment</h4>
<p>Direct evidence to assess the effect of screening with a clinical visual skin examination on the risk of death from skin cancer is limited.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation3"">3</a>&nbsp;A single ecologic study (Skin Cancer Research to Provide Evidence for Effectiveness of Screening in Northern Germany [SCREEN]) with important methodological limitations suggests that a 1-time, general population-based screening program (with limited participation of 19%) combined with a disease awareness campaign may result in, at most, 1 fewer death due to melanoma per 100,000 persons over a decade.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation5"">5</a>&nbsp;An independent analysis of the SCREEN population found that the observed melanoma mortality rate returned to preintervention levels after 5 years of follow-up (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#fig"">Figure</a>).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation6"">6</a></p>
<h4>Potential Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h4>
<p>Information on the harms of screening is also sparse.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation3"">3</a>&nbsp;The majority of suspicious skin lesions excised during screening are not cancerous; for example, the SCREEN study found that between 20 and 55 excisions were performed to detect 1 case of melanoma, depending on patient age.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation7"">7</a>&nbsp;The SCREEN study did not report the number of excisions required to prevent 1 death from melanoma, but it can be estimated at more than 4,000. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment&mdash;the diagnosis and treatment of cancer that would never have harmed the patient in the absence of screening&mdash;are other important potential harms. Ecologic evidence suggests that screening with a visual skin examination results in the overdiagnosis of skin cancer;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation8"">8</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation9"">9</a>&nbsp;however, current evidence is insufficient to be reliably certain of the magnitude of this effect.</p>
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
<p>Contemporary data on clinician practice patterns related to skin cancer screening are limited. A 2005 survey of US physicians found that 81% of dermatologists, 60% of primary care physicians, and 56% of internists reported performing a full-body visual skin cancer screening examination on their adult patients.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation10"">10</a></p>
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
<p>The clinical visual skin examination assesses skin lesions using the &ldquo;ABCDE rule,&rdquo; which involves looking for the following characteristics: asymmetry, border irregularity, nonuniform color, diameter greater than 6 mm, and evolving over time.</p>
<h3>Screening Interval</h3>
<p>The optimal interval for visual skin examination by a clinician to screen for skin cancer, if it exists, is unknown.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Treatment of screen-detected melanoma generally involves excision, with or without lymph node management, depending on the stage at diagnosis. There are a variety of treatments available for squamous and basal cell carcinoma (which have excellent cure rates), including surgical excision, Mohs micrographic surgery, radiation therapy, curettage and electrodessication, and cryosurgery, among other options.</p>
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
<p>The USPSTF recommends that children, adolescents, and young adults aged 10 to 24 years who have fair skin be counseled about minimizing their exposure to ultraviolet radiation to reduce their risk of developing skin cancer.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation11"">11</a></p>
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force has made a number of recommendations related to preventing skin cancer through the use of interventions that target child care centers; outdoor occupational, recreational, and tourism settings; primary and middle schools; and communities (available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.thecommunityguide.org/cancer/index.html"" target=""_blank"">www.thecommunityguide.org/cancer/index.html</a><a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/exit-disclaimer"" title=""This link goes offsite.

<p>The USPSTF recognizes the challenge of conducting a definitive randomized clinical trial (RCT) on primary screening, with cause-specific mortality as an end point, to provide clear evidence on the efficacy of the clinical visual skin examination in screening for skin cancer, given the comparatively low rate of death from melanoma in the population (even among persons at higher risk). If adequately powered RCTs are not possible, a&nbsp;high-quality case-control study could provide sufficient power without requiring a large sample size. However,&nbsp;this study design has limitations in the ability to create an appropriate comparison group, the ability to accurately measure the exposure of interest (because of recall bias and other sources of misclassification), healthy volunteer bias (persons receiving skin examinations likely have other good health habits), and other unmeasured sources of confounding. Studies would have to be carefully designed to avoid these threats to validity. Despite these challenges, the USPSTF concludes that further evidence is necessary to advance the field on this essential question. An optimized version of the SCREEN study (ie, a time-series study), in which the clinical visual skin examination alone, without the potential confounding of a second intervention, is evaluated, would also be useful. Additional research on the possible harms of screening for skin cancer&mdash;particularly the potential for overdiagnosis and overtreatment&mdash;is also needed to help fully understand the ultimate net benefit of the clinical visual skin examination.</p>
<h3>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendations</h3>
<p>This recommendation updates the 2009 USPSTF recommendation.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation18"">18</a>&nbsp;The USPSTF has again concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefit and harms of screening for skin cancer in adults with a clinical visual skin examination. However, the USPSTF decided to no longer include a statement about patient skin self-examination in the current recommendation. This intervention will be addressed in the USPSTF&rsquo;s update of its recommendation statement on counseling to prevent skin cancer.</p>
<h3>Recommendations of Others</h3>
<p>Most professional organizations in the United States have no specific recommendations about screening for skin cancer with the clinical visual skin examination. The American College of Physicians has no current guidance on skin cancer screening performed by a clinician, nor does the American College of Preventive Medicine (the latter has an archived statement from 1998<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation19"">19</a>). The American Academy of Family Physicians concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefit and harms of visual skin cancer screening in adults.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation20"">20</a>&nbsp;The American Academy of Dermatology does not have formal guidelines on skin cancer screening, although it does encourage and provide resources for its physician members to hold free skin cancer screening events for the public.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation21"">21</a>&nbsp;The American Cancer Society recommends that adults 20 years and older who receive periodic health examinations should have their skin examined as part of a general cancer-related checkup.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation22"">22</a></p>","Scope of Review
The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review,3, 4 to update its 2009 recommendation on screening for skin cancer. The review addressed several questions about screening for skin cancer with the clinical visual skin examination, including its effectiveness in reducing skin cancer morbidity and mortality and death from any cause; its potential harms, including any harms resulting from associated diagnostic follow-up; its test characteristics when performed by a primary care clinician versus a dermatologist; and whether its use leads to earlier detection of skin cancer compared with usual care.3 Unlike in the previous review, the evidence concerning patient self-examination for skin cancer was not included in this statement. The visual skin self-examination will be addressed in a separate recommendation statement on counseling to prevent skin cancer.
Accuracy of Screening Tests
A systematic review of 11 studies on the diagnostic accuracy of screening by primary care clinicians and dermatologists identified during the previous evidence review found that screening by primary care clinicians had a sensitivity of 42% to 100% and a specificity of 98% for the diagnosis of melanoma.12 Since then, 2 additional studies on the test characteristics of the clinical visual skin examination have been published: 1 evaluating screening performed by primary care clinicians and 1 evaluating screening performed by dermatologists or plastic surgeons. These studies found that sensitivity ranged from 40% to 70%, which sharply decreased as the length of follow-up increased (from 12 to 24 or 36 months). Specificity ranged from 86% to 98%.3, 13, 14 None of the studies could draw reliable conclusions as to whether screening performed by any of the clinical specialties differed in diagnostic accuracy.3, 12-14
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment
No RCT has directly evaluated the effectiveness of the clinical visual skin examination for reducing skin cancer morbidity or mortality (a pilot study by Aitken et al in Queensland, Australia, began in 2002, but a full trial was never completed).3 A single fair-quality ecologic study (SCREEN) compared trends in melanoma mortality rates in 1 region of Germany using a population-based skin cancer awareness campaign, clinician education and training, and clinical visual skin examination provided through a cancer screening program with several surrounding regions that did not have similar interventions available. After a 2-year public skin cancer awareness campaign, 360,288 adults 20 years and older (about 19% of the eligible population) received a single clinical visual skin examination. After 10 years, the study found a 48% relative reduction in the risk of dying from melanoma in the region that instituted the interventions compared with the control regions, which translates into an absolute reduction of 1 fewer death from melanoma per 100,000 persons screened.15
The SCREEN study has several important limitations. First, it does not provide individual patient-level data on the effect of the clinical visual skin examination, and as an ecologic observational study, it is subject to the potential effects of known and unknown biases and confounders. Second, the separate effects of the public education component cannot be disentangled from those of the clinical visual skin examination component; therefore, it is likely that the effect of screening alone is smaller than estimated. In addition, the melanoma mortality rate in the region receiving the interventions was already declining prior to the introduction of the cancer screening program. This also suggests that the 48% relative reduction overestimates the true effect size of screening. Several other data points raise questions about the plausibility of the observed effect: 1) only 19% of the total eligible population was actually screened, and 37% of these individuals were lost to follow-up, yet the relative magnitude of the mortality reduction in the population is larger than in almost any other cancer screening intervention currently available; and 2) three-fourths of the population screened were women, yet equal reductions in melanoma mortality were observed among both men and women.15 Furthermore, an independent study evaluating an additional 5 years of follow-up in the SCREEN study population found that the observed reduction in melanoma mortality rates did not persist over time but essentially returned to the baseline rates observed before the screening program was initiated (Figure).6
When direct, overarching evidence concerning the benefit of a screening intervention on health outcomes is inconclusive, the USPSTF looks to a chain of indirect evidence to assess the effectiveness of the preventive service. In the case of the clinical visual skin examination, this includes linking together information about the ability of screening to detect melanoma earlier than in usual care and the link between earlier detection of skin cancer and resultant morbidity and mortality. The USPSTF identified only 1 fair-quality case-control study pertaining to the question of whether screening for skin cancer with a clinical visual skin examination leads to the earlier detection of melanoma compared with usual care.3 It found a modest association between the clinical visual skin examination and early detection (odds ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.75 to 0.98]).16 However, because the study used patient self-report to identify exposure to clinician skin examination, recall bias is a potential concern.
Harms of Early Detection and Treatment
Evidence on the harms of the clinical visual skin examination is limited.3 In the SCREEN study, approximately 4.4% of screened individuals (1 of 23 participants) underwent a skin excision for a suspicious lesion. The majority of these biopsies did not result in a cancer diagnosis. Overall, for both men and women, 1 case of melanoma was detected per 28 excisions performed. However, this varied greatly by patient age. For example, among men aged 20 to 34 years versus 65 years and older, 1 case of melanoma was detected per 52 versus 20 skin excisions, respectively.7
Cosmetic or, more rarely, functional adverse effects may also result from an excisional biopsy prompted by clinical visual skin examination, although there are few data available on the frequency or specific details of these events. One fair-quality study of a single physician’s performance of skin cancer screening and razor-blade shave biopsy among patients who were not ultimately diagnosed with skin cancer found that 7% of these patients expressed poor satisfaction with the cosmetic results (whereas the physician felt the results were poor in 16% of cases).3, 17
Overdiagnosis and overtreatment—the identification and treatment of cancer that would never have harmed the patient in the absence of screening—is also a potential outcome of concern. It is not possible to directly determine for any individual patient whether a diagnosed cancer will progress or not; as such, measuring overdiagnosis is not a straightforward process and must be indirectly quantified. In the case of skin cancer, there is limited research to estimate the potential magnitude of the burden of overdiagnosis associated with screening. An ecologic study linking melanoma incidence and mortality data from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program with Medicare claims for skin biopsy among patients 65 years and older found that from 1986 to 2001, the average incidence of melanoma increased 2.4 times (from 45 to 108 cases per 100,000 persons), while the average biopsy rate increased 2.5 times (from 2847 to 7222 biopsies performed per 100,000 persons). However, the increased cancer incidence was entirely due to extra cases of in situ and local disease, without the expected complementary decrease in the incidence of advanced melanoma or death from melanoma. The authors concluded that this pattern strongly suggested that screening efforts in the United States were generating overdiagnosis, rather than depicting a true increase in the occurrence of melanoma.8
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
Evidence to assess the net benefit of screening for skin cancer with the clinical visual skin examination is limited. Direct evidence on the effectiveness of screening in reducing melanoma morbidity and mortality is limited to a single fair-quality ecologic study with important methodological limitations. This study suggests that, at best, a program of public education and disease awareness coupled with 1-time visual skin examination by a clinician may reduce the risk of dying from melanoma among average-risk adults by about 1 death per 100,000 persons screened after 10 years; however, there are reasons to believe that the effect size is likely smaller. The indirect pathway of evidence (ie, examining the accuracy of screening; link between visual skin examination and earlier detection of melanoma, such as lesion thickness; and the link between earlier detection of melanoma and skin cancer–related morbidity and mortality) and the studies included as part of this pathway are subject to several important biases of screening, including lead-time bias and length-biased sampling. These biases preclude the USPSTF’s ability to draw reliable conclusions about the efficacy of the clinical visual skin examination with reasonable certainty. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to reliably conclude whether screening for skin cancer with a clinical visual skin examination reduces melanoma morbidity or mortality.
Information on harms is similarly sparse. The potential for harm clearly exists, including a high rate of unnecessary biopsies, possibly resulting in cosmetic or—more rarely—functional adverse effects, and the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. It is difficult for the USPSTF to accurately bound the magnitude of these potential harms without better information about the frequency with which skin cancer is likely overdiagnosed and overtreated. Further, it is challenging for the USPSTF to correctly bound the magnitude of the net benefit without more accurate and precise information about the size of the potential mortality benefit, if one exists. As such, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefit and harms of screening for skin cancer in adults with a clinical visual skin examination.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from December 1 through December 28, 2015. In response to the comments received, the USPSTF added a reference to a study that examined longer-term melanoma mortality rates in the SCREEN study population.6 The USPSTF also clarified that the recommendation does encompass all forms of skin cancer (ie, squamous and basal cell carcinoma and melanoma). A clinical visual skin examination will detect all skin cancer types; however, in assessing the potential benefit of screening, the USPSTF focused on melanoma because the associated morbidity and mortality rates for this type of skin cancer are substantially greater than for the others. In addition, although the systematic evidence review searched for studies of all skin cancer types, the evidence that met the prespecified inclusion criteria for the review only described efficacy outcomes for melanoma.
Several comments stressed that the USPSTF should place greater emphasis on the benefits of detecting and treating nonmelanoma skin cancer, noting the risk for such cancer to become locally destructive and lead to disfigurement if left untreated. Although the USPSTF agrees that reduced morbidity from nonmelanoma skin cancer or its requisite treatment would be an important benefit of screening, there is currently no evidence available to address this outcome for the clinical visual skin examination. It is therefore unknown whether there is an incremental benefit to detecting nonmelanoma skin cancer through a program of regular visual clinical examination versus patient self-identification as part of general body awareness followed by reasonably prompt evaluation by a clinician.
Several comments suggested that the USPSTF should consider making a separate positive recommendation for persons who are at increased risk for skin cancer (eg, those with a family history of melanoma), as they may potentially benefit more from a screening intervention. At present, there is insufficient evidence for any population that regular visual skin examination by a clinician can reduce skin cancer–related morbidity and mortality; the USPSTF agrees that targeted research among populations with the highest burden of disease would be useful.","<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Skin cancer includes melanoma and basal and squamous cell carcinoma. Basal and squamous cell carcinoma, known together as nonmelanoma skin cancer, are the most common types of cancer in the United States and represent the vast majority of all cases of skin cancer (&gt;98%).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;However, nonmelanoma skin cancer rarely results in death or substantial morbidity (&lt;0.1% of patient deaths are caused by this type of cancer), whereas melanoma skin cancer has notably higher mortality rates.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;For this reason, although a visual skin examination by a clinician will detect all 3 of these cancer types, in understanding the potential benefit of screening, the USPSTF prioritized outcomes related to melanoma in developing this recommendation statement. In 2016, an estimated 76,400 US men and women will develop melanoma and 10,100 will die from the disease.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a></p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>Evidence is adequate that visual skin examination by a clinician has modest sensitivity and specificity for detecting melanoma. Evidence is more limited and inconsistent regarding the accuracy of the clinical visual skin examination for detecting nonmelanoma skin cancer.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation2"">2</a></p>
<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>
<p>Evidence is inadequate to reliably conclude that early detection of skin cancer through visual skin examination by a clinician reduces morbidity or mortality.</p>
<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>
<p>Evidence is adequate that visual skin examination by a clinician to screen for skin cancer leads to harms that are at least small, but current data are insufficient to precisely bound the upper magnitude of these harms. Potential harms of skin cancer screening include misdiagnosis, overdiagnosis, and the resulting cosmetic and&mdash;more rarely&mdash;functional adverse effects resulting from biopsy and overtreatment.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient and that the balance of benefit and harms of visual skin examination by a clinician to screen for skin cancer in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.</p>",Screening for Skin Cancer,"Skin Cancer, Screening, 2016"

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">Pulse palpation and heart auscultation can also detect atrial fibrillation. In the systematic review discussed above, pulse palpation was reported to have relatively good sensitivity (point estimate, 0.87-1.00) but lower specificity than ECG (point estimate, 0.77-0.84) for detecting atrial fibrillation.<sup style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;""><a style=""padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.1em; margin: 0em; color: #0072bc; text-decoration-line: none;"" href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/atrial-fibrillation-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation3"">3</a></sup>&nbsp;However, to address this lower specificity, confirmatory ECG can be readily performed in practice in response to an irregular pulse.</p>

Misinterpretation of ECG results may lead to misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment. Treatment of atrial fibrillation includes anticoagulant therapy for stroke prevention, which is associated with a risk of bleeding, and pharmacologic, surgical, endovascular (eg, ablation), or combined treatments to control heart rhythm or heart rate. In addition, ECG may detect other abnormalities (either true- or false-positive results) that can lead to invasive confirmatory testing and treatments that have the potential for serious harm. For example, angiography and revascularization are associated with risks, including bleeding, contrast-induced nephropathy, and allergic reactions to the contrast agent.</p>

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">Treatment of atrial fibrillation has 2 components&mdash;managing arrhythmia and preventing stroke. In general, these treatment goals are independent of each other, because even restoring sinus rhythm does not necessarily reduce stroke risk enough to change how anticoagulant therapy is managed, given the potential for subsequent recurrence of atrial fibrillation. Arrhythmia can be managed by controlling the heart rate to minimize symptoms (usually through medication) or by restoring a normal rhythm. Methods for restoring normal rhythm include electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion and surgical or catheter ablation. Some evidence suggests that selected patients may be able to reverse atrial fibrillation through lifestyle changes that address the underlying causes of atrial fibrillation.<sup style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;""><a style=""padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.1em; margin: 0em; color: #0072bc; text-decoration-line: none;"" href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/atrial-fibrillation-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation8"">8</a></sup>&nbsp;Stroke risk for persons with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation can be estimated with tools such as CHADS<sub style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;"">2</sub>&nbsp;(congestive heart failure, hypertension, age &ge;75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism [doubled]) (developed by Gage and colleagues, Washington University School of Medicine) or its updated version, CHA<sub style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;"">2</sub>DS<sub style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;"">2</sub>-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age &ge;75 years [doubled], diabetes, stroke/transient ischemic attack/thromboembolism [doubled], vascular disease [prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque], age 65-74 years, sex category [female]) (Lip and colleagues, University of Birmingham Centre for Cardiovascular Sciences).

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">The connection between atrial fibrillation and stroke is well established, as is the existence of undiagnosed atrial fibrillation, especially among older adults. Randomized trials enrolling asymptomatic persons that directly compare screening with usual care and that assess both health outcomes and harms are needed to understand the balance of benefits and harms of screening for atrial fibrillation. Other research needs include understanding how to best optimize the accuracy of ECG interpretation. Although the evidence review for this recommendation statement focused on screening with ECG, the effectiveness of newer technologies capable of assessing pulse and heart rhythm as potential screening strategies should be evaluated. In addition, as ECG and other technologies (eg, AliveCOR Kardia system [AliveCor Inc], discussed in the context of the REHEARSE-AF trial below) are used to record heart activity for longer periods and thus are able to detect shorter episodes of arrhythmia, understanding the stroke risk associated with brief episodes of subclinical atrial fibrillation, and the potential benefit of anticoagulation therapy if risk is significant, is another important research need.</p>

"<p><strong>Patient Population Under Consideration</strong>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic children and adolescents 20 years or younger without a known diagnosis of a lipid disorder.&nbsp;<strong>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</strong><em>&nbsp;</em><em>Potential Preventable Burden</em>Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant disorder caused primarily by mutations in the LDL receptor (<em>LDLR</em>) gene (NCBI Entrez Gene 3949) that causes severe elevations in levels of LDL-C, resulting in early atherosclerotic lesions. Children with familial hypercholesterolemia can have TC and LDL-C levels 2 to 3 times higher than those of unaffected children. Familial hypercholesterolemia is generally asymptomatic in childhood and adolescence and is rarely associated with cardiovascular events in the first 2 decades of life (1). The burden of familial hypercholesterolemia is attributable to premature cardiovascular events in adulthood resulting from long-term exposure to elevated serum cholesterol levels and atherosclerosis.&nbsp;Studies conducted before statin use became common suggest that familial hypercholesterolemia is associated with a cumulative incidence of ischemic heart disease in 1 of 6 men and 1 of 10 women by age 40 years. By age 50 years, 25% of women and 50% of men with untreated familial hypercholesterolemia will experience clinical cardiovascular disease (5). Coronary artery disease occurs in 50% of men by age 50 years and 30% of women by age 60 years (7, 8). Mortality from coronary artery disease is greater in adults younger than 60 years with familial hypercholesterolemia. Among adults surviving to age 60 years, the risk of coronary heart disease approaches that of the general population (1, 9).&nbsp;Multifactorial dyslipidemia is defined by elevated levels of LDL-C (&ge;130 mg/dL) or TC (&ge;200 mg/dL) that are not attributable to familial hypercholesterolemia (2). Several longitudinal studies have documented an association between childhood lipid levels in this range and measures of atherosclerosis in adulthood (1). Studies show that tracking lipid levels from childhood and adolescence to adulthood cannot predict which individuals will have elevated LDL-C or TC as adults (2). In addition, the association between multifactorial dyslipidemia in childhood and adolescence and clinical cardiovascular disease in adulthood is unknown. &nbsp;<em>Potential Harms</em>Most children with elevated lipid levels of a multifactorial origin will not progress to a clinically important lipid disorder or develop premature cardiovascular disease and are therefore subject to overdiagnosis. Screening could result in the labeling of children with a &ldquo;nondisease,&rdquo; parental or child anxiety, or unnecessary or harmful testing and treatment. The adverse effects of long-term use of lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy and lifestyle modification (including diet and physical activity) have not been adequately studied. &nbsp;<em>Current Practice</em>Generally, screening rates for dyslipidemia in children and adolescents seen in primary care have been low. According to the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 2.5% of well-child visits included lipid testing in 1995, and 3.2% included it in 2010 (10). Claims data from health insurance plans report rare use of lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy in 8- to 20-year-olds. Among more than 13 million children, 665 children initiated lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy between 2005 and 2010, for an overall incidence rate of 2.6 prescriptions per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 0.1 to 2.7) (11).<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Screening Tests</strong>Normal lipid level values for children and adolescents are currently defined by population distributions of lipid levels from the Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study, which was conducted in the 1970s (2, 12). In 1992, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) proposed fixed threshold values to define dyslipidemia in children (TC &ge;200 mg/dL, LDL-C &ge;130 mg/dL, or both). These values are slightly lower than the 95th percentile observed in the Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study for both boys and girls at nearly all ages, although there are some age-related variations in adolescence (2, 13).&nbsp;Cholesterol levels vary by sex and age throughout childhood. Total cholesterol levels increase from birth, stabilize at approximately age 2 years, peak before puberty, and then decline slightly during adolescence (2, 14). The accepted cutoff values for elevated LDL-C and TC may overidentify or underidentify children and adolescents, depending on age and sex (2). Abnormal lipid levels in youth are based on population distributions, not associations with health outcomes. It is unclear to what degree elevated lipid levels in children and adolescents 20 years or younger are associated with future disease risk. &nbsp;Elevated lipid levels track modestly into adulthood, making it difficult to predict which children and adolescents will continue to have elevated cholesterol levels as adults (2, 15, 16). Longitudinal studies suggest that elevated LDL-C levels in adolescence predict elevated LDL-C 15 to 20 years later, with a positive predictive value of 32.9% to 37.3% and lower predictive values among younger children (17).<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Levels of TC may be measured with fasting or nonfasting serum testing . Serum (or plasma) TC and HDL-C levels do not change appreciably according to a fasting or nonfasting state. Serum LDL-C levels may be calculated using the Friedewald formula (LDL-C = TC &minus; [triglycerides/5] &ndash; HDL-C). Because accurate calculation depends on triglyceride levels, serum testing requires a fasting state. Direct measurement of LDL-C does not require fasting and is preferred when triglyceride levels are greater than 400 mg/dL (2). Recent guidelines on screening for dyslipidemia in children recommend measuring either LDL-C or non&ndash;HDL-C levels (18).&nbsp;Screening strategies for dyslipidemia in clinical practice include selective or universal screening. Selective screening is based on family history of dyslipidemia or premature cardiovascular disease. Universal screening is based only on age. Cascade screening is a common screening strategy for familial hypercholesterolemia in other countries. Cascade screening involves case-finding among relatives of patients with confirmed familial hypercholesterolemia and testing for genetic variants identified in the first affected relative (ie, the proband). However, the US health system does not currently have the infrastructure to implement cascade screening (2).&nbsp;There are no universally accepted criteria for the diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia. Studies of children and adolescents with familial hypercholesterolemia use several different diagnostic criteria. All of the criteria use a combination of elevated lipid levels, physical findings, family history, or genetic tests to establish the diagnosis (1).<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Treatment of Dyslipidemia</strong>Interventions for dyslipidemia include lifestyle modification (eg, changes in diet and physical activity) and pharmacotherapy (eg, statins, bile-acid sequestering agents, or cholesterol absorption inhibitors).&nbsp;Statins, or 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, have been widely adopted for use in adults with hypercholesterolemia, because these drugs are effective at reducing cardiovascular events in high-risk adults. As a result of their efficacy in adults, statins are one of the first-line medications considered for use in children and adolescents with hypercholesterolemia (2, 19).&nbsp;The appropriate age at which to start statin use in children with familial hypercholesterolemia is subject to debate. Some experts recommend starting statin use at age 8 or 10 years; others, concerned with adverse effects, recommend initiating use at age 20 years (2). The long-term effects of statin use in children and adolescents are unknown.&nbsp;<strong>Useful Resources</strong> The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen for obesity in children 6 years or older and offer them or refer them to a comprehensive, intensive behavioral intervention (B recommendation) (20). The USPSTF found insufficient evidence on screening for primary hypertension in asymptomatic children and adolescents to prevent subsequent cardiovascular disease in childhood or adulthood (I statement) (21). These recommendations are available on the USPSTF website (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).</p>",,171,"<p><strong>Other Considerations</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Research Needs and Gaps</strong>Randomized trials of screening programs are needed to assess the benefits and harms of combined screening and treatment programs for familial hypercholesterolemia in children and adolescents. For both familial hypercholesterolemia and multifactorial dyslipidemia, long-term, controlled treatment trials of lipid-lowering medications, supplements, dietary interventions, or combinations thereof are needed to assess harms, as well as effectiveness to improve intermediate and health outcomes in adulthood (1, 2). These trials should be conducted in racially and ethnically diverse US populations. In the absence of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of screening programs, treatment studies in patients with screen-detected multifactorial dyslipidemia would be informative. In addition, longitudinal studies would help to understand the association between intermediate outcomes in childhood and adolescence and premature myocardial infarction and stroke in adulthood (1, 2). With these studies, it may be possible to consider age- and sex-specific (rather than fixed) cutoff values to define thresholds for abnormal levels of TC and LDL-C (2).&nbsp; There is doubt that long-term RCTs of statin use in children and adolescents with familial hypercholesterolemia can be feasibly and ethically conducted. The feasibility of conducting such trials may increase with use of intermediate outcomes that predict coronary heart disease (2, 22).<strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</strong>&nbsp;This recommendation updates the 2007 USPSTF recommendation on screening for lipid disorders in children, adolescents, and young adults. This recommendation is similar to the previous recommendation in that the evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for lipid disorders in children and adolescents remains insufficient.<strong></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Recommendations of Others</strong>&nbsp; The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&rsquo;s Expert Panel on Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents (18) and the American Academy of Pediatrics&rsquo; Bright Futures (31) recommend universal screening before adolescence (ages 9 to 11 years) and again after puberty (ages 17 to 21 years). Selective screening (eg, based on family history and other risk factors) is recommended for younger children starting at age 2 years. The American Academy of Family Physicians (32) states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening for lipid disorders in infants, children, adolescents, or young adults (up to age 20 years). The UK National Screening Committee (33) indicates that there is insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening, although a project is currently under way to evaluate cascade screening.&nbsp;</p>",,"<p><strong>Importance</strong>Dyslipidemia, a genetic or multifactorial disorder of lipoprotein metabolism, is defined by elevations in levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), non&ndash;high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non&ndash;HDL-C), triglycerides, or some combination thereof, as well as lower levels of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C). Elevations in levels of TC, LDL-C, and non&ndash;HDL-C are associated with risk of cardiovascular disease in adults, as are lower levels of HDL-C and, to a lesser extent, elevated triglyceride levels. &nbsp;<br />Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia occurs in approximately 1 of every 200 to 500 persons in North America and Europe and is more prevalent among populations with known founder effects (up to 1 of 100 persons) (1-3). Familial hypercholesterolemia is variably defined in the literature but generally includes highly elevated LDL-C levels (eg, &ge;190 mg/dL), genetic mutation, or both.&nbsp;Alternatively, dyslipidemia can be a multifactorial disorder, with both polygenic and environmental causes, including obesity. Multifactorial dyslipidemia is defined by elevations in levels of LDL-C (&ge;130 mg/dL [to convert LDL-C values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259]), TC (&ge;200 mg/dL [to convert TC values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259]), or both that are not attributable to familial hypercholesterolemia (4-6). Obesity is associated with slight elevations in LDL-C; it is more strongly related to elevated triglycerides and lower HDL-C. &nbsp;Recent estimates from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicate that 7.8% of children aged 8 to 17 years have elevated levels of TC (&ge;200 mg/dL), and 7.4% of adolescents aged 12 to 19 years have elevated LDL-C (&ge;130 mg/dL) (1, 4, 5).&nbsp;The rationale for screening for lipid disorders in children and adolescents is that early identification and treatment of elevated levels of LDL-C could delay the atherosclerotic process and thereby reduce the incidence of premature ischemic cardiovascular events in adults.&nbsp;<strong>Detection</strong>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the quantitative difference in diagnostic yield between universal and selective screening for familial hypercholesterolemia or multifactorial dyslipidemia.&nbsp;<strong>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</strong>The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence on the benefits of screening for familial hypercholesterolemia or multifactorial dyslipidemia.&nbsp;<em>Familial Hypercholesterolemia</em>The USPSTF found adequate evidence from short-term trials (&le;2 years) that pharmacotherapy interventions result in substantial reductions in levels of LDL-C and TC in children with familial hypercholesterolemia. One short-term pharmacotherapy trial reported a reduction in carotid intima-media thickness. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to address whether treatment with short-term pharmacotherapy leads directly to a reduced incidence of premature cardiovascular disease (eg, myocardial infarction or stroke). The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the association between changes in intermediate lipid outcomes or noninvasive measures of atherosclerosis in children and adolescents and incidence of or mortality from relevant adult health outcomes. &nbsp;<em>Multifactorial Dyslipidemia</em>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits of lifestyle modification or pharmacotherapy interventions in children and adolescents with multifactorial dyslipidemia to improve intermediate lipid outcomes or atherosclerosis markers or to reduce incidence of premature cardiovascular disease. &nbsp;<strong>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</strong>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess the harms of screening for familial hypercholesterolemia or multifactorial dyslipidemia. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess the long-term harms of treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia in children or adolescents. Long-term evidence on the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia was limited to 1 study of statins. Short-term statin use was generally well tolerated in children and adolescents with familial hypercholesterolemia, with transient adverse effects (such as elevated liver enzyme levels). Treatment with bile acid-sequestering agents was commonly associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and poor palatability. The USPSTF also found inadequate evidence to assess the harms of treatment of multifactorial dyslipidemia in children or adolescents. One trial of a low-fat, low-cholesterol dietary intervention in children with multifactorial dyslipidemia showed no harms.&nbsp;<strong>USPSTF Assessment</strong> The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening for lipid disorders in asymptomatic children and adolescents 20 years or younger cannot be determined.</p>",Screening for Lipid Disorders in Children and Adolescents,"Lipid Disorders in Children and Adolescents, Screening, 2016"
"<h3>Risk Factors for CVD</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this recommendation, dyslipidemia is defined as an LDL-C level greater than 130 mg/dL or a high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level less than 40 mg/dL (to convert HDL-C values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259). Most participants enrolled in trials of statin use for the prevention of CVD had an LDL-C level of 130 to 190 mg/dL or a diabetes diagnosis; hypertension and smoking were also common among trial participants.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6""><span style=""font-size: small;"">6</span></a></sup> Persons with an LDL-C level greater than 190 mg/dL were usually excluded from trial participation, as it was not considered appropriate to randomly assign them to placebo. Thus, these recommendations do not pertain to persons with very high cholesterol levels (ie, LDL-C &gt;190 mg/dL) or familial hypercholesterolemia, as they were excluded from most prevention trials.</p>
<p>One trial, JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin), which excluded persons with dyslipidemia or diabetes, evaluated the effect of high-dose rosuvastatin vs placebo in participants with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation10""><span style=""font-size: small;"">10</span></a></sup> The USPSTF previously reviewed the evidence on the utility of CRP as a risk predictor of coronary heart disease and found that although there is an association between elevated CRP levels and coronary heart disease events, there is insufficient evidence that a reduction in CRP levels results in fewer CVD events.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation11""><span style=""font-size: small;"">11</span></a></sup> Additionally, CRP is not currently included in any of the major risk prediction calculators, and the effects of using CRP in addition to traditional CVD risk factors to guide the prescription of statins for reducing CVD risk are uncertain. As such, the USPSTF does not recommend for or against the use of CRP alone as a risk factor in screening to prevent CVD events in asymptomatic adults without a history of CVD.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation12""><span style=""font-size: small;"">12</span></a></sup>&nbsp; In JUPITER, most of the trial participants either also had hypertension (57%) or were smokers (15%)<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation10""><span style=""font-size: small;"">10</span></a></sup>&mdash;risk factors the USPSTF prioritized for determining potential suitability for statin therapy. In the recent HOPE-3 trial, there was no difference in the effects of statins among participants with or without elevated CRP levels.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation8""><span style=""font-size: small;"">8</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>10-Year Risk of CVD Events</h3>
<p>The USPSTF recommends using the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations to calculate 10-year risk of CVD events.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation13""><span style=""font-size: small;"">13</span></a></sup> In 2013, the ACC/AHA released the Pooled Cohort Equations with the publication of new statin therapy guidelines.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup> The calculator derived from these equations takes into account age, sex, race, cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure level, antihypertension treatment, presence of diabetes, and smoking status as risk factors in the prediction model and focuses on hard clinical outcomes (heart attack and death from coronary heart disease; ischemic stroke and stroke-related death) as the outcomes of interest.</p>
<p>This risk calculator has been the source of some controversy, as several investigators not involved with its development have found that it overestimates risk when applied to more contemporary US cohorts, especially those at the lower end of the risk spectrum.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation14""><span style=""font-size: small;"">14</span></a></sup> Although other risk prediction tools are available, they address varying populations, risk factors, and outcomes and have their own limitations. The ACC/AHA risk calculator is, to date, the only US-based CVD risk prediction tool that has published external validation studies in other US-based populations. Other advantages are that it can generate sex- and race-specific risk predictions and that it includes ischemic stroke as an outcome.</p>
<p>Nonmodifiable risk factors for CVD include older age, male sex, and race/ethnicity; however, statin trials have not included persons with only these risk factors. Other risk factors, such as family history of premature coronary artery disease, have not been demonstrated to improve risk prediction in a clinically meaningful way.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation15""><span style=""font-size: small;"">15</span></a></sup></p>
<p>It is important to note that the calculated 10-year CVD event risk derived from the ACC/AHA risk calculator is heavily influenced by age. For example, 41% of men and 27% of women aged 60 to 69 years without a history of CVD will be found to have a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation16""><span style=""font-size: small;"">16</span></a></sup> Many older adults, particularly those aged 65 to 75 years, may meet the recommended risk threshold for treatment with statins in spite of the absence of dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking. No trial data evaluated statin use among persons in this age group without CVD risk factors; thus, the evidence is insufficient to know whether statin use provides them the same or less benefit than in similarly aged adults with CVD risk factors. Decisions about initiating statin use in this age group should be based on shared decision making between clinicians and patients about the potential benefits and harms. Specific recommendations from other organizations for such individuals are discussed in the ""Recommendations of Others"" section.</p>
<p>Periodic assessment of cardiovascular risk factors from ages 40 to 75 years, including measurement of total cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels, is required to implement this recommendation. The optimal intervals for cardiovascular risk assessment are uncertain. Based on other guidelines and expert opinion, reasonable options include annual assessment of blood pressure<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation17""><span style=""font-size: small;"">17</span></a></sup> and smoking status<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation18""><span style=""font-size: small;"">18</span></a></sup> and measurement of lipid levels every 5 years.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup> Shorter intervals may be useful for persons whose risk levels are close to those warranting therapy, and longer intervals are appropriate for persons who are not at increased risk and have repeatedly normal levels.</p>
<h3>Screening and Statin Use in Adults Aged 21 to 39 Years</h3>
<p>The USPSTF systematically searched for evidence on the effect of screening for dyslipidemia in adults aged 21 to 39 years. It found insufficient evidence that screening for dyslipidemia before age 40 years has an effect on either short- or longer-term cardiovascular outcomes.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation19""><span style=""font-size: small;"">19</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation20"">20</a></sup></span> The USPSTF found no studies that evaluated the effects of screening vs no screening, treatment vs no treatment, or delayed vs earlier treatment in adults in this age group. Thus, the USPSTF recommends neither for nor against screening for dyslipidemia in this age group. A separate recommendation statement also found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for dyslipidemia in children and adolescents.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation21""><span style=""font-size: small;"">21</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The USPSTF recognizes the rationale for screening for dyslipidemia in adults aged 20 to 39 years to identify those at risk for the development of early atherosclerosis, including those with familial hypercholesterolemia. Unfortunately, the evidence is lacking in this age group. The USPSTF found 4 trials of statin use for primary prevention that enrolled patients younger than 40 years. However, results were not reported separately for this age group, and it comprised a small part of the overall population.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation19""><span style=""font-size: small;"">19</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation20"">20</a></sup></span> One cohort study compared the effects of statins vs no statins for the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation22""><span style=""font-size: small;"">22</span></a></sup> However, the mean age of patients in this study was 44 years. Given the lack of data on the efficacy of screening for or treatment of dyslipidemia in adults aged 20 to 39 years, the USPSTF encourages clinicians to use their clinical judgment for patients in this age group.</p>
<h3>Statin Use in Adults Aged 40 to 75 Years</h3>
<p>Nineteen RCTs evaluated the effects of statins vs placebo or no statins in adults aged 40 to 75 years without known CVD. Most of the trials, including the recently published HOPE-3 trial,<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation8""><span style=""font-size: small;"">8</span></a></sup> enrolled participants based on an elevated LDL-C level, a diabetes diagnosis, or at least 1 CVD risk factor. Use of low- or moderate-dose statins was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (pooled risk ratio [RR], 0.86 [95% CI, 0.80 to 0.93]), cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.88]), ischemic stroke (RR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.82]), heart attack (RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.57 to 0.71]), and a composite cardiovascular outcome (RR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.63 to 0.78]).<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6""><span style=""font-size: small;"">6</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Among the study populations, the proportion of CVD events prevented (ie, the relative risk reduction) was similar across age, sex, race/ethnicity, lipid level, and other risk factor categories.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6""><span style=""font-size: small;"">6</span></a></sup> Among trials that stratified participants according to a baseline global cardiovascular risk score, similar relative risk estimates were observed among those classified at a higher vs lower CVD event risk.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation10""><span style=""font-size: small;"">10</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation23"">23</a></sup></span></p>
<p>Given similar relative risk reductions, the absolute magnitude of benefit that an intervention with demonstrated efficacy can have in a specific population directly depends on the incidence of disease over time in that population. In other words, the more likely it is that persons in a certain population will have a heart attack or ischemic stroke, the greater the potential reduction in the number of CVD events with statin use will be in that population. This is one of the fundamental reasons for the distinction between a grade B and C recommendation for the population that presents with dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking and a 10% or greater vs 7.5% to 10% 10-year CVD event risk.</p>
<p>In the absence of other risk factors, adults with an LDL-C level greater than 190 mg/dL may still fall below the risk threshold for statin use for CVD prevention. As noted previously, these persons were generally excluded from the prevention trials evaluating the effects of statin use on health outcomes, because expert opinion strongly favors intervention for these individuals. It is possible that the relative risk reduction in this group is higher than in adults with a lower LDL-C level and that the absolute benefit is greater than would be predicted from a risk calculator.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation24""><span style=""font-size: small;"">24</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Dosage</h3>
<p>As previously noted, available RCTs evaluating statins for the prevention of CVD events largely used low and moderate doses. There were no clear differences in estimates of effect when the trials were stratified according to statin dose (refer to the <a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#table"">Table</a> for the drug regimens used in the available trials). The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists meta-analysis showed that greater degree of LDL-C reductions achieved were associated with proportional reductions in major cardiovascular events.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation25""><span style=""font-size: small;"">25</span></a></sup> However, these analyses were based not on randomized comparisons but the degree of LDL-C reduction achieved. The degree of cholesterol reduction may be attributable, in part, to interindividual variability in response to statins, not just statin dosage.</p>
<p>Limited information is available about use of high-dose statins in a primary prevention population. As such, the harms of statin use for the prevention of CVD events in adults aged 40 to 75 years can only be bounded as small for low- or moderate-dose statins. There may be individual clinical circumstances that warrant consideration of high-dose statin use; decisions about dose should be based on shared decision making between patients and clinicians. However, the most directly applicable body of evidence for patients without a history of CVD demonstrates benefits with use of low- to moderate-dose statins.</p>
<p>Available information about use of high-dose statins in a prevention population comes from the JUPITER trial. The trial found an increased risk of physician-reported incident diabetes with statin use compared with placebo after 2 years of follow-up (3.2% vs 2.4%; RR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.05 to 1.49]), which was not reported in trials evaluating use of moderate- or low-dose statins.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation10""><span style=""font-size: small;"">10</span></a></sup> Post hoc analysis subsequently suggested that many of the diabetes cases in JUPITER may have occurred in participants who had other risk factors for diabetes at baseline (eg, impaired fasting blood glucose or obesity).<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation26""><span style=""font-size: small;"">26</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The incidence of CVD events in a population increases linearly with CVD risk level; there is no threshold at which event rates abruptly escalate. As such, any cut point for assessing where the net benefit of statin use shifts from small to moderate for a population requires judgment. Evidence indicates that currently available risk calculators tend to overestimate CVD risk, suggesting that actual benefits may be lower than estimated. Issues to consider include the uncertainty of current risk prediction methods, the overall probability of CVD events occurring in the population, the known and unknown associated harms of statin use, and patient preferences.</p>
<p>The USPSTF concludes that adults who smoke or have dyslipidemia, diabetes, or hypertension and a 10% or greater 10-year CVD event risk should be offered a low- to moderate-dose statin. Adults with diabetes or dyslipidemia and a 20% or greater 10-year CVD event risk are most likely to benefit from statin use.</p>
<p>Clinicians may selectively offer adults who smoke or have dyslipidemia, diabetes, or hypertension and a 7.5% to 10% 10-year CVD event risk a low- to moderate-dose statin. Fewer persons in this population will benefit from the intervention, so the decision to initiate use of low- to moderate-dose statins should reflect shared decision making that weighs the potential benefits and harms, the uncertainty about risk prediction, and individual patient preferences, including the acceptability of long-term use of daily medication.</p>
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement for Initiating Statin Therapy for Primary Prevention in Adults 76 Years and Older</h3>
<h4><strong><em>Potential Preventable Burden</em></strong></h4>
<p>Adults 76 years and older were not included in any of the randomized trials of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6""><span style=""font-size: small;"">6</span></a></sup> Thus, understanding of the potential benefits of initiating statin use for primary prevention in this age group is limited.</p>
<h4><strong><em>Potential Harms</em></strong></h4>
<p>Evidence on the potential harms of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults 76 years and older is very limited. Observational evidence suggests there may be an association between very low cholesterol levels and an increased risk of mortality with advanced age, after adjusting for other risk factors.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation27""><span style=""font-size: small;"">27</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation28"">28</a></sup></span></p>
<h4><strong><em>Current Practice</em></strong></h4>
<p>The most current data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey indicate that nearly half (47.6%) of adults 75 years and older in the United States use prescription cholesterol-lowering medications. The majority (&gt;80%) use a statin alone.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation29""><span style=""font-size: small;"">29</span></a></sup> The survey did not distinguish between the use of cholesterol-lowering medications for the purposes of primary vs secondary prevention, so it is not possible to determine how many of these persons have had a previous heart attack or ischemic stroke. Another study using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which did allow for the differentiation of individuals with and without vascular disease (defined as coronary heart disease, stroke, or peripheral vascular disease), found that the rate of statin use among adults 80 years and older for the purposes of primary prevention increased from about 9% in 1999&ndash;2000 to 34% in 2011&ndash;2012.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation30""><span style=""font-size: small;"">30</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, as part of the Choosing Wisely campaign, highlighted the use of cholesterol-lowering medications in adults with limited life expectancy (ie, 70 years and, most particularly, 85 years and older) among its ""10 Things Physicians and Patients Should Question"" because of the increased likelihood of an overall unfavorable risk-to-benefit ratio.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation31""><span style=""font-size: small;"">31</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
<p>The USPSTF has made other recommendations relevant to the prevention of CVD in adults, including aspirin use for the prevention of CVD,<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation32""><span style=""font-size: small;"">32</span></a></sup> screening for coronary heart disease using electrocardiography,<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation33""><span style=""font-size: small;"">33</span></a></sup> use of nontraditional risk factors in CVD risk assessment,<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation12""><span style=""font-size: small;"">12</span></a></sup> screening for high blood pressure,<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation17""><span style=""font-size: small;"">17</span></a></sup> screening for abnormal blood glucose levels and type 2 diabetes mellitus,<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation34""><span style=""font-size: small;"">34</span></a></sup> interventions for tobacco smoking cessation,<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation18""><span style=""font-size: small;"">18</span></a></sup> behavioral counseling to promote a healthful diet and physical activity for CVD prevention in adults,<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation36""><span style=""font-size: small;"">36</span></a></sup> and screening for and management of obesity in adults.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation36""><span style=""font-size: small;"">36</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
<p>Given the lack of studies on screening for and treatment of dyslipidemia in adults aged 20 to 39 years, more research is needed to examine the efficacy of screening and treatment in this age group. More research is needed to address the efficacy and safety of long-term statin use in this population and to determine effects of earlier vs delayed initiation of statin use, particularly in persons with highly elevated lipid levels (eg, persons with familial hypercholesterolemia). Additional research is needed to further clarify the true predictive accuracy of the Pooled Cohort Equations to predict cardiovascular risk in more contemporary and diverse populations to optimally guide clinical risk assessment. Research is needed to evaluate the optimal frequency of cardiovascular risk assessment, including serum lipid screening. There are limited data on different statin dosing strategies; trials that directly compare titrated statin therapy to attain target lipid levels vs fixed-dose therapy would be of great value, as would studies that directly compare higher- vs lower-dose statin regimens. Such trials should use hard clinical outcomes as endpoints rather than intermediate markers.</p>
<p>Additional research is also warranted on the potential long-term harms of statin therapy, particularly regarding the possible association with increased incidence of diabetes and cataract surgery. Last, research is needed to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in adults 76 years and older. Currently, there is no trial evidence to evaluate the net benefit of initiating statin therapy in this population.</p>

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">This recommendation replaces the USPSTF 2008 recommendation on screening for lipid disorders in adults. When making a recommendation on a preventive medication, the USPSTF uses the systematic evidence review to determine how to identify persons in the general population for whom the USPSTF can be moderately certain about the balance of benefits and harms of a preventive medication on health outcomes.</p>
<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">Accumulating evidence on the role of statins in preventing CVD events across different populations led the USPSTF to reframe its main clinical question &nbsp;from ""which population should be screened for dyslipidemia?"" to ""which population should be prescribed statin therapy?"" Screening for elevated lipid levels is a necessary (but not sufficient) step in the overall assessment of CVD risk to help identify persons who may benefit from statin therapy. In the age range in which statins have been studied for primary prevention, universal screening for elevated lipid levels is required to make this determination. Therefore, the screening framework used in the previous USPSTF recommendation statement is no longer relevant and has been replaced by a preventive medication framework. This recommendation statement focuses on the assessment of overall CVD risk to identify adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who will benefit most from statin use to reduce their risk of experiencing a CVD event. The USPSTF found no studies that evaluated the effects of statin use on health outcomes in disease-free adults younger than 40 years. The research plan that guided the evidence review, which served as the foundation of this recommendation statement, did not consider reduction in LDL-C level to be a sufficient surrogate for health outcomes.</p>

Scope of Review
The USPSTF commissioned 2 systematic evidence reviews to update its 2008 recommendation on screening for lipid disorders in adults. The reviews addressed the benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of dyslipidemia in asymptomatic adults 21 years and older on CVD-related morbidity and mortality; the benefits and harms of statin use in reducing the incidence of CVD-related morbidity and mortality or all-cause mortality in asymptomatic adults without a history of CVD events; whether the benefits of statin use vary by subgroup, clinical characteristics, or dosage; and the benefits of treatment-to-target vs other treatment strategies in asymptomatic adults 40 years and older without a history of CVD events.
Benefits of Statin Use
Nineteen randomized trials (n=71,344 participants) evaluated the effects of statins in adults at increased cardiovascular risk but without a history of CVD events. The median duration of follow-up was 3 years, and 3 trials were stopped early because of observed benefits in the intervention group. The majority of participants were men and white.6
Most of the available trials relied on a composite outcome of CVD events as the primary outcome of interest; the exact composition of this combined end point varied across trials. In general, statin therapy was statistically significantly associated with a reduced incidence of composite CVD outcomes compared with placebo; pooled analysis of 13 trials found an RR of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.63 to 0.78) after 1 to 6 years. Fifteen trials reported on all-cause mortality after 1 to 6 years, and pooled analysis estimated an RR of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.80 to 0.93). Although this estimate was heavily influenced by the JUPITER, HOPE-3, and ASCOT-LLA (Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial—Lipid Lowering Arm) trials10, 40 because of their large sample sizes, the estimate was robust in multiple sensitivity analyses.6
Ten trials reported on cardiovascular mortality. Pooled analysis found an RR of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.88) after 2 to 6 years, although statistical heterogeneity was present and there was some inconsistency in the individual trials.6 Twelve trials provided information about fatal and nonfatal MI. Results were mixed, but most large trials found that statin use led to a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of any MI; the pooled RR after 2 to 6 years of follow-up was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.71).6 Thirteen trials reported on the incidence of fatal and nonfatal stroke. After 6 months to 6 years of follow-up, statin use was associated with a decreased risk of any stroke (RR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.82]).6
Across these outcomes, benefits appeared consistent across different demographic and clinical subgroups, including patients without severe dyslipidemia at baseline.6 Given similar relative risk estimates across a population, the absolute degree of benefit will be greatest in persons with higher baseline risk of experiencing a CVD event.
Fifteen trials used fixed-dose statin therapy, of which the majority evaluated moderate doses; there were no clear differences in estimates when trials were stratified according to dose. Two trials directly compared different statin doses but were underpowered to draw reliable conclusions about clinical outcomes. No studies were identified that directly compared treatment with statins titrated to attain target cholesterol levels vs fixed-dose or other strategies. Although 3 trials used high-dose statin therapy, only 1 (JUPITER) investigated hard clinical outcomes (eg, fatal or nonfatal MI or CVD mortality).6, 10 Thus, direct evidence on whether different doses of statin therapy or treatment-to-target strategies affect clinical outcomes is extremely limited.
Harms of Statin Use
In randomized trials of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD, statin therapy was not associated with an increased risk of withdrawal because of adverse events compared with placebo, and there were no statistically significant differences in the risk of experiencing any serious adverse event. The trials also found no evidence of an increase in cancer or elevated aminotransferase levels with statin use.6
Evidence on the association between statin use and adverse cognitive effects is very limited, but no clear increase in risk was observed.6 A systematic review of RCTs and observational studies on the effects of statin use for any indication on cognition found no statistically significant differences in performance scores on tests of attention, visual perception, motor and processing speed, memory, cognitive performance, or executive function, and no effect on the incidence of Alzheimer disease or dementia.7
Although muscle pain, soreness, or weakness are commonly reported with statin use, there were no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups for myalgia (7 trials; pooled RR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.79 to 1.16]), myopathy (3 trials; pooled RR, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.48 to 2.47]), or rhabdomyolysis (4 trials; pooled RR, 1.57 [95% CI, 0.41 to 5.99]), although the confidence intervals for the latter 2 conditions were very wide because of a low number of reported events.6
Data from 5 RCTs and 2 observational studies provided evidence on the potential association between statin use and diabetes incidence. Pooled analysis of the RCTs demonstrated no association between statin use and increased risk of diabetes compared with placebo (RR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.91 to 1.20]);6 however, the only trial that evaluated a high-dose statin (JUPITER) reported a statistically significant increased risk of diabetes with statin use.10 In post hoc stratified analysis, participants with 1 or more risk factors for diabetes (eg, obesity or the metabolic syndrome) were at higher risk of developing diabetes than those without such factors (hazard ratio, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.07 to 1.54] vs 0.99 [95% CI, 0.45 to 2.21]).26 Observational studies also reported mixed findings; a UK case-control study found no association with statin use,41 but an analysis from the Women’s Health Initiative noted an increased diabetes risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.38 to 1.59]).42
The HOPE-3 trial found that statin use was associated with increased risk of cataract surgery, which was unanticipated and not a predetermined outcome of the trial (3.8% vs 3.1%; RR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.03 to 1.49]). No other trials noted this outcome.
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
No direct evidence from RCTs is available to guide the choice of a specific CVD risk threshold for statin use. However, in the available trials of statin use among adults at increased risk of CVD but without a history of CVD events, benefits have been generally consistent across different clinical and demographic subgroups (even among adults without marked dyslipidemia). As such, the likelihood that patients will benefit from statin use is directly associated with their absolute baseline risk of experiencing a CVD event.
The USPSTF concludes that adults who smoke or have dyslipidemia, diabetes, or hypertension and have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD event risk should be offered a low- to moderate-dose statin. In this population, the higher the underlying 10-year CVD event risk, the greater the likelihood of benefit from statin use. Because the absolute underlying risk is lower, fewer adults who smoke or have dyslipidemia, diabetes, or hypertension and a 7.5% to 10% 10-year CVD event risk will benefit from statin use. As such, any decision to initiate use of low- to moderate-dose statins in this population should involve shared decision making that weighs the potential benefits and harms and the uncertainty surrounding individual CVD risk prediction. It should also take into consideration the personal preferences of each patient, including the acceptability of long-term use of daily medication.
The USPSTF concludes that the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults 76 years and older without a history of CVD cannot be determined.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from December 22, 2015, to January 25, 2016. Some comments asked why the USPSTF recommended evaluation of CVD risk factors in addition to the use of a risk calculator or why it used different cut points compared with the ACC/AHA guidelines. In response, the USPSTF clarified its rationale, noting that trial participants generally had 1 or more CVD risk factors and were not recruited based on any particular calculated risk score or cut point. Reliance on a risk calculator such as the Pooled Cohort Equations alone as a basis for prevention may be problematic, given its possible overestimation of risk in some populations. As such, the USPSTF clarified that the benefits of statin use may be linear according to a patient’s absolute risk level, and any cut points used are only population estimates of benefits. Clinicians should encourage individualized decision making regarding statin use in their patients, given the known potential benefits and harms.
A few comments requested clarification on the I statement regarding statin use among adults 76 years and older. The USPSTF clarified that the I statement pertains to initiating statin use for primary prevention in adults 76 years and older who are not already taking a statin. Some comments requested clarification regarding the optimal dose of statins. The USPSTF clarified that its recommendation for use of low- to moderate-dose statins is based on the fact that most of the trials were primarily of low to moderate doses, and there were no clear differences in estimates of benefit when trials were stratified according to dose.
In addition, the USPSTF clarified that these recommendations do not pertain to adults with very high CVD risk, such as those with familial hypercholesterolemia or an LDL-C level greater than 190 mg/dL, since they were excluded from primary prevention trials. These persons should be screened and treated in accordance to clinical judgment for the treatment of dyslipidemia. Last, some comments inquired about the use of other factors for CVD risk assessment. The USPSTF clarified that CRP level, coronary artery calcium score, ankle-brachial index, and other factors for CVD risk assessment are addressed in other USPSTF recommendations (available at www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org).","<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Cardiovascular disease is a broad term that encompasses a number of atherosclerotic conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, including coronary heart disease, as ultimately manifested by myocardial infarction (MI), and cerebrovascular disease, as ultimately manifested by stroke. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, accounting for 1 of every 3 deaths among adults.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation5""><span style=""font-size: small;"">5</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Statins are a class of lipid-lowering medications that function by inhibiting the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase, which is involved in the rate-limiting step in the production of cholesterol. Statins reduce levels of total cholesterol and LDL-C and, to a lesser extent, triglycerides, and probably have anti-inflammatory and plaque stabilization effects as well.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6""><span style=""font-size: small;"">6</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Potential Benefits of Statin Use</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that use of low- to moderate-dose statins reduces the probability of CVD events (MI or ischemic stroke) and mortality by at least a moderate amount in adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater.</p>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that use of low- to moderate-dose statins reduces the probability of &nbsp;CVD events and mortality by at least a small amount in adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 7.5% to 10%.</p>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to conclude whether initiating statin use in adults 76 years and older who are not already taking a statin is beneficial in reducing the incidence of CVD events and mortality.</p>
<h3>Potential Harms of Statin Use</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of low- to moderate-dose statin use in adults aged 40 to 75 years are small. Randomized, clinical trials (RCTs) of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events have largely used low and moderate doses; under these conditions, statin use was not associated with serious adverse events such as cancer, severely elevated liver enzyme levels, or severe muscle-related harms. However, evidence concerning the association between statin use and diabetes mellitus is mixed, with 1 prevention trial suggesting that there may be a small increased risk of developing diabetes with use of high-dose statins. Myalgia is a commonly reported adverse effect of statins, but placebo-controlled trial data do not support the conclusion that statin use has a major causative role in its occurrence. Evidence for cognitive harms is relatively sparse; further research would be needed to more definitively establish the relationship between statin use and cognitive function. The USPSTF found no clear evidence of decreased cognitive function associated with statin use. These findings are consistent with those from a recent systematic review of RCTs and observational studies assessing the effect of statins on cognition that found no effect on incidence of Alzheimer disease or dementia.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation7""><span style=""font-size: small;"">7</span></a></sup> The recently published HOPE-3 (Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation 3) trial found that statin use increased risk of cataract surgery, which was unanticipated and not a predetermined outcome of the trial.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation8""><span style=""font-size: small;"">8</span></a></sup> None of the other primary prevention trials reported this outcome.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation9""><span style=""font-size: small;"">9</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of statin use for the prevention of CVD events in adults 76 years and older without a history of heart attack or stroke.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that initiating use of low- to moderate-dose statins for the prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater has at least a moderate net benefit.</p>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that initiating use of low- to moderate-dose statins for the prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 7.5% to 10% has a small net benefit. The decision to initiate therapy in this population should reflect an assessment of patients&rsquo; specific circumstances and their preference for a potential small benefit relative to the potential harms and inconvenience of taking a lifelong daily medication.</p>
<p>The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults 76 years and older without a history of CVD.</p>",Statin Use for the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Adults,"Statin Use for the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Adults, Preventive Medication, 2016"

Medium- and high-intensity interventions commonly included face-to-face individual or group counseling or both, with telephone, email, and text message follow-up. These more intensive interventions ranged in duration from 4 weeks to 6 years, with the active intervention period often lasting for 6 months. Interventions were delivered by primary care clinicians, health educators, behavioral health specialists, nutritionists or dieticians, exercise specialists, and lay coaches. Behavioral change techniques included goal setting and planning, monitoring and feedback, motivational interviewing, addressing barriers to change, increasing social support, and general education and advice. Adherence to all interventions was relatively high; adherence to high-intensity interventions was generally lower than for less-intensive interventions. Overall, there appeared to be a dose-response effect, with higher-intensity interventions demonstrating greater and statistically significant benefits.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in the United States.1 Despite overall reductions in death from heart disease and stroke over the past few decades, approximately 2200 persons in the United States die of CVD each day.16 Among adults 50 years and older in 2012, fewer than 40% were performing the recommended amount of physical activity (150 minutes per week of moderate activity or at least 75 minutes of vigorous activity), and fewer than 2% met criteria for an ideal diet. While nearly 50% of adults aged 20 to 49 years were meeting physical activity guidelines, even fewer (1.3% vs 1.8%) were meeting dietary guidelines.16 By not eating a healthful diet and being physically active, US adults without obesity who do not have CVD risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, abnormal blood glucose levels, or diabetes) increase their risk for developing these risk factors and for developing CVD.
Scope of Review
The evidence review for this recommendation addressed whether primary care–relevant counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet, physical activity, or both improve health outcomes, intermediate outcomes associated with CVD, or dietary or physical activity behaviors in adults. Because the focus of this recommendation is adults without known CVD risk factors, the evidence review excluded studies that targeted persons with known CVD, hypertension, dyslipidemia, abnormal blood glucose levels, or diabetes. Included intervention studies could enroll persons who were overweight or had obesity, but studies focusing solely on weight loss (and not healthful eating, being physically active, or both) were excluded. These types of interventions have been included in evidence reviews supporting other USPSTF recommendations (see the ""Useful Resources"" section and the Table). All of the included studies reported at least 1 health outcome (ie, morbidity or mortality), intermediate CVD outcome (ie, systolic blood pressure or lipid level), or behavioral outcome (ie, amount of physical activity per week or fruit and vegetable consumption).3 All included interventions were judged to be either feasible for delivery in a primary care setting or referable from a primary care setting to community resources. Interventions that focused on supervised exercise or controlled diets were not included.
The evidence review also examined interventions to reduce sedentary behavior, as well as the harms of behavioral counseling interventions.
Effectiveness of Behavioral Counseling Interventions
The evidence review included 88 trials (involving 121,190 individuals and 121 distinct intervention groups).3 Interventions that targeted both a healthful diet and physical activity were evaluated in 23 trials, healthful diet only was evaluated in 24 trials, and physical activity only was evaluated in 44 trials. Of the 121 trial intervention groups, 40 were categorized as low intensity (solely print materials or 30 minutes of contact time), 55 as medium intensity (31 minutes to 6 hours of contact time), and 26 as high intensity (>6 hours of contact time).
Patient Health Outcomes
The USPSTF considered 4 trials (involving 51,356 individuals) that reported on mortality,17-20 all of which focused exclusively on promoting a healthful diet. Healthful diets were associated with reduced saturated fat, sodium, and total caloric energy intake and increased intake of fruits, vegetables, and fiber. Few deaths occurred in these trials, and no significant effect was seen in all-cause or CVD-related mortality. Three of these trials also reported on cardiovascular events.18-20 One large trial found no significant difference in major coronary heart disease events,20 while the other 2 trials showed a significant decrease in myocardial infarctions, strokes, and revascularization over 10 to 15 years of follow-up (hazard ratio,0.70 [95% CI, 0.53 to 0.94]). The results, however, were not statistically significant when revascularization was removed from the outcome measure.18, 19
Ten studies examined the effect of behavioral interventions on health-related quality of life. Seven of these studies exclusively targeted increasing physical activity levels. Overall, these behavioral interventions appeared to improve self-reported measures of health-related quality of life, although the effect was not consistent across the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey subscales.3
Intermediate Health Outcomes
The USPSTF considered 34 trials, involving more than 75,000 persons, that reported on intermediate outcomes such as blood pressure level, LDL-C level, and BMI.3 Most of the interventions in these trials were categorized as medium or high intensity. When all good- and fair-quality intervention trials were pooled, they demonstrated statistically significant improvements in systolic blood pressure level (−1.26 mm Hg [95% CI, −1.77 to −0.75]), diastolic blood pressure level (−0.49 mm Hg [95% CI,−0.82 to −0.16]), LDL-C level (−2.58 mg/dL [95% CI, −4.30 to −0.85]), total cholesterol level (−2.85 mg/dL [95% CI, −4.95 to −0.75]), and adiposity measures such as BMI (−0.41 [95% CI, −0.62 to −0.19]), weight (−1.04 kg [95% CI, −1.56 to −0.51]), and waist circumference (1.19 cm [95% CI, −1.79 to −0.59]).3 There was no evidence of an association between behavioral counseling interventions and improvements in levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, or fasting glucose when the interventions were pooled. Among the intermediate outcomes showing a positive association, dose-response effects were seen, with increasing intervention intensity associated with greater improvement in intermediate outcomes. There was limited evidence for effects lasting beyond 12 months.
Health Behavior Outcomes
The USPSTF reviewed 86 trials, involving more than 115,000 persons, that reported on behavioral outcomes such as fruit and vegetable consumption, salt intake, and minutes per week of physical activity.3 Almost all trials used self-reported measures for behavioral outcomes. Although substantial statistical heterogeneity prevented pooled analysis, in general, healthful diet interventions were associated with reduced saturated fat, sodium, and total caloric energy intake and increased fruit and vegetable and fiber intake. Physical activity interventions resulted in an increase of approximately 35 minutes of physical activity per week and 32% higher odds of meeting recommended physical activity guidelines.3 Studies that limited enrollment to persons who did not meet physical activity guidelines at baseline had greater increases in physical activity levels compared with studies that included persons who were already active at baseline.3
Among the 32 trials reporting both intermediate and behavioral outcomes, concordant changes were generally seen in behavioral outcomes when positive findings were seen in intermediate outcomes.3 For example, trials that found significant improvements in blood pressure levels generally also found significant reductions in measures of sodium intake. Studies that found reductions in waist circumference also reported increased physical activity levels. Several studies demonstrated improvements in behavioral outcomes but did not find concordant improvements in intermediate outcomes.
The USPSTF found 4 trials that reported on measures of sedentary behavior.3 Although there were some small but significant effects, the results were not consistent.
Potential Harms of Behavioral Counseling Interventions
Of the 88 trials reviewed by the USPSTF, 14 specifically reported on adverse events.3 No trials reported any serious adverse events related to the counseling intervention. Eight trials reported on the incidence of important patient events, including falls, injuries, and cardiovascular events. Seven trials found no difference between intervention and control groups. One trial in women aged 40 to 74 years reported more injuries among intervention participants over 24 months of follow-up (19% vs 14%; P = 0.03). This trial also reported more falls in the intervention group (37% vs 29%; P < 0.001).21 Four other trials reporting falls, 2 in older adults and 2 in general primary care populations, found no difference between intervention and control groups over 12 months of follow-up.
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF assessed the overall effectiveness of behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity to be positive but small. Counseling interventions result in improvements in healthful behaviors and small but potentially important improvements in intermediate outcomes, including reductions in blood pressure and LDL-C levels and improvements in measures of adiposity. Noting the concordance between behavioral and intermediate outcomes and the apparent dose-response effect of behavioral interventions on intermediate and behavioral outcomes, the USPSTF concluded that the evidence is adequate to establish the benefits of behavioral counseling interventions. The USPSTF concluded that the overall magnitude of benefit related to these interventions for persons without obesity who do not have hypertension, dyslipidemia, abnormal blood glucose levels, or diabetes is positive but small. The potential harms are at most small, leading the USPSTF to conclude that these interventions have a small net benefit for this population.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from November 29, 2016, to January 2, 2017. A small number of comments were received, and all were reviewed by the USPSTF. A few respondents encouraged the USPSTF to issue separate recommendations for behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and interventions to promote physical activity. Other respondents felt that the evidence base was different for the 2 types of behavioral counseling interventions and suggested that the USPSTF assign separate and different grades. The USPSTF carefully reviewed the evidence on interventions that promoted a healthful diet only, those that promoted physical activity only, and those that promoted both. The USPSTF recognizes that the evidence base for these interventions varies, and although the evidence for behavior change was greater for interventions focusing on physical activity, there were no meaningful differences in intermediate or overall health outcomes. After reviewing the evidence, the USPSTF reaffirmed its conclusion that there is a positive but small benefit of behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet, physical activity, or both in persons who do not have CVD risk factors. Patients and health care professionals can decide together, based on patient interest and the availability of local resources, whether a focus on a healthful diet, physical activity, or both is most appropriate. Several comments agreed with the USPSTF's inclusion of language reinforcing the established benefits of healthful lifestyle behaviors and encouraged better definition of the nature of behavioral counseling interventions. The USPSTF retained its emphasis that all patients can gain health benefits from a healthful diet and appropriate physical activity and added language defining both. The USPSTF also clarified that the recommended behavioral counseling interventions are more intensive than just general promotion of a healthful diet and physical activity.","<h3 style=""padding: 1em 0em 0.2em; margin: 0em; color: #222222; font-size: 1.2em; font-style: oblique; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Importance</h3>

In addition, identifying persons at low risk may allow for a reduction in interventions with a low benefit to risk ratio for those not likely to benefit.</p>
<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">Several traditional risk factors are associated with higher risk for CVD events, including older age, male sex, high blood pressure, current smoking, abnormal cholesterol levels, diabetes, obesity, and physical inactivity. Risk factors can be combined in many ways to classify a person&rsquo;s risk for a CVD event as low, intermediate, or high. Several calculators and models are available to quantify a person&rsquo;s 10-year CVD event risk. The Framingham Risk Score (which estimates a person&rsquo;s 10-year risk of coronary heart disease) was 1 of the first widely used risk assessment tools. Persons with a 10-year CVD event risk greater than 20% are generally considered at high risk, those with a 10-year risk less than 10% are considered at low risk, and those in the 10% to 20% range are considered at intermediate risk. The Pooled Cohort Equations (which estimate 10-year risk of myocardial infarction, death from coronary heart disease, or stroke) were introduced in 2013 and were developed using more contemporary and diverse cohort data, with the inclusion of race/ethnicity and diabetes. Persons with a 10-year CVD event risk less than 7.5% are considered at low risk, and those with a 10-year risk of 7.5% or greater are considered at high risk.<sup style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;""><a style=""padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.1em; margin: 0em; color: #0072bc; text-decoration-line: none;"" href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation4"">4</a></sup>&nbsp;The distribution of estimated CVD risk in the US population is highly influenced by age and sex. Population estimates of the distribution of 10-year CVD event risk assessed by the Pooled Cohort Equations, which categorize risk using somewhat different thresholds, and using 2001-2010 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey show that the vast majority of US adults aged 40 to 49 years have an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7% or less (93% of women and 81% of men). Among US adults aged 50 to 59 years, 80% of women and 46% of men have an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7% or less; 42% of women and 7% of men aged 60 to 69 years have an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7% or less.<sup style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;""><a style=""padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.1em; margin: 0em; color: #0072bc; text-decoration-line: none;"" href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation5"">5</a></sup></p>

Good-quality studies comparing traditional risk assessment with traditional risk assessment plus the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC scores are needed to measure the effect of adding nontraditional risk factors on clinical decision thresholds and patient outcomes (CVD events and mortality). Studies are especially needed in more diverse populations (women, racial/ethnic minorities, persons of lower socioeconomic status), in whom assessment of nontraditional risk factors may help address the shortcomings of traditional risk models. In addition, well-designed prospective studies reflective of real-world practice are needed to identify the downstream effects of CAC score on additional testing and procedures.</p>

Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death among adults in the United States, accounting for 1 in 3 deaths each year. Although it remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality, CVD mortality has been decreasing over time in the United States. Currently, the annual incidence of new cases of myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident in the United States is 580,000 and 610,000, respectively.1
Scope of Review
The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review7, 19 to update its 2009 recommendation on using nontraditional risk factors in assessment of coronary heart disease risk.20 Unlike the 2009 recommendation, the current recommendation focuses on 3 nontraditional risk factors—the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score. The USPSTF chose these risk factors because they have the most promising evidence base, are reliably measured, are independently associated with CVD risk or CVD events, and the prevalence and distribution of abnormal and normal values have been described in the target population. The review focused on the health benefits (reduction in CVD events, CVD mortality, and overall mortality) and harms of CVD risk assessment and treatment guided by nontraditional risk factors combined with the Pooled Cohort Equations or Framingham Risk Score compared with using either risk assessment model alone. The review also evaluated whether the use of nontraditional risk factors, when added to existing CVD risk assessment models, improves measures of calibration, discrimination, and risk reclassification.
At the same time, the USPSTF also commissioned a separate systematic evidence review to update its 2013 recommendation on screening for peripheral artery disease and CVD risk assessment with the ABI.21
Accuracy of Screening Tests
The USPSTF reviewed evidence of whether the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score improves calibration, discrimination, or risk reclassification when added to CVD risk assessment models using traditional risk factors. Calibration measures the agreement between observed and predicted outcomes, discrimination measures the ability to distinguish between persons who will and will not have an event, and reclassification measures the ability to (correctly) reassign persons into clinically meaningful risk strata. The USPSTF found 10 articles representing 22 cohorts for the ABI, 25 articles representing 49 cohorts for hsCRP level, and 19 articles representing 10 cohorts for CAC score, although few studies reported all 3 measures; most did not use the published versions of the Framingham Risk Score or the Pooled Cohort Equations as the base model.
In general, all cohort studies examining calibration (5 for the ABI, 9 for hsCRP level, and 8 for CAC score) found that adding 1 of these 3 nontraditional risk factors improved calibration, although preferred measures of calibration were rarely reported and only 1 study (of CAC score) used the Pooled Cohort Equations as a base model. The calibration plots available for hsCRP demonstrate that, although adding hsCRP level improved calibration for some groups, it worsened calibration for others.22, 23 An individual patient data meta-analysis of 18 cohorts found that the ABI improved discrimination when added to the Framingham Risk Score, but only for women.24 A separate analysis of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort (which was not included in the individual patient data meta-analysis) found no improvement from adding the ABI to the Pooled Cohort Equations.25 Evidence (25 studies) for adding hsCRP was inconsistent, showing at most a small improvement in discrimination.7 In the only study that added hsCRP to the Pooled Cohort Equations (MESA), hsCRP level did not improve discrimination.25 Adding CAC score (18 studies) to various risk assessment models resulted in at least a small, and often larger, improvement in discrimination.7 However, the magnitude of improvement decreased as the discrimination of the base model improved. Four studies25-28 that added CAC score to the Pooled Cohort Equations found a very small to small improvement (0.02-0.04) to the area under the curve.
The evidence for risk reclassification was largely similar to the evidence for discrimination. Different studies used different risk strata, but those that used the Framingham Risk Score as the base model generally used less than 10% for low risk, 10% to 20% for intermediate risk, and greater than 20% for high risk, while studies using the Pooled Cohort Equations as the base model used greater than 7.5% for increased risk. In general, studies found that the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score tended to have positive event net reclassification (ie, more persons who had a CVD event were correctly reclassified to a higher-risk category than were incorrectly reclassified to a lower-risk category). The ABI (in women) and CAC score tended to have negative nonevent net reclassification (ie, more persons who did not have a CVD event were incorrectly reclassified to a higher-risk category than were correctly reclassified to a lower-risk category). Because only a few persons in the general population have CVD events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or CVD death) in a given period, this suggests that on balance, more persons would be inappropriately than appropriately reclassified.7
Effectiveness of Risk Assessment and Treatment
The USPSTF found only 1 study that directly assessed the potential benefit on clinical outcomes of adding 1 of these 3 nontraditional risk factors to traditional risk assessment models.29 This fair-quality randomized clinical trial (RCT) assigned asymptomatic volunteers (N = 2137) with no history of CVD to CAC scoring plus risk factor assessment counseling vs risk factor assessment counseling alone. At 4 years, there was no difference in CVD outcomes between the 2 groups; however, the study was not adequately powered to detect a difference in patient health outcomes.29 The USPSTF found no studies that assessed the incremental benefit on health outcomes of adding the ABI or hsCRP level to traditional risk factor assessment. The Viborg Vascular (VIVA) screening trial30 recently reported interim results; this trial randomized men aged 65 to 74 years to invitation for a triple screening (screening for high blood pressure, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and peripheral artery disease using the ABI) or no screening and found a decrease in mortality with screening; however, it was not possible to determine how much of the decrease was attributable to screening for peripheral artery disease and how much was attributable to screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm and high blood pressure, both of which are already recommended screenings.
The USPSTF found no trials evaluating the additional benefit of adding the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score to traditional risk assessment models for guiding decisions about specific interventions to prevent CVD. The USPSTF found a few studies evaluating the use of a nontraditional risk factor as a single intervention to guide decisions about specific preventive medications compared with usual care. Two RCTs (total N = 4626) compared using the ABI to guide decisions to start aspirin therapy vs usual care and found no benefit in CVD outcomes at 7 years of follow-up.31, 32 However, both studies used atypical cutoff points for diagnosing peripheral artery disease, and the results may not be applicable to current practice. One RCT (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin [JUPITER]; N = 17,802) compared hsCRP screening vs usual care to guide high-intensity statin therapy and found benefit at 1.9 years of follow-up in the reduction of CVD events in the hsCRP group.9 However, because the study only randomized persons with elevated hsCRP levels, it is not known whether patients with lower hsCRP levels would also have benefited from high-intensity statin therapy. Further, many of these patients met criteria for statin therapy based on traditional CVD risk assessment and would already have been candidates for treatment. One study (n = 1005) of using CAC score to guide statin therapy found no benefit at 4 years in the reduction of CVD events.33
A systematic review that addressed the effect of screening with CAC score on risk perception, adherence to medication, and behavioral therapies found only 2 studies comparing traditional CVD risk assessment vs CAC score. Neither of these studies found that screening with CAC score was superior to traditional CVD risk assessment for preventive medication use or risk factor management.5
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
The main potential harm of adding nontraditional risk factors to CVD risk assessment is radiation exposure from CAC score testing, although the dosage (0.4 to 2.1 mSv) is relatively low.7 More general potential harms are false-positive test results and subsequent invasive diagnostic procedures (such as coronary angiography). Three studies assessing the effect of CAC score on health care utilization found conflicting results. The Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis by Noninvasive Imaging Research (EISNER) study, an RCT of CAC score use in an academic setting, found no statistically significant increase in downstream cardiac testing and procedures.29 In contrast, a retrospective study of Medicare data found that use of CAC score increased downstream cardiac testing and procedures compared with use of hsCRP and lipid screening,34 while a second smaller observational study found no difference.35 A systematic review of 7 studies found that the prevalence of incidental findings on computed tomography for CAC score ranged from 8% to 58%. The ultimate outcomes of subsequent diagnostic procedures for these incidental findings, whether positive or negative, are not known.36 Two studies found no short-term psychological harms from use of CAC score in CVD risk assessment.37, 38
Treatment with aspirin and statins to prevent CVD events has some potential harms (specifically bleeding and increased incidence of diabetes, respectively), but these harms are generally accepted to be a reasonable trade-off among persons at higher risk of CVD events.39
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF found adequate evidence that adding the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score to existing CVD risk assessment models results in small improvements in discrimination and reclassification. However, the clinical meaning of these changes is largely unknown. Evidence on adding the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score to the Pooled Cohort Equations is sparse, which makes it difficult to infer the clinical significance of these findings. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess whether treatment decisions guided by the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score, in addition to risk factors in existing CVD risk assessment models, leads to reduced incidence of CVD events or mortality. Few studies were available and were either underpowered or used atypical test thresholds for intervention. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the harms of early detection and interventions as small. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of using the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score in risk assessment for CVD in asymptomatic adults to prevent CVD events.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from January 16, 2018, to February 12, 2018. Many comments expressed belief that the evidence for risk assessment with CAC score was strong enough to warrant a separate positive recommendation. Although adding CAC score to traditional risk assessment models improved discrimination and reclassification, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence that this change would translate into improved health outcomes among asymptomatic patients.
Several comments expressed concern that the USPSTF overestimated the harms associated with CAC score testing (radiation exposure, downstream testing). The USPSTF added language to clarify that it determined that the harms associated with the addition of nontraditional risk factors, including CAC score, are small in magnitude.
Several comments noted that the addition of nontraditional risk factors, especially CAC score, is useful for patients whose risk stratification is unclear or for those who fall into intermediate-risk groups. The USPSTF did not find convincing evidence that adding nontraditional risk factors to traditional risk factors improves reclassification in intermediate-risk groups. As clinical practice moves toward a single threshold for treatment, this concern may no longer be relevant in clinical decision making. Some comments also expressed belief that CAC score testing leads to better adherence to preventive therapies (ie, medications and lifestyle changes). The USPSTF carefully reviewed the available evidence and concluded that CAC score testing showed no benefit over traditional CVD risk assessment in preventive medication use or risk factor control. The USPSTF added language to address this point.
Several comments recommended including more information on the differences between the Framingham Risk Score and the Pooled Cohort Equations as well as population distribution of risk. The USPSTF included information in the Clinical Considerations section to clarify these differences and provide more information on risk in the general US population. Last, comments noted that the USPSTF assessment may not be applicable across sex, race/ethnicity, family history, and socioeconomic status. The USPSTF included language indicating the need for more studies in these subpopulations.","<h3 style=""padding: 1em 0em 0.2em; margin: 0em; color: #222222; font-size: 1.2em; font-style: oblique; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"" align=""left"">Importance</h3>

Genital herpes is an STI caused by 2 related viruses, HSV-1 and HSV-2. In adolescents and adults, genital infection often results in outbreaks of blisters (vesicles) in the area in and around the genitals and rectum. These blisters break and leave sores (ulcers) that are often painful. The first outbreak of genital herpes is usually the most painful and may be accompanied by flu-like symptoms, including fever, body aches, and swollen glands. Among persons who have a symptomatic first outbreak, 70% to 90% will have at least 1 more symptomatic outbreak within the first year, with an average of 4 outbreaks.8, 9 Repeat outbreaks are usually shorter and less severe than the initial outbreak. Although the risk of transmission is higher during a symptomatic outbreak, persons with genital herpes can spread the infection to sexual partners even when they are asymptomatic. Studies suggest that up to 85% of persons who are found to be infected with HSV-2 and who report no prior symptoms of genital herpes have a symptomatic outbreak within 6 months of being tested. According to some experts, persons who receive education about genital herpes may be more likely to recognize and report its symptoms. If this is true, some persons who are considered “asymptomatic” may have actually experienced symptoms but not identified them as genital herpes.
There is currently no cure for genital herpes; once infection has occurred, the virus remains in a person for life. For this reason, the prevalence of infection increases with age. Data from the 2005–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey indicate that the prevalence of HSV-2 infection ranged from 1.2% in adolescents aged 14 to 19 years to 25.6% in adults aged 40 to 49 years.10 Overall, 15.7% of persons aged 14 to 49 years in the United States tested positive for HSV-2 infection between 2005 and 2010.10 These estimates, however, should be interpreted with caution; because of a lack of confirmatory testing, these data may overestimate the prevalence of HSV-2 infection. These data also may underestimate the overall prevalence of genital herpes, as they do not account for herpes infection caused by HSV-1. In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, women were almost twice as likely to be infected with HSV-2 as men (20.9% vs 11.5%), in part because of anatomical factors that predispose women to infection.11 Rates of HSV-2 infection also vary by race/ethnicity and geographical region and are higher in men who have sex with men.10
The herpes simplex virus may be transmitted from mother to infant during vaginal delivery. Among women with a prior history of symptomatic genital herpes, nearly 75% will have at least 1 recurrence during pregnancy and about 14% will have symptoms or clinical recurrence at the time of delivery.12, 13 Evidence shows, however, that vertical transmission and subsequent severe neonatal HSV infection are most likely in pregnant women who develop the initial genital infection during pregnancy.14, 15 The overall incidence of neonatal herpes is low.14, 16 Older data from a 2006 study using a multistate pediatric inpatient discharge database estimated the incidence of neonatal HSV infection as 9.6 cases per 100,000 births (95% CI, 4.3 to 12.0).16 The most recent estimate of neonatal herpes incidence comes from a large study in New York City of cases reported between 2006 and 2010. Using a clinical laboratory system, that study found 76 cases of neonatal HSV infection among approximately 571,000 infants—an estimated incidence rate of 13.3 cases per 100,000 live births.17 The study also found that of the 72% of cases for which HSV typing was done, infections were almost equally caused by HSV-1 and HSV-2 (28 vs 27 cases).17 Incidence rates are thought to vary by geographic region and race/ethnicity. In the multistate study, incidence rates were substantially higher in infants born to women covered by Medicaid (15.1 cases per 100,000 live births) vs private insurance (5.4 cases per 100,000 live births).16, 18
Approximately 45% of infants with neonatal HSV infection develop relatively mild skin, eye, or mucous membrane infections; 30% develop a central nervous system infection; and 25% develop disseminated disease.19 Four percent of infants with a central nervous system infection and 30% of infants with disseminated disease may die as a result.20
Scope of Review
The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to examine the evidence on the accuracy, benefits, and harms of serologic screening for HSV-2 infection in asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including those who are pregnant.21, 22 The evidence review also considered the effectiveness and harms of preventive medications and behavioral counseling interventions in asymptomatic populations to reduce future symptomatic episodes and transmission to susceptible sexual partners and infants.
Accuracy of Screening Tests
HerpeSelect (Focus Diagnostics), the most widely available serologic test for genital HSV-2 infection approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, has a pooled estimate of sensitivity of 99% (95% CI, 97 to 100) and a pooled estimate of specificity of 83% (95% CI, 72 to 91).22 A second test, the Biokit HSV-2 Rapid Test (Biokit USA), has a pooled estimate of sensitivity of 84% (95% CI, 73 to 91) and specificity of 95% (95% CI, 93 to 97).22 In the general US population, the positive predictive value of may be as low as 75% for the Biokit test and as low as 50% for HerpeSelect. Western blot is considered to be the gold standard for the serologic diagnosis of herpes. Western blot test results can be obtained by sending a blood sample to a single research laboratory (University of Washington Clinical Virology Laboratory); however, it is not widely available as a screening or confirmatory test for persons who screen positive for HSV-2 on one of the less-specific, commercially available serologic tests. No studies have examined the screening accuracy of serologic HSV tests in pregnant women. Serologic HSV tests may be clinically useful for persons with persistent undiagnosed genital symptoms and in other diagnostic settings.
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment
Currently, there is no cure for genital HSV infection. Antiviral medications are generally used for the management of symptomatic outbreaks and for prevention in patients with a history of frequent symptomatic outbreaks. In studies, many persons identified with asymptomatic genital herpes (ie, they have been infected with HSV-2 and have never experienced symptoms) have a symptomatic outbreak within 6 months of testing. The increasing percentage of genital herpes cases caused by HSV-1 also limits the potential benefit of serologic screening in asymptomatic persons. While HSV-1 infection can be detected through serologic tests, these tests cannot determine the site of HSV infection. Since HSV-1 can cause both oral and genital herpes infections, and oral herpes infection is very common, serologic tests for HSV-1 cannot be used to screen for asymptomatic genital herpes infection. The evidence is inadequate to determine if suppressive antiviral therapy reduces transmission of genital HSV infection between serodiscordant couples with an asymptomatic partner.
Pregnant adolescents and women with new or known history of genital HSV infection should be carefully observed during pregnancy. To reduce the chance of HSV transmission to the infant during delivery, women with active genital HSV lesions at the time of birth are usually offered the option of cesarean delivery. No studies have examined the effectiveness of antiviral therapy to decrease the risk for HSV transmission to pregnant women by an infected partner.
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
Serologic screening in asymptomatic persons will likely result in a large number of false-positive results. Given the limitations of currently available tests, 1 of 2 positive results may be false. Given the test characteristics of the most widely used serologic screening test for HSV-2 and a population infection prevalence of 15%, screening 10,000 persons would result in approximately 1485 true-positive and 1445 false-positive results. Confirmatory testing is not currently widely available and is only performed at a single research laboratory. There are social and emotional harms of receiving a false-positive result, in addition to the potential harms of unnecessary treatment with preventive antiviral medications.23, 24 However, antiviral medications are generally considered to have few harms in nonpregnant adults.21
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
Based on the natural history of HSV infection, its epidemiology, and the available evidence on the accuracy of serologic screening tests, the USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the potential benefits and harms and conclude with moderate certainty that the harms outweigh the benefits of serologic screening for genital HSV infection in asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including those who are pregnant.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from August 2 to August 29, 2016. The USPSTF reviewed and considered all comments received during this period. Several comments supported the USPSTF's analysis and conclusions; some comments noted that the recommendation is consistent with current clinical practice and advice from other organizations, including the CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). A few comments expressed concern that persons with asymptomatic genital herpes infection can (unknowingly) transmit the infection to sexual partners. While the USPSTF understands this concern, given the current lack of accurate, widely available serologic screening tests and the expected high rate of false-positive results that would occur with widespread screening in asymptomatic persons, the USPSTF continues to recommend against routine serologic screening in asymptomatic adolescents and adults. In addition, the USPSTF clarified its language about HSV-1 infection, noting that while HSV-1 infection can be identified by serologic tests, the tests cannot determine if the site of infection is oral or genital.","<h3 style=""padding: 1em 0em 0.2em; margin: 0em; color: #222222; font-size: 1.2em; font-style: oblique; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Importance</h3>

Unlike other infections for which screening is recommended, HSV infection may not have a long asymptomatic period during which screening, early identification, and treatment may alter its course. Antiviral medications may provide symptomatic relief from outbreaks; however, these medications do not cure HSV infection. Although vertical transmission of HSV can occur between an infected pregnant woman and her infant during vaginal delivery, interventions can help reduce transmission. Neonatal herpes infection, while uncommon, can result in substantial morbidity and mortality.</p>

Adequate evidence suggests that the most widely used, currently available serologic screening test for HSV-2 approved by the US Food and Drug Administration is not suitable for population-based screening, based on its low specificity, the lack of widely available confirmatory testing, and its high false-positive rate. Rates of genital herpes due to HSV-1 infection in the United States may be increasing. While HSV-1 infection can be identified by serologic tests, the tests cannot determine if the site of infection is oral or genital; thus, these serologic tests are not useful for screening for asymptomatic genital herpes resulting from HSV-1 infection.</p>

Descriptive studies that characterize variations in current preeclampsia screening practices in various types of health care settings would be helpful for identifying alternative screening approaches to evaluate in clinical studies. Research examining screening algorithms and new markers for screening are needed. Studies are needed to further develop and validate tools for risk prediction using rigorous methodology, including appropriate calibration statistics and validated models that use parameters available in routine care (eg, clinical history and clinical testing). Large studies are needed to compare different approaches to screening and effects on maternal and perinatal health outcomes, as well as long-term health outcomes.</p>

Preeclampsia is a complex syndrome defined by new-onset hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation. Proteinuria is often but not always present. Recent guidance indicates that a preeclampsia diagnosis can be made without proteinuria when other clinical signs or symptoms are present.5
Preeclampsia is a multisystem inflammatory syndrome with an unclear etiology and natural history. Some have theorized that it may be composed of multiple subtypes.2-4 Preeclampsia is thought to involve the abnormal formation of uterine arteries during placental development, possibly resulting in increased oxidative stress and a maternal inflammatory response.2-4 However, these 2 processes may occur alone or in combination.
Preeclampsia is a relatively common condition in pregnancy, affecting an estimated 2% to 8% of pregnancies worldwide.4, 7, 8 Approximately 9% of maternal deaths in the United States are directly attributed to preeclampsia and eclampsia,4, 19 and more than one-third of severe obstetric complications are associated with preeclampsia.4, 20 Maternal complications include cerebrovascular bleeding, retinal detachment, and HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, and low platelet counts) syndrome. Approximately 1% to 2% of preeclampsia cases lead to eclampsia, a severe manifestation of the syndrome characterized by seizures and complications such as brain damage, aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary edema, placental abruption, disseminated coagulopathy, acute renal failure, cardiopulmonary arrest, and coma.4, 8
Fetal and neonatal complications of preeclampsia include intrauterine growth restriction, oligohydramnios, placental abruption, neonatal intensive care unit admission, stillbirth, and neonatal death. Delivery of the fetus is the definitive treatment of preeclampsia; as a result, preeclampsia is a leading cause of medically indicated induced preterm birth and low birth weight in the United States.4, 21 Infants born to mothers with preeclampsia account for 6% of preterm births and 19% of medically indicated induced preterm births.4, 21 Most cases of preeclampsia occur after 34 weeks of gestation. Preterm infants (ie, those born before 37 weeks of gestation) are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality; the risk of poor outcomes increases with earlier delivery.4, 22
Scope of Review
In 1996, the USPSTF recommended screening for preeclampsia using office-based blood pressure measurement for all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit and periodically throughout the remainder of the pregnancy (B recommendation).18 The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to appraise and update the evidence on screening for preeclampsia.
Accuracy of Screening Tests
The USPSTF has previously assessed the accuracy of blood pressure measurements to identify hypertension in adults as adequate.13
Accuracy of Diagnostic Tests
There are several tests for proteinuria, including the protein to creatinine ratio urine test, albumin to creatinine ratio urine test, urine protein dipstick test, and 24-hour urine protein test. Although the 24-hour urine protein test is the gold standard, it is not practical for use in primary care. The USPSTF found variable and limited evidence on the accuracy of these tests.
Fourteen studies (n=1888; 4 good quality and 10 fair quality) assessed the diagnostic accuracy of urine tests in detecting proteinuria compared with 24-hour urine collection (gold standard). Twelve studies assessed the protein to creatinine ratio urine test, 2 studies assessed the albumin to creatinine ratio urine test, and 4 studies assessed the urine protein dipstick test. Evidence on the accuracy of repeat testing was not found.4 All studies of urine protein test performance were conducted among pregnant women with suspected preeclampsia. Six studies took place in the United States, 4 in the United Kingdom, and 1 each in New Zealand, Canada, Chile, and the Netherlands.4 Meta-analysis was not performed due to clinical and statistical heterogeneity across the studies.4
Sensitivity of the protein to creatinine ratio urine test ranged from 0.65 to 0.96 (I2 = 80.5%; 11 studies), with most studies reporting sensitivity greater than 0.81; specificity ranged from 0.49 to 1.00 (I2 = 91.8%; 11 studies). The albumin to creatinine ratio urine test (2 studies) had high sensitivity (0.94 and 1.00) and dissimilar specificity (0.94 and 0.68).4 The automated urine protein dipstick test (4 studies) had sensitivity ranging from 0.22 to 1.00 and specificity ranging from 0.36 to 1.00.4 One automated urine protein dipstick test had both specificity and sensitivity near 0.80. The remaining studies found either high sensitivity and low specificity or vice versa.4
Performance of urine tests for protein varied widely. Issues such as limited information on the diversity of index tests used, study eligibility criteria, prevalence of proteinuria, spectrum bias, and heterogeneity limit the conclusions that can be made about the accuracy of urine tests for protein in routine clinical care. In addition, the studies were conducted among pregnant women with suspected preeclampsia and not in the general asymptomatic pregnant population typically found in primary care.4
Evidence suggests that automated tests have better test performance than manually read tests. The time of day of testing is not predictive of performance for the protein to creatinine ratio test.4
Effectiveness of Risk Prediction
The USPSTF identified 16 multivariable risk-prediction models evaluated in 4 external validation studies.4 The risk models had different outcomes: predicting any preeclampsia, early-onset preeclampsia requiring delivery prior to 34 weeks of gestation, or preeclampsia occurring or requiring delivery after 34 weeks of gestation.4 Five of the 16 externally validated multivariable risk-prediction models had good or better discrimination (c statistic ≥0.80), but all had low positive predictive value (4% to 39%). There was insufficient information on discrimination and no information on calibration from validation studies to comprehensively evaluate model performance.4 In addition, the models used serum markers and Doppler ultrasonography, which are not always available in primary care and are not generally used in the first trimester of routine prenatal care.4 None of the risk models were based solely on patient history or clinical indicators that could be captured during prenatal visits.
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment
No studies directly compared the effectiveness of screening for preeclampsia on health outcomes in a screened vs unscreened population. One randomized clinical trial examined the benefits and harms of a reduced prenatal visit schedule. This trial was an opportunity to evaluate a specific screening approach compared with the standard of care. This fair-quality trial (n=2764) among low-risk pregnant women showed that fewer prenatal care visits (9 vs 14 visits) did not result in worse maternal or neonatal health outcomes at delivery. However, the mean difference in the number of visits between groups was smaller than intended (12.0 [SD, 4.2] vs 14.7 [SD, 4.2]; P <0.001), and the study was underpowered to detect difference for some health outcomes. In addition, the trial was published nearly 20 years ago, and there have since been changes to clinical practice in the United States.4, 23
Although the USPSTF found no recent studies on the direct effectiveness of screening for preeclampsia in improving health outcomes, trial evidence and extensive clinical experience provide evidence of effective treatments for preeclampsia. Antihypertension medications, when indicated, and administration of magnesium sulfate reduce the risk of adverse events. The Magpie Trial (n=10,141), an international randomized clinical trial of treatment with magnesium sulfate, showed a benefit for preventing eclampsia. Pregnant women diagnosed with severe preeclampsia who were given magnesium sulfate had a 58% lower risk of eclampsia (95% CI, 40% to 71%) than women who received placebo.4, 24 Incidence of placental abruption was significantly lower in the treatment group, and there was no evidence of short- or longer-term (≤2 years) harms from treatment for the mother or infant.4, 24 A Cochrane review of anticonvulsant management of preeclampsia found that treatment with magnesium sulfate reduced the risk of eclampsia by more than half and also likely reduced maternal mortality.4, 25
In studies of timing of delivery, trial evidence supports delivery of the fetus to reduce the risk of adverse maternal outcomes in women with preeclampsia after 37 weeks of gestation. The large multicenter HYPITAT (Hypertension and Preeclampsia Intervention Trial at Term) found that immediate delivery of the fetus reduced the risk of composite adverse maternal outcomes in women with preeclampsia after 37 weeks of gestation (relative risk, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.59 to 0.86]; P <0.0001), with no difference in the cesarean delivery rate or neonatal outcomes.4, 26
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
Previous evidence reviews commissioned by the USPSTF found good-quality evidence that measuring blood pressure has few major harms.13 The USPSTF found limited evidence on the harms of screening for and risk prediction of preeclampsia.
The USPSTF identified 2 fair-quality studies that reported on potential harms of alternative approaches to screening for preeclampsia. Neither study found evidence of harms, but both were underpowered to provide evidence on rare clinical outcomes. One was a fair-quality trial (n=2764) that found no difference in birth outcomes (eg, low birth weight, preterm birth, or cesarean delivery) when the number of prenatal care visits was reduced from 14 to 9 visits.4, 23 As noted earlier, this trial was not sufficiently powered to detect differences for rare outcomes related to preeclampsia such as progression to eclampsia, organ failure, stroke, and death.
The second study was a fair-quality, retrospective, before-after comparison cohort study (n=1952) of low-income pregnant Hispanic women. The study did not identify any harms related to preeclampsia diagnosis and birth outcomes when targeted urine protein screening was used for specific indications only compared with routine use in prenatal care.4, 27
One fair-quality prospective cohort study (n=255) conducted in Spain found no difference in anxiety before and after counseling on preeclampsia risk and categorization as high or low risk based on results of a multivariable risk prediction model. High-risk women were subject to changes in their clinical care, and the low-risk group received usual care. Measures of anxiety over time did not change but were collected from less than half of the study participants.4, 28
The potential harms of treating preeclampsia are well established and include preterm delivery, neonatal complications, cesarean delivery, and adverse effects from magnesium sulfate (eg, nausea, headache, blurry vision, and floppy infant) and antihypertension medications (eg, fatigue, headache, and nausea).29
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
Given the evidence that treatment can reduce maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, and the well-established accuracy of blood pressure measurements, the USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for preeclampsia results in a substantial benefit for the mother and infant. In addition, there is adequate evidence to bound the harms of screening for and treatment of preeclampsia as no greater than small. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a substantial net benefit of screening for preeclampsia in pregnant women.
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
Preeclampsia is a complex syndrome among a range of hypertension disorders occurring during pregnancy. Preeclampsia may involve abnormal formation of uterine arteries during placental development or increased oxidative stress and a maternal inflammatory response (or both).2-4 Although the condition may remain stable until delivery, it can rapidly and unpredictably result in serious, even fatal health outcomes for the mother and infant.4

Metformin has a small effect on weight (BMI reduction &lt;1), and this effect is of uncertain clinical significance. Although the harms of metformin use are probably small, evidence regarding long-term outcomes of its use is lacking. In addition, participants in the metformin trials had abnormal insulin or glucose metabolism, and most had severe obesity. This limits the applicability of the results to a general pediatric population with obesity. Orlistat is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in adolescents 12 years and older. However, orlistat also has a small effect on weight (BMI reduction &lt;1), and this effect is of uncertain clinical significance. In addition, orlistat is associated with moderate harms. Therefore, the USPSTF encourages clinicians to promote behavioral interventions as the primary effective intervention for weight loss in children and adolescents.</p>

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">The USPSTF identified several areas in need of further research. Trials evaluating the direct benefit and harms of screening for obesity in children and adolescents are needed. One such trial could implement a systematic screening and treatment program in 1 set of clinics and providers and continue with usual care in a separate set of clinics and providers. Reproducing existing effective interventions and conducting full trials of small feasibility studies are necessary next steps. Further investigations to determine the specific effective components of behavioral interventions are needed. Long-term follow-up of participants after completion of treatment is needed to confirm maintenance of weight loss and to assess long-term benefits and harms. More studies are needed that address behavioral interventions in diverse populations and younger children (age &le;5 years). Also, more evidence is needed about what constitutes clinically important health benefits and the amount of weight loss associated with those health benefits. The quality of study methods and reporting in recent studies is much better than in the earlier literature; however, the field would benefit further from improved consistency in how health outcomes are reported. Individual-patient meta-analysis could be beneficial in helping understand the differences between patients who lose weight and those who do not. Efficacy and safety trials of weight loss medications for pediatric populations with obesity are needed</p>

Recent prevalence figures from 2011 to 2012 indicate that 17% of children and adolescents aged 2 to 18 years in the United States have obesity.2 Children and adolescents aged 6 to 19 years are more likely to have obesity than children aged 2 to 5 years.2, 3 . Although overt cardiovascular disease can take many years to develop, obesity is associated with poor cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes during childhood (e.g., high blood pressure, abnormal lipid levels, and insulin resistance). In addition, conditions such as asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, orthopedic problems, early maturation, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and hepatic steatosis are associated with childhood and adolescent obesity. Children may experience low self-esteem, impaired quality of life, and teasing and bullying behaviors based on their weight.3
Obesity can have short-term effects on the health of children and adolescents. In addition, obesity in childhood and adolescence often leads to obesity in adulthood, which leads to poor health outcomes. Large, prospective longitudinal studies show that almost 80% of adolescents with obesity will have obesity as adults (70% when BMI is measured at age ≥30 years).3, 14 Approximately 64% of preadolescents with obesity also had obesity as adults. Meta-analyses have shown a strong association between childhood and adult obesity; children with obesity are about 5 times more likely to have obesity as adults than children without obesity.3, 14
Scope of Review
The USPSTF examined the evidence on screening for obesity in children and adolescents and the benefits and harms of weight management interventions. Bariatric surgery, which is limited to patients with morbid obesity, and obesity prevention interventions among children of normal weight were considered to be outside the scope of this review.
Accuracy of Screening Tests
The USPSTF previously found evidence that BMI is an adequate screening measure for identifying children and adolescents with obesity.7-9
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Interventions
The USPSTF found no direct evidence addressing the benefits of screening for obesity in children and adolescents to improve intermediate or health outcomes. Estimated time of contact was the only behavioral intervention component associated with effect size (P <0.001).3, 4 The USPSTF found no evidence for or against the importance of any other specific intervention component.3 Subgroup analysis of prespecified populations (ie, age, race/ethnicity, sex, degree of excess weight, socioeconomic status) was sparsely reported in trials, resulting in an inability to draw any conclusions about differential effectiveness on weight outcomes.3 The USPSTF did not find sufficient evidence on screening in children younger than 6 years. Effective behavioral interventions were targeted at children 6 years and older.3 Evidence on effective interventions in children younger than 6 years is limited.
Behavioral Interventions 
The USPSTF reviewed 45 trials (n=7099) of behavioral interventions for obesity. Of these, 42 trials (n=6956) used multicomponent interventions targeting lifestyle change (e.g., counseling on diet, increasing physical activity or decreasing sedentary behavior, and addressing behavior change) to limit weight gain or decrease weight. Three smaller trials assessed different behavioral approaches (weight loss maintenance, regulation of cues for overeating, and interpersonal therapy).3
Of the 42 behavioral intervention trials (n=6956), 8 were good quality and 34 were fair quality. Half of the trials were conducted in the United States; the rest were conducted in Europe, Israel, or Australia.3 Forty-three percent of trials were conducted in primary care settings and 43% in another health care setting. The remaining trials were conducted outside of a health care setting. Trials included children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years; almost half of the trials were limited to elementary school–aged children (6 to 8 years, up to 12 years).3 Slightly more than half of the participants were girls. Most trials did not report on race/ethnicity or included predominantly white participants. Trials included children with obesity only or both children with overweight and children with obesity.3 Average baseline BMI was 18.7 in trials of preschool-aged children, 23.5 in trials of elementary school–aged children, and 32.2 in trials of adolescents. Time of contact in the interventions ranged from 0.25 to 122 hours (over 1 to 122 sessions); 7 studies had 52 contact hours or more, 9 studies had 26 to 51 contact hours, 11 studies had 6 to 25 contact hours, and 15 studies had 15 contact hours or less.3 Sessions took place over 2.25 to 24 months. Data on follow-up beyond 1 year were limited. Trials with minimal contact time (≤5 hours) were often conducted in primary care settings and involved individual sessions.
All of the effective behavioral interventions included parents and delivered basic instructive information about healthy nutrition and physical activity. Additional components of the most effective interventions included being conducted in a specialty setting; targeting both children and their parents; helping parents and children engage in stimulus control (e.g., limiting access to tempting foods and limiting screen time); and assisting participants in identifying goals, self-monitoring, and problem solving to accomplish their selected goals. Trials with 52 contact hours or more often included supervised physical activity sessions, as did approximately half of the trials with 26 to 51 contact hours.3 Other common components included contingent use of rewards or reinforcement, motivational interviewing, teaching of coping skills, addressing body image, and the option of individual-family counseling to address family-specific issues. All of the effective studies emphasized eating healthy foods and using moderate portions.3
All 7 trials with 52 contact hours or more demonstrated benefits of treatment, with a pooled standardized mean difference in change of -1.10 (95% CI, -1.30 to -0.89; I2=43%) (1 study did not have adequate data to pool). Nine trials with 26 to 51 contact hours showed smaller effects, with a pooled standardized mean difference in change of -0.34 (95% CI, -0.52 to -0.16; I2=24%).3 Among the more intensive trials (≥26 contact hours), intervention groups showed absolute reductions in BMI z score (a standardized measure of BMI based on age- and sex-specific norms to facilitate comparison across ages) of 0.20 or greater. Most participants maintained their baseline weight within 5 lb while growing in height. In comparison, control groups showed small increases or reductions in BMI z score of less than 0.10 or weight gain of 5 to 17 lb (Table 2).3 Interventions were effective in reducing excess weight in children and adolescents after 6 to 12 months. Across all categories of intervention intensity, children in both the intervention and control groups showed a broad range of effects. Some participants had large reductions in weight, some showed no or modest changes, and some continued to gain weight.3 Very limited evidence suggests that briefer interventions may be effective in children with overweight only. Only 3 of the 24 trials with less than 26 contact hours showed statistically significant benefits of treatment. Two of the 3 studies were among children with overweight but not obesity.3 Standardized effect sizes were typically small (absolute BMI z score reduction ≤0.10 in intervention groups). Although the effects in the less intensive trials were seldom statistically significant, intervention groups frequently showed greater average reductions in excess weight than control groups.3
Cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors were consistently reported in studies with 52 contact hours or more. Pooled reductions in systolic blood pressure (6 studies; pooled mean difference in change between groups, -6.4 mm Hg [95% CI, -8.6 to -4.2]; I2=51%) and diastolic blood pressure (6 studies; pooled mean difference in change between groups, -4.0 mm Hg [95% CI, -5.6 to -2.5]; I2=17%) were statistically significant.3 Pooled results did not demonstrate statistically significant improvements in lipid or fasting plasma glucose levels but some improvements in insulin or glucose measures. Cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors were reported less frequently in trials with fewer contact hours, and pooled results were not associated with improvements in blood pressure, lipid levels, or insulin or glucose levels.3
Eleven trials (n=1523) of behavioral interventions reported on quality of life or functioning, self-esteem, body satisfaction, and depression outcomes. Trial results mostly demonstrated small, statistically insignificant increases in quality-of-life scores.3 Five of these trials reported on self-esteem outcomes, and 5 reported on body satisfaction outcomes; no between-group differences were found.3 One trial reported no group differences in the percentage of participants screening positive for depression. No trials reported on other health outcomes, such as morbidity associated with type 2 diabetes or hypertension, orthopedic pain, sleep apnea, or adult obesity.3
The remaining 3 small trials, which either did not consist of multiple components or targeted weight loss maintenance, did not find benefit.3 The small weight maintenance trial (n=61) found no group differences in body weight, body composition, glucose or insulin levels, or lipid levels. Two small pilot trials (n=82) that targeted overeating used regulation of cues for overeating or interpersonal therapy approaches and found no group differences in BMI z score or BMI.3
Pharmacotherapy Interventions
Metformin and orlistat are associated with small reductions in excess weight (BMI reduction <1 [about 5 to 7 lb]) compared with placebo, and both have mild to moderate gastrointestinal adverse effects, which, when considered collectively, provide small or no benefit on health outcomes.
Eleven trials (n=1395) examined the benefits of pharmacotherapy interventions compared with placebo. Ten of these trials were fair quality, and the remaining trial was good quality. A little more than one-half of the trials focused on adolescents only; the rest included younger children. Approximately two-thirds of the participants were girls.3 None of the trials were conducted in a primary care setting; rather, trials took place in pediatric obesity, endocrine, or research clinics. Trials were conducted in the United States (64%), the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Germany, and Switzerland. Among trials that reported race/ethnicity, 25% to 89% of participants were white. Most pharmacotherapy trials only followed up participants for 6 months.3 Only 1 trial assessed the effects of pharmacotherapy after discontinuation.
The average baseline BMI in the pharmacotherapy intervention trials (36.0 vs 37.4 in metformin and orlistat trials, respectively) was higher than in the behavioral intervention trials. Adherence was reported inconsistently.3 All but 1 pharmacotherapy trial included behavioral interventions, while 3 trials offered group physical activity sessions; none involved primary care clinicians. Metformin dosage ranged from 1 to 2 g/d; orlistat dosage was 360 mg/d in all 3 trials.3
Metformin. One good-quality and 7 fair-quality trials (n=616) showed small effect sizes on weight reduction in intervention groups compared with placebo. Pooled results from 6 studies showed a reduction in BMI z score of -0.10 (95% CI, -0.17 to -0.03; I2=13%) and a reduction in BMI of -0.86 (95% CI, -1.44 to -0.29; I2=0%). All participants had abnormal insulin or glucose metabolism.3 Most participants also met adult criteria for severe obesity. Trials showed no benefit on blood pressure or lipid levels and a small benefit on insulin or glucose levels. No metformin trials reported health outcomes.3 One trial demonstrated that the effect of metformin dissipates after 12 to 24 weeks of discontinuation.3
Orlistat. Three fair-quality trials (n=779) showed small reductions in excess weight in intervention groups compared with placebo. Orlistat was associated with small reductions in BMI ranging from -0.94 (95% CI, -1.58 to -0.30) to -0.50 (95% CI, -7.62 to 6.62) and weight ranging from -3.90 kg (95% CI, -25.54 to 17.74) to -2.61 kg (95% CI not reported; P<0.001).3 The 1 trial reporting BMI z score showed a between-group difference of -0.06 (95% CI, -0.12 to 0.00). Most studies found no benefits on cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors, except for a reduction in diastolic blood pressure levels in 1 trial (mean difference in change, -1.81 mm Hg [95% CI not reported]; P=0.04). One trial reported quality-of-life measures and found no differences between intervention and placebo groups at 6 months.3
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment or Interventions
The USPSTF found no direct evidence addressing the harms of screening for obesity in children and adolescents.
Behavioral Interventions 
Ten trials (n=1232) examined the harms of behavioral interventions. Four trials were good quality and 6 were fair quality. Five trials found no adverse or serious adverse events in the intervention group. Five trials found no group differences in disordered eating or body dissatisfaction.3
Pharmacotherapy Interventions
Fourteen trials (n=1484) examined the adverse effects of pharmacotherapy.
Metformin. Eleven trials (n=705) examined the harms of metformin. Ten trials were fair quality, and the remaining trial was good quality. Gastrointestinal adverse effects (eg, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea) were common in both the intervention and placebo groups but not serious. Vomiting, for example, was reported by 15% to 42% of participants taking metformin in 2 trials and by 3% to 21% of control group participants.3  Rates of discontinuation due to adverse effects were 3.8% in the metformin groups and 3.2% in the placebo groups. Trials showed no differences in kidney or liver function. No cases of lactic acidosis were reported.3
Orlistat. Three fair-quality trials (n=779) found that gastrointestinal adverse effects were more common in the intervention groups than in the placebo groups.3 Gastrointestinal adverse effects were common among patients taking orlistat. Fatty or oily stools were reported by 50% to 70% of participants taking orlistat and 0% to 8% of those taking placebo, and uncontrolled passage of stool or oil was reported by 60% of participants taking orlistat and 11% of those taking placebo.3 Abdominal pain or cramping were reported by 16% to 65% of participants taking orlistat and 11% to 26% of those taking placebo; flatus with discharge was reported by 20% to 43% of those taking orlistat and 3% to 11% of those taking placebo; and fecal incontinence was reported by 9% to 10% of those taking orlistat and 0% to 1% of those taking placebo.3 One possibly related serious adverse event (cholecystectomy) was reported in a participant who lost 15.8 kg. Rates of discontinuation due to adverse effects were twice as common in the intervention group as in the placebo group (3.2% vs 1.7%, respectively).3 However, prescribing data from the United Kingdom show that rates of orlistat discontinuation among adolescents are about 50% after 1 month.22
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF previously found adequate evidence that BMI is an acceptable measure for screening for excess weight in children and adolescents. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions in children and adolescents 6 years and older who have obesity can result in improvements in weight status for up to 12 months. It found inadequate evidence regarding the effectiveness of less intensive interventions. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the harms of behavioral interventions as small to none and judged the harms of screening to be minimal. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for obesity in children and adolescents 6 years and older is of moderate net benefit.
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
Genetics and various environmental factors play important roles in the development of obesity. Once obesity has developed, an individual’s biochemical feedback mechanisms work to sustain the body’s weight gain.23 Changes in neuronal signaling decrease satiety and perceptions of the amount of food eaten.24 As a result, weight loss can be challenging. Prospective data suggest that cardiovascular risk factors among adults without obesity are similar between those who had obesity as children and those who did not.3, 25 This suggests that adverse cardiovascular effects in childhood may be reversible with weight loss. This is of particular importance because obesity in childhood and adolescence may continue into adulthood and lead to poor health outcomes.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from November 1 to November 28, 2016. Many comments asked about the components of effective interventions. In response, the USPSTF added language in the ""Effectiveness of Early Detection and Interventions"" section to describe the components of effective interventions and the types of health professionals who would deliver care in these interventions. Another frequently raised concern was the lack of a recommendation for children younger than 6 years. The USPSTF added language in the aforementioned section on the lack of sufficient evidence in young children. The USPSTF added language about subgroup analyses, access, and research gaps based on comments.","<h3 style=""padding: 1em 0em 0.2em; margin: 0em; color: #222222; font-size: 1.2em; font-style: oblique; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Importance</h3>

<h4 style=""padding: 1em 0em 0em; margin: 0em; font-size: 12px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">Numerous gynecologic conditions may be detected during a screening pelvic examination. These include malignant diseases, such as ovarian, uterine, vaginal, and cervical cancer; infectious diseases, such as bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis, genital warts, genital herpes, trichomoniasis, and pelvic inflammatory disease; and other benign conditions, such as cervical polyps, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, dysfunction of the pelvic wall and floor, and uterine fibroids.</p>
<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">The accuracy of detecting and the benefit of treating some of these conditions early, while women are asymptomatic, is unknown. No studies evaluated the effectiveness of early diagnosis and treatment of screen-detected, asymptomatic gynecologic conditions compared with the diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic gynecologic conditions.<sup style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;""><a style=""padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.1em; margin: 0em; color: #0072bc; text-decoration: none;"" href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4"">4</a></sup>&nbsp;It is also unknown whether performing screening pelvic examinations more frequently than every 3 to 5 years (the recommended screening interval for cervical cancer) is beneficial. Although it is common practice to perform a pelvic examination as part of an annual physical examination, the benefit of performing screening pelvic examinations at this interval is unclear. The benefit of using pelvic examination alone to screen for gynecologic conditions other than cervical cancer, gonorrhea, and chlamydia is also unknown.</p>
<h4 style=""padding: 1em 0em 0em; margin: 0em; font-size: 12px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Potential Harms</h4>
<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">The USPSTF found limited evidence on the harms of screening with pelvic examination. Harms reported in studies included false-positive and false-negative results. Available evidence reports false-positive rates for ovarian cancer of 1.2% to 8.6% and false-negative rates of 0% to 100%.<sup style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;""><a style=""padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.1em; margin: 0em; color: #0072bc; text-decoration: none;"" href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4"">4</a></sup>&nbsp;Pelvic examination screening also could result in unnecessary diagnostic workup and treatment. In particular, there is a concern for potential invasive diagnostic procedures and treatment of ovarian cancer (such as surgery) that could result from evaluating abnormal findings on pelvic examination. In the reviewed studies, approximately 5% to 36% of women who had abnormal pelvic examination findings went on to have surgery.<sup style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;""><a style=""padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.1em; margin: 0em; color: #0072bc; text-decoration: none;"" href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4"">4</a></sup>&nbsp;The potential association between urinary tract infections and pelvic examinations was explored in a single study with inconclusive results.<sup style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;""><a style=""padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.1em; margin: 0em; color: #0072bc; text-decoration: none;"" href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation6"">6</a></sup>&nbsp;Additional theoretical harms of pelvic examination include psychological harms (anxiety), pain and discomfort from the examination, and the potential for these harms to serve as a barrier for women to receive medical care.</p>
<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">In the absence of clear evidence on the balance of benefits and harms of using pelvic examination to screen for asymptomatic gynecologic conditions, clinicians are encouraged to consider the patient&rsquo;s risk factors for various gynecologic conditions and the patient&rsquo;s values and preferences, and engage in shared decisionmaking with the patient to determine whether to perform a pelvic examination.</p>

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">The USPSTF recognizes that research on the effectiveness of the screening pelvic examination is difficult, given that multiple conditions could potentially be detected with this single preventive service. However, in reviewing the currently available evidence on the benefits and harms of performing screening pelvic examinations in asymptomatic adult women, the USPSTF identified the following critical evidence gaps. Studies evaluating the accuracy and effectiveness of screening pelvic examination to detect conditions other than ovarian cancer, bacterial vaginosis, genital herpes, and trichomoniasis are lacking. Studies reporting on the harms of screening with pelvic examination (including quantified psychological harms) in asymptomatic women in primary care are also lacking.</p>
<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">Studies reporting the effects of performing routine screening pelvic examinations on health outcomes such as all-cause mortality, disease-specific morbidity and mortality, quality of life, and psychological benefits and harms could help fill the gaps in the existing evidence and inform future USPSTF recommendations. Studies evaluating and quantifying harms are needed, as well as studies evaluating the potential effectiveness of risk assessment tools to determine which women might benefit from a pelvic examination. Research is needed to clarify which indications primary care clinicians are currently using the screening pelvic examination for in asymptomatic patients and which components of the pelvic examination are performed most frequently. Studies exploring women&rsquo;s attitudes toward pelvic examinations, the outcomes women value from these examinations, and how pelvic examinations affect women&rsquo;s decisions to seek and obtain care are also needed to clarify the potential benefits and harms of providing this preventive service.</p>

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">Treatment studies in screen-detected, asymptomatic persons are also needed to understand the effects of adherence to a gluten-free diet (compared with no dietary intervention), as well as the effects of immediate vs delayed dietary changes (ie, at the time of screen-detected diagnosis vs when symptoms develop). Ideally, studies would report both short-term effects on symptoms and quality of life and long-term outcomes (eg, osteoporotic fractures, cancer, and mortality). As for screening, treatment studies focused on asymptomatic persons at high risk for celiac disease who screen positive would be helpful for developing guidance for this population and may be faster and more efficient to complete than other study designs. More research is needed to better understand the natural history of positive serology in patients without histologic changes or with histologic confirmation but no symptoms. Also, treatment studies should report results stratified according to baseline histologic findings, given current uncertainty about the natural history of celiac disease in persons with mild histologic abnormalities.</p>

Celiac disease is caused by an immune response in persons who are genetically susceptible to dietary gluten, a protein complex found in wheat, rye, and barley. Ingestion of gluten by persons with celiac disease causes immune-mediated inflammatory damage to the small intestine mucosa, resulting in malabsorption of nutrients.
Celiac disease can have several different presentations. Classic celiac disease is associated with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. However, celiac disease is also associated with nongastrointestinal, nonspecific manifestations of disease such as anemia, osteoporosis, chronic fatigue, peripheral neuropathy or ataxia, aphthous stomatitis, dermatitis herpetiformis, infertility, recurrent fetal loss, or short stature.3 Children may also experience pubertal delay and dental enamel defects.22 For patients with subclinical disease, symptoms may be mild and not recognized until after initiation of a gluten-free diet. Patients with silent, or asymptomatic, celiac disease have been diagnosed by serologic testing and intestinal biopsy but do not have the typical signs or symptoms of celiac disease. Patients with potential celiac disease have positive serology findings and mild or no intestinal damage on biopsy; they may or may not have symptoms. The natural history of silent and potential celiac disease is not well understood, and it is not clear if they represent progressive stages of celiac disease or distinct subtypes.2
Data on the prevalence of silent celiac disease in the United States, as well as the proportion of these individuals who later develop symptomatic celiac disease, are limited.2 Reported prevalence of celiac disease in the literature varies due to the different racial/ethnic populations studied and the method used to confirm diagnosis.2 In a systematic review of 38 studies from North America and Western Europe, prevalence was similar among studies that included biopsy confirmation (0.15% to 1.90%) and among studies that did not (0.15% to 2.70%).1 In the 3 US-based studies, prevalence among adults ranged from 0.40% to 0.95%.1

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the accuracy of screening in asymptomatic adults, adolescents, and children; the potential benefits and harms of screening vs not screening, as well as targeted vs universal screening; and the benefits and harms of treatment of screen-detected celiac disease. For questions regarding the benefits and harms of screening and treatment, outcomes of interest included morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. The USPSTF also reviewed contextual information on the prevalence of celiac disease among patients without evident symptoms and the natural history of subclinical or silent celiac disease.2 The USPSTF did not review the evidence on nonceliac gluten sensitivity because this condition is defined based on the presence of symptoms rather than diagnostic tests, and it is not thought to lead to the health complications associated with celiac disease.23
Accuracy of Screening Tests
A recent good-quality systematic review on the accuracy of diagnostic tests for celiac disease, which included studies enrolling both persons with symptoms and those whose symptom status was not described, found high strength of evidence that the tTG IgA test has high (>90%) sensitivity and specificity and endomysial antibody (EMA) IgA tests have high specificity, based on consistent results from prior systematic reviews and new studies.24 This systematic review included only 2 studies reporting diagnostic accuracy in asymptomatic persons at higher risk for celiac disease, due to other autoimmune disorders or family history, and no studies in asymptomatic persons at average risk. These 2 cross-sectional studies, which were both conducted outside the United States, found lower sensitivity and specificity for the tTG and EMA IgA tests (sensitivity, 57% to 71%; specificity, 83% to 98%), compared with studies that did not restrict enrollment to asymptomatic patients. One study was conducted in Iraq among patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, no symptoms of celiac disease, and no family history of celiac disease or thyroid disorders. Sensitivity was 71% for both the tTG and EMA IgA tests and specificity was 93% for the tTG test and 96% for the EMA IgA test.25 The second study was conducted in the Czech Republic among children and adolescents at higher risk for celiac disease due to family history or a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Among asymptomatic patients, specificity and sensitivity of detecting antitransglutaminase levels of more than 10 times the upper limit of normal and a positive EMA IgA test result in patients with a Marsh histologic classification of stage 2 or 3 were 67% and 83%, respectively. Among first-degree relatives of patients with celiac disease (n=32), specificity was 70% and sensitivity was 81%. Among patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (n=40), specificity was 64% and sensitivity was 93%.26
Effectiveness of Early Detection or Treatment
The USPSTF found no trials or controlled observational studies on the benefits of screening vs not screening or targeted vs universal screening in asymptomatic populations.
The USPSTF found no studies on the benefits of treatment of screen-detected celiac disease compared with treatment initiated after clinical diagnosis. The USPSTF found 1 small fair-quality trial on the benefits of treatment of screen-detected, asymptomatic adults compared with no treatment.27 This study (n=40) reported that after 1 year, a gluten-free diet was associated with improvements in histopathologic findings and small improvements in 3 of 5 gastrointestinal symptoms that were statistically but not clinically significant (<1 point on a 7-point scale). While there was also improvement in anxiety, no other measures of health-related quality of life showed improvements, and social functioning was worse in the group being treated with a gluten-free diet. After 2 years, more than 90% of participants in the intervention group reported adherence to the gluten-free diet, but there were no differences between the 2 groups in serology or subjective perception of health as measured by the visual analog scale.
Potential Harms of Screening or Treatment
The USPSTF found no trials or controlled observational studies on the harms of screening for celiac disease in asymptomatic populations. Potential harms of screening include false-positive, inconclusive, or unnecessary serologic test results and biopsies, with possible anxiety or complications from testing. However, the USPSTF found no studies on these harms. A subset of patients with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease may never develop symptoms; therefore, overdiagnosis is also a potential concern.2
One small fair-quality trial of treatment with a gluten-free diet27  reported no withdrawals due to major symptoms or complications. The USPSTF found no other studies on the harms of treatment with a gluten-free vs nongluten-free diet in persons with screen-detected celiac disease.
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the accuracy of screening for celiac disease in asymptomatic populations. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the potential benefits and harms of screening vs not screening, as well as targeted vs universal screening in asymptomatic populations. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the potential benefits and harms of treatment of screen-detected celiac disease compared with no treatment or treatment after clinical diagnosis. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for celiac disease in asymptomatic persons.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from May 3 to May 30, 2016. Many comments described patients’ personal experience of a delayed diagnosis because of atypical or nonspecific symptoms. In response, the USPSTF expanded the ""Suggestions for Practice"" section to call attention to the prevalence of nonclassical symptoms, including anemia and osteoporosis, and delayed diagnosis. Another frequently raised concern was the higher risk among relatives of patients with celiac disease and patients with other autoimmune diseases. The USPSTF revised the ""Research Needs and Gaps"" section to emphasize the importance of developing evidence to guide clinical practice for this population.","<h3 style=""padding: 1em 0em 0.2em; margin: 0em; color: #222222; font-size: 1.2em; font-style: oblique; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Importance</h3>

The USPSTF focused its current recommendation on the general asymptomatic adult population.</span></p>","Burden of Disease
An estimated 637,115 persons in the United States were living with thyroid cancer in 2013, according to data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program.3 In 2017, an estimated 56,870 new cases of thyroid cancer will develop, representing 3.4% of all new cancer cases in the United States, and 2010 thyroid cancer–related deaths will occur (0.3% of all cancer deaths); the highest percentage of deaths will occur among adults aged 75 to 84 years (27.5%). The incidence of thyroid cancer detection has increased by 4.5% per year over the last 10 years, faster than for any other cancer, but without a corresponding change in the mortality rate, which remained at 0.5 deaths per 100,000 persons in 2013.6 The estimated 5-year survival rate is 98% but ranges from 99% for localized disease (68% of cancer cases at diagnosis) to 55% for distant disease (4% of cancer cases at diagnosis).3, 6
Scope of Review
To update its 1996 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review7 to examine the benefits and harms of screening for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic adults. The review also assessed the diagnostic accuracy of screening (including neck palpation and ultrasound) and the benefits and harms of treatment of screen-detected thyroid cancer, which were not part of the previous evidence review.
Accuracy of Screening Tests
Evidence on the accuracy of screening for thyroid cancer using neck palpation or ultrasound is very limited, with only 2 applicable studies for each screening method, all of which compared the screening method with a reference standard in a screening population. Two fair-quality prospective studies from Finland by the same investigator reported low sensitivity for neck palpation to detect thyroid nodules.8, 9 In a study of randomly selected adults (n=253), 5.1% had abnormal findings on neck examination (thyroid nodule or diffuse enlargement), and sensitivity and specificity to detect thyroid nodules were 11.6% (95% CI, 5.1% to 21.6%) and 97.3% (95% CI, 93.8% to 99.1%), respectively.7, 8 One study of women presenting for mammography (n=101) reported sensitivity of 27.8% for neck palpation to detect thyroid nodules in women with an abnormal ultrasound finding (women with negative neck palpation findings were not followed up, so the false-positive rate could not be estimated).7, 9
Two fair-quality population-based studies, both conducted in South Korea by the same investigator, reported on diagnostic accuracy of screening using ultrasound only.10, 11 The prospective study (n=2079 screened; 113 referred for biopsy with fine needle aspiration) found that the sensitivity and specificity of having 1 or more malignant features (ie, microcalcification or irregular shape) detected on screening ultrasound were 94.3% (95% CI, 84.3% to 98.8%) and 55.0% (95% CI, 41.6% to 67.9%), respectively. A retrospective analysis of 130 asymptomatic persons selected from 1009 persons who had biopsy with fine-needle aspiration, based on ultrasound findings (ie, having ≥2 high-risk sonographic characteristics), reported sensitivity and specificity of 94.8% and 86.6%, respectively (calculated per thyroid nodule rather than per patient; CIs not provided). However, this study did not follow up patients with negative ultrasound findings, and therefore may have overestimated the sensitivity of this screening method.
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment
No studies directly compared patient health outcomes for screened vs unscreened populations. No randomized trials evaluated whether earlier treatment or treatment of screen-detected, well-differentiated thyroid cancer results in better patient outcomes compared with observation (ie, delayed or no treatment).5 Two observational studies (reported in 5 articles)12-16 met the inclusion criteria for benefit of early treatment. One fair-quality, retrospective, observational study using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data from 1973 to 2005 compared survival rates of persons treated (n=35,663) vs not treated (n=440) for papillary thyroid cancer.12 Overall, untreated persons had a slightly worse 20-year survival rate compared with treated persons (97% vs 99%; P <0.001). However, there were statistically significant baseline differences between the 2 groups, and the study did not adjust for potential confounding.
Another fair-quality prospective study conducted in Japan reported the recurrence and survival rates for 2 separate cohorts (1993–2004 and 2005–2013) with papillary microcarcinoma.13-16 In the first cohort, 1055 persons chose treatment with immediate surgery and 340 opted for surveillance. After approximately 6 years of follow-up, 32.1% of patients who opted for surveillance had surgery, and 2 patients in the immediate surgery group and none in the observation group had died. In the second cohort, 974 persons opted for treatment with immediate surgery, and 1179 opted for active surveillance. After approximately 4 years of follow-up, 8% of patients who opted for active surveillance had surgery, and no patients in either group developed distant metastases or died of thyroid cancer. Because of major limitations in the design of both studies (eg, lack of adjustment for confounding), it is uncertain whether earlier or immediate treatment vs delayed or no surgical treatment improves patient outcomes for papillary carcinoma or microcarcinoma.
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
No studies directly examined the harms of screening for thyroid cancer using neck palpation or ultrasound. Overall, evidence on the harms of screening for thyroid cancer is very limited, including harms of diagnostic biopsy with fine-needle aspiration (eg, hospitalization, postprocedural hematoma, and needle tract implementation).5, 17, 18 The USPSTF found 36 fair-quality studies reporting on surgical harms, 32 studies on permanent hypoparathyroidism (hypocalcemia), 28 studies on permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (vocal cord paralysis), 2 studies on surgical mortality, and 15 studies on other major surgical harms.7 The majority of studies were retrospective observational studies, although 3 randomized trials were included. Cohort size ranged from 76 to 13,854 persons. Only 7 studies were conducted in the United States.
Considerable evidence documents the harms of treatment with surgery and radioactive iodine therapy. The rate of permanent hypoparathyroidism varied widely (15 study arms); best estimates were 2 to 6 events per 100 total thyroidectomies, and estimates varied more with lymph node dissection. The rate of permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy varied less (14 study arms), at an estimated 1 to 2 events per 100 operations (with or without lymph node dissection). Sixteen fair-quality studies (n=94,823) provided evidence for potential harms of radioactive iodine remnant ablation or therapy.7 Estimates of a secondary malignancy ranged from approximately 12 to 13 excess cancers per 10,000 person-years,7, 19, 20 and salivary gland harms (eg, dry mouth) ranged from 2.3 to 21 events per 100 persons.7, 21-26
Although no direct studies of whether screening causes overdiagnosis exist, ecological and cross-sectional data suggest that screening for thyroid cancer leads to an increase in incidence without any resulting change in mortality.5 Multiple studies in the United States show a rising incidence in thyroid cancer detection over time, with no corresponding change in the mortality rate.7 The best ecological evidence on the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer comes from South Korea, which has had an organized cancer screening program since 1999.27 Although the program did not officially include screening for thyroid cancer, clinicians frequently offered thyroid screening using ultrasound for a small additional cost. In 2011, the rate of thyroid cancer diagnosis was 15 times the rate in 1993, while the thyroid cancer–specific mortality rate remained stable.27
Autopsy studies provide additional evidence on overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer. A 2014 review by Lee et al28 summarizes 15 studies published between 1969 and 2005 on latent thyroid cancer discovered at autopsy. Of the 8619 thyroid glands incidentally obtained at autopsy, 989 (11.5%) tested positive for papillary thyroid carcinoma. The majority of the tumors were tiny (diameter <1 to 3 mm).
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence on the benefits of screening but determined that the magnitude of the overall benefits of screening and treatment can be bounded as no greater than small, given the relative rarity of thyroid cancer, the apparent lack of difference in outcomes between treatment and surveillance (for the most common tumor types), and observational evidence showing no change in mortality over time after introduction of a mass screening program. Similarly, the USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence on the harms of screening but determined that the magnitude of the overall harms of screening and treatment can be bounded as at least moderate, given adequate evidence of harms of treatment and indirect evidence that overdiagnosis and overtreatment are likely to be substantial with population-based screening. Therefore, the USPSTF determined with moderate certainty that the net benefit of screening for thyroid cancer is negative.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from November 22 to December 26, 2016. Many respondents shared personal stories of how their clinician noticed a lump during physical examination, often prompted by symptoms such as hoarseness or throat pain, and expressed concern that the recommendation would prevent diagnosis of such cancer cases.

Natural menopause occurs at a median age of 51.3 years.6 The prevalence and incidence of most chronic conditions increase with age, and the average US woman who reaches menopause is expected to live another 30 years.7 However, the excess risk for these conditions that can be attributed to menopause alone is uncertain. The evidence supporting menopause as a risk factor for chronic disease is strongest for cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, heart disease is the leading cause of death among women in the United States; in 2013, 289,758 women died from the disease.8 In 2014, there were more than 267,000 hospitalizations for hip fractures among persons 65 years and older, and overall, 69% of hip fractures occur in women.9 By 2025, the estimated annual incidence and costs of fractures in the United States will increase by 50%.10
Scope of Review
To update its 2012 recommendation, the USPSTF reviewed evidence about the benefits and harms of systemic (ie, oral or transdermal) hormone therapy for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women and whether outcomes vary among women in different subgroups or by timing of intervention after menopause. The use of hormone therapy, whether administered orally, transdermally, or locally for the treatment of menopausal symptoms (eg, vasomotor hot flashes or vulvovaginal symptoms) or for other indications is outside the scope of this recommendation.
Benefits and Harms of Preventive Medication
The USPSTF found 18 fair- or good-quality trials comparing the effects of combined estrogen and progestin or estrogen alone vs placebo on the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women.1 Of these trials, the WHI trial was the largest and was the only trial designed and sufficiently powered to evaluate the effectiveness of hormone therapy for primary prevention of the multiple conditions that are the focus of this recommendation statement.
The WHI trial compared 0.625 mg/d of oral conjugated equine estrogens, both with and without 2.5 mg/day of medroxyprogesterone acetate, vs placebo. Other trials used a variety of estrogenic agents (conjugated equine estrogens, estradiol, or transdermal estradiol) and progestogens (medroxyprogesterone acetate, norethindrone, or micronized progesterone) as active study agents. The WHI trial enrolled women aged 50 to 79 years; the average age was 63 years.
The WHI trial provided most of the estimates used to assess the benefits and harms of menopausal hormone therapy. Including the posttrial phases, the WHI trial had up to 13 years of follow-up to assess how risks for chronic conditions changed after women stopped hormone therapy. Data on the effects of menopausal hormone therapy on the risk of chronic conditions for all relevant studies are presented below. Where possible, trial data were combined in a meta-analysis. If this was not possible, trial data are discussed separately.
Coronary Heart Disease
Observational evidence has suggested that there might be a protective effect of menopausal hormone therapy on coronary heart disease; however, the WHI and other trials have not demonstrated such an effect. Pooled results of 3 trials reporting on the risk of coronary heart disease in women randomized to combined estrogen and progestin vs placebo (N=18,081) showed a higher risk of coronary events in women who took hormone therapy (relative risk [RR], 1.23 [95% CI, 1.00 to 1.52]) during a mean follow-up of 5 years; however, this difference did not reach statistical significance.1
Postintervention follow-up of women in the WHI trial showed that 2.4 years after stopping combined estrogen and progestin, risk of coronary heart disease was not significantly different between women who took hormone therapy during the trial and those who received placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04 [95% CI, 0.89 to 1.21]).11
Pooled results of 3 trials reporting on the risk of coronary heart disease in women randomized to estrogen alone vs placebo (N=11,310) showed no statistically significant difference in risk of coronary events between women who took estrogen therapy and those who received placebo (RR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.79 to 1.14]).1
Postintervention follow-up of women in the WHI trial showed that 3.9 years after stopping estrogen alone, risk of coronary heart disease was similar between women who took hormone therapy during the trial and those who received placebo (HR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.75 to 1.25]).12
Breast Cancer
Because estrogen generally stimulates breast cell proliferation, trials of menopausal hormone therapy have reported on the risk of breast cancer as one of the primary adverse outcomes of treatment. Six trials comparing combined estrogen and progestin vs placebo reported on breast cancer incidence. However, only 2 of these trials followed up women for more than 4 years, and only the WHI trial reported on the risk of invasive breast cancer (vs any breast cancer).
During the intervention phase of the WHI trial (median duration, 5.6 years), women assigned to combined estrogen and progestin had a significantly increased risk of invasive breast cancer vs women assigned to placebo (HR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.53]). The risk remained significantly increased during a median postintervention follow-up of 8.2 years (HR, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.08 to 1.61]).13 In the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS), more women randomized to combined estrogen and progestin developed breast cancer during the 4.1-year intervention phase than did women who received placebo, but the results were not statistically significant (HR, 1.38 [95% CI, 0.82 to 2.31]).14
In 3 smaller trials (the Estrogen Replacement and Atherosclerosis [ERA],15 Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions [PEPI],16 and Estonian Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy [EPHT]17 trials), the risk of breast cancer incidence was not significantly different between women randomized to receive combined estrogen and progestin and those who received placebo over 3 to 4 years; however, few cases occurred overall. The fourth trial, the Women’s International Study of Long Duration Estrogen After Menopause (WISDOM), was stopped after 1 year because of the WHI results indicating excess breast cancer risk in women receiving combined estrogen and progestin; breast cancer incidence was not significantly different between groups at 1 year.18
Five trials comparing estrogen alone vs placebo reported on breast cancer incidence; however, only the WHI trial reported on risk of invasive breast cancer. In the WHI trial, women assigned to estrogen alone had a nonsignificant decrease in risk of invasive breast cancer vs women assigned to placebo during the median 7.2-year intervention phase (HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.61 to 1.02]).12, 13 The risk remained lower during the median 6.6-year postintervention phase after the trial had been stopped. The difference between groups was statistically significant during cumulative follow-up (includes trial and postintervention phase; median duration, 13 years) (HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.65 to 0.97]).13
In the Estrogen for the Prevention of Re-Infarction Trial (ESPRIT), the risk of breast cancer was not significantly different between women randomized to estrogen alone and those receiving placebo during the 2-year intervention period (RR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.25 to 3.91]).19 In the ERA trial,15 PEPI trial,16 and Estrogen in the Prevention of Atherosclerosis Trial (EPAT),20 there were few cases of breast cancer, and the results were inconclusive.
Thromboembolic Events
In the WHI trial, women randomized to combined estrogen and progestin had an increased risk of pulmonary embolism (HR, 1.98 [95% CI, 1.36 to 2.87]) and deep vein thrombosis (HR, 1.87 [95% CI, 1.37 to 2.54]) vs women randomized to placebo over a median follow-up of 5.6 years.13 There was no significant difference between groups in risk of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism during the 2.4-year postintervention period.11 Women randomized to estrogen alone had an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis during the mean 7.1-year intervention phase (HR, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.06 to 2.07]); the risk of pulmonary embolism was not significantly higher than in the placebo group (HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 0.89 to 2.05]).13 There was no significant difference between groups in risk of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism during the 3.9-year postintervention period.12
In 3 smaller trials (ERA,15 EPHT,17 and the Estrogen Memory Study [EMS]21) of combined estrogen and progestin, which varied in study duration and outcome measures, there was no significant difference in risk of venous thromboembolism between women randomized to hormone therapy vs placebo over 2 to 3 years; however, the number of events was small. One trial of estrogen alone (EPAT20) reported no venous thromboembolic events in either group during 2 years of follow-up.
Stroke
In the WHI trial, women who took combined estrogen and progestin had a significantly higher risk of stroke vs those who received placebo during the intervention phase (median duration, 5.6 years; HR, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.07 to 1.76]); during postintervention follow-up, stroke risk was not significantly different between the 2 groups (HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.86 to 1.26]).13
Two other trials comparing combined estrogen and progestin vs placebo reported on the incidence of various cerebrovascular events. In the EPHT trial, women randomized to combined estrogen and progestin had an increased risk of any cerebrovascular event vs those randomized to placebo (HR, 2.46 [95% CI, 1.14 to 5.34]).17 In EMS, few events occurred over 2 years, and the results were inconclusive.21
In the WHI trial, women who took estrogen alone had a statistically significantly higher risk of stroke vs those who received placebo during the intervention phase (median duration, 7.2 years; HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.07 to 1.70]). During the postintervention follow-up, the risk was not significantly different between the 2 groups (HR, 0.92, [95% CI, 0.71 to 1.19]).13 In the smaller EPAT20 and the ERA15 trial, few events occurred, and the results were inconclusive.
Cognitive Impairment
Observational evidence has suggested that menopausal hormone therapy might be associated with a protective effect against dementia or cognitive impairment; however, the WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) did not confirm such an effect. WHIMS and the WHIMS estrogen-only trial evaluated the risk of probable dementia or mild cognitive impairment in women taking combined estrogen and progestin or estrogen alone vs placebo. Both studies were subsets of the WHI trial and were limited to women aged 65 to 79 years at baseline who were free of probable dementia. Women who took combined estrogen and progestin had a higher risk of probable dementia than those who received placebo (HR, 2.05 [95% CI, 1.21 to 3.48]) but not mild cognitive impairment.22 Women who took estrogen alone had a higher risk of the composite outcome measure (probable dementia or mild cognitive impairment) (HR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.89]) but not probable dementia alone.23
Gallbladder Disease
In the WHI trial, women randomized to combined estrogen and progestin or estrogen alone had an increased risk of gallbladder disease (HR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.28 to 1.97] and HR, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.35 to 2.06], respectively).24 Risk of gallbladder disease in the combined estrogen and progestin group decreased postintervention but continued to be greater in the hormone therapy group than in the placebo group (median duration, 8.2 years; HR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.52]); risk of gallbladder disease was no longer significantly different at 6.6 years postintervention in the estrogen-alone group (HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.68 to 1.41]).13
Urinary Incontinence
Both the WHI trial and HERS showed a consistently higher risk of self-reported incident urinary incontinence at all time points in women who took combined estrogen and progestin vs placebo. In the WHI trial, women who took combined estrogen and progestin had a higher risk of incontinence at 1 year (RR, 1.39 [95% CI, 1.27 to 1.52]) and at 3 years (RR, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.16 to 2.84]).25 In HERS, women who took combined estrogen and progestin had a higher risk of incontinence at the 4.2-year follow-up (odds ratio, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.3 to 1.9]).26
Two trials, WHI25 and Ultra Low Dose Transdermal Estrogen Assessment (ULTRA),27 provided data on self-reported incident urinary incontinence in women who took estrogen alone vs placebo. In the WHI trial, women who took estrogen alone had an increased risk of urinary incontinence vs those who received placebo at 1 year (RR, 1.53 [95% CI, 1.37 to 1.71]); results drawing on smaller samples at 2 (ULTRA) and 3 (WHI) years of treatment did not show any significant differences in incident urinary incontinence.
Fractures
Pooled results of 5 trials (N=20,499) showed a significantly reduced risk of fractures in women randomized to combined estrogen and progestin vs placebo (RR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.68 to 0.94]).1
The WHI trial showed a significantly reduced risk of total osteoporotic fractures in women randomized to estrogen alone vs placebo (HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.64 to 0.80]).13 The difference was no longer statistically significant in the postintervention phase (duration, 10.7 years); however, this study reported only on hip fractures.12 The ERA trial found fewer fractures of any type in women who took estrogen alone vs placebo, but the finding was not statistically significant (RR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.17 to 1.04]).15
Diabetes
Two trials provided information about the risk of developing diabetes with combined estrogen and progestin (N=17,903) in women without diabetes or not receiving treatment for diabetes at baseline. Combined estrogen and progestin reduced the risk of incident diabetes in HERS (mean follow-up, 4.1 years; HR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.48 to 0.89])28 and self-reported incident diabetes in the WHI trial (mean follow-up, 5.6 years; HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.70 to 0.94]). This risk reduction was no longer observed 8.2 years postintervention in the WHI trial (HR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.05 to 1.34]).13
The WHI trial was the only trial to provide information about the risk of self-reported incident diabetes with use of estrogen alone. During a median follow-up of 7.2 years, fewer women who took estrogen alone vs placebo reported a new diabetes diagnosis (HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.76 to 0.98]). The overall reduction in diabetes risk was no longer observed 6.6 years postintervention (HR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.92 to 1.25]).13
Colorectal Cancer
Four trials reported on the incidence of colorectal cancer in women receiving combined estrogen and progestin vs placebo. In the WHI intervention phase, women who received combined estrogen and progestin vs placebo were less likely to develop colorectal cancer (HR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.43 to 0.89]). Over the median 13.2-year cumulative follow-up period, the risk of colorectal cancer remained numerically lower in the hormone therapy group, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.01]).13 In HERS, there were fewer cases of colorectal cancer in women randomized to combined estrogen and progestin (vs placebo) over a mean duration of 4.1 years, but the results were not statistically significant (HR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.32 to 1.49]).14 EMS21 and the WISDOM18 trial reported no statistically significant differences in risk of colorectal cancer. However, event rates in these studies were low, and the length of follow-up was short (<2 years), which precluded these studies from being combined with the WHI trial and HERS in a meta-analysis.
The WHI trial reported no significant difference in the incidence of colorectal cancer between women randomized to estrogen alone vs placebo during the intervention phase (HR, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.81 to 1.64]) or the cumulative follow-up period (HR, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.85 to 1.51]).13
Other Types of Cancer
Both the WHI trial13 and HERS14 showed no significant difference in the incidence of lung cancer in women who received combined estrogen and progestin vs placebo during the intervention phase and postintervention follow-up. EMS21 reported only 1 case of lung cancer, in the hormone therapy group, and its short trial period precluded it from being combined with the WHI trial and HERS in a meta-analysis.
The WHI trial reported no significant difference in lung cancer incidence between women who received estrogen alone and women who received placebo, both during the intervention phase and postintervention follow-up.13
In the WHI trial13 and HERS,14 the incidence of endometrial cancer during the intervention phase did not differ significantly between women who received combined estrogen and progestin vs placebo. During the WHI postintervention period, statistically significantly fewer women randomized to hormone therapy during the trial phase developed endometrial cancer (HR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.40 to 0.86]) than did women who received placebo.13 Two additional trials, ERA15 and PEPI,16 reported no cases of endometrial cancer; however, the trials were too short to be combined with the WHI trial and HERS in a meta-analysis.
In the WHI trial, there was no significant difference in the incidence of invasive ovarian cancer between women who received combined estrogen and progestin vs placebo, both during the intervention phase and postintervention follow-up.13
ESPRIT29 reported no significant difference in the incidence of ovarian cancer between women who received estrogen alone vs placebo during long-term follow-up (which included a 2-year intervention phase and a posttrial observational phase, for an average of 12.6 years).
There was no significant difference in the incidence of cervical cancer among women with an intact uterus who received either combined estrogen and progestin or placebo in the WHI trial.30
All-Cause Mortality
Pooled results of 3 trials (N=19,580) showed no significant difference in all-cause mortality between women receiving combined estrogen and progestin and those receiving placebo (RR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.17]) during a mean follow-up of 5.2 years. Similarly, pooled results of 3 trials reporting all-cause mortality in women randomized to estrogen alone vs placebo (N=11,961) showed no significant difference between the 2 groups (RR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.17]) during a mean follow-up of 6.8 years.1 A recent WHI analysis showed no significant difference in all-cause mortality between women randomized to combined estrogen and progestin (HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.96 to 1.08]) or estrogen alone (HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.01]) vs placebo during 18 years of cumulative follow-up.31
Subgroups of Interest
Subgroups of interest for this recommendation statement include women grouped according to race/ethnicity; age; duration of hormone therapy use; type, dose, and mode of delivery of hormone therapy; and presence of comorbid conditions.
Trials did not report results for most of these subgroups. Subgroup analyses were limited to those based on race/ethnicity, age, and a small number of comorbid conditions or risk factors. For most outcomes, there were no statistically significant subgroup effects; however, studies may have been underpowered to detect such effects.
In the WHI estrogen-alone trial, statistically significant interactions between age and the risk of all-cause mortality, colorectal cancer, and myocardial infarction, though not total coronary heart disease events, were detected. There were significant trends toward lower risks of these outcomes in younger women (50 to 59 years) and higher risks in older women (70 to 79 years) randomized to estrogen alone relative to placebo.13 However, the multiplicity of outcomes and subgroup comparisons conducted (in these analyses, P values for trend by age group were not adjusted for the large number of tests conducted), as well as the small number of events that occurred for some of these outcomes in the estrogen-alone trial subgroups, limit the strength of these findings. These limitations, along with the absence of significant subgroup effects for most outcomes, led the USPSTF to conclude that the evidence was inadequate to determine that any subgroup had a different balance of benefits and harms.
To date, evidence to determine whether different types, doses, or modes of delivery of hormone therapy have a different balance of benefits and harms is limited.
Timing of Preventive Medication
It has been proposed that hormone therapy initiated closer to the time of menopause may have a more beneficial, or less deleterious, effect on risk of coronary heart disease (and possibly other health outcomes) than hormone therapy initiated later; this proposal has been termed the timing hypothesis. Findings from post hoc subgroup analyses of the WHI trial regarding the effect of timing of hormone therapy initiation on the risk of coronary events are conflicting. In 1 subgroup analysis, women randomized to combined estrogen and progestin within 10 years of menopause did not have the increased risk of coronary heart disease observed in women randomized to hormone therapy more than 20 years postmenopause; however, there was also no beneficial effect in the former group. In contrast, a second subgroup analysis that considered prior hormone therapy use (ie, before trial enrollment), which provides a more accurate assessment of the time between menopause and initiation of hormone therapy, found no difference in coronary risk between early (<5 years) vs late (≥5 years) initiation of hormone therapy. It is important to note that all such post hoc analyses should be considered exploratory (hypothesis forming) and not confirmatory in nature, and are also subject to potential bias.
To date, no good-quality randomized trials have prospectively evaluated the effect of timing of hormone therapy initiation relative to the onset of menopause on associated benefits and harms.
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
Although the use of hormone therapy to prevent chronic conditions in postmenopausal women is associated with some benefits, there are also well-documented harms. The USPSTF determined that the magnitude of both the benefits and the harms of hormone therapy in postmenopausal women is small to moderate. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that combined estrogen and progestin has no net benefit for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in most postmenopausal women with an intact uterus and that estrogen alone has no net benefit for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in most postmenopausal women who have had a hysterectomy.
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
Traditionally, estrogen has been viewed as having cardioprotective effects. The incidence of coronary heart disease in premenopausal women is lower than in men of the same age; this difference decreases as women age past menopause. Estrogen decreases levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, increases levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and has a vasodilator effect. Despite these observations, data from randomized clinical trials show a lack of benefit, or even a harmful effect, of hormone therapy on risk of coronary heart disease in postmenopausal women. Several potential factors, including timing of initiation of hormone therapy with respect to menopause, older age, and presence of atheroma, have been proposed to account for these discrepant findings. Nonetheless, the underlying causes of this lack of benefit are uncertain.
Another discrepant finding is that combined estrogen and progestin is associated with a small increase in the risk of breast cancer, while estrogen alone appears to slightly reduce this risk. Although estrogen generally stimulates breast cell proliferation, some preclinical studies have shown that estrogen can induce breast cell apoptosis if administered under conditions of estrogen deprivation, and that progestin can stimulate breast cell proliferation and formation of new blood vessels. These findings have been proposed as a possible explanation for the apparent discrepant effects of combined estrogen and progestin and estrogen alone on breast cancer risk.32
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from May 16 to June 12, 2017. In response to public comment, the USPSTF modified the title of the recommendation statement to clarify that the patient population under consideration consists of postmenopausal women. The USPSTF clarified that it reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of systemic menopausal hormone therapy (ie, administered orally or transdermally), not local hormone therapy (eg, creams or rings). The USPSTF also provided additional details about the WHI trial, specifying the formulation of hormone therapy used and the average age of women enrolled in the trial. The USPSTF added 2 tables showing the absolute risk increase or decrease of various health outcomes in women receiving combined estrogen and progestin or estrogen alone (Table 1 and Table 2).
In response to comments that some subgroups of women (eg, women aged 50 to 59 years taking estrogen alone) experience a more beneficial balance of benefits and harms than the overall group of women in the WHI trial, the USPSTF expanded its discussion on the interaction between age and health outcomes in the WHI trial in the “Discussion” section. The USPSTF also clarified that the WHI analyses that assessed whether time between menopause and initiation of hormone therapy affects the benefits and harms of hormone therapy were conducted post hoc.
The USPSTF added the word “primary” to the recommendation summary to further highlight that this recommendation statement focuses on the use of hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women, not on its use for the treatment of vasomotor, vulvovaginal, or other symptoms. The USPSTF is tasked with evaluating the benefits and harms of clinical preventive services in generally asymptomatic populations; therefore, the treatment of symptoms is outside of its purview.
The USPSTF agrees with comments regarding the importance of individualized and shared decision making, and states so in the preamble to each recommendation statement. Last, the USPSTF clarified the definition of menopause in the “Rationale” section and added a reference to the Endocrine Society’s guidelines on hormone therapy in the “Recommendations of Others” section.","<h3 style=""padding: 1em 0em 0.2em; margin: 0em; color: #222222; font-size: 1.2em; font-style: oblique; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Importance</h3>
<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">Menopause is defined as the permanent cessation of a woman&rsquo;s menstrual cycle. It is typically defined in retrospect, 12 months after a woman&rsquo;s final menstrual period. Menopause occurs at a median age of 51.3 years, and the average US woman who reaches menopause is expected to live another 30 years. The prevalence and incidence of most chronic conditions, such as coronary heart disease, dementia, stroke, fractures, and breast cancer, increase with age; however, the excess risk for these conditions that can be attributed to menopause alone is uncertain. Since the publication of findings from the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative (WHI) that hormone therapy use was associated with serious adverse health effects in postmenopausal women, use of menopausal hormone therapy has declined, from 44% of US women using or having used hormone therapy in 1988&ndash;1994 to 4.7% of women in 2010.<sup style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;""><a style=""padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.1em; margin: 0em; color: #0072bc; text-decoration-line: none;"" href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation1"">1</a></sup></p>

"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to children who have not been diagnosed with ASD or developmental delay and for whom no concerns of ASD have been raised by parents, other caregivers, or health care professionals.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
A number of tests are available for screening for ASD in children younger than 30 months. The most commonly studied tool is the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) and its subsequent revisions (Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers With Follow-Up [M-CHAT-F] and Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers&ndash;Revised, With Follow-Up [M-CHAT-R/F]). The M-CHAT-R/F is a parent-rated scale, and a positive finding leads to a follow-up interview. If the follow-up interview is positive, a full diagnostic workup for ASD is indicated. The screening process assesses communication skills, joint attention, repetitive movement, and pretend play.
<h3>Treatments and Interventions</h3>
Treatments for ASD include behavioral, medical, educational, speech/language, and occupational therapy and complementary and alternative medicine approaches. Treatments for young children in the target age group for routine screening for ASD are primarily behavioral interventions, particularly early intensive behavioral and developmental interventions, which may include approaches incorporating applied behavior analysis principles, parent training components, and play- or interaction-based interventions. Among the behavioral interventions, those based on applied behavior analysis have the highest-quality data supporting their effects on cognitive and language outcomes. These interventions can be delivered in a home or school setting and are generally time-intensive, with some programs requiring up to 40 hours a week.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-young-children-screening#citation2"">2</a>
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
Autism spectrum disorder can cause significant social, communication, and behavioral challenges for affected children and place substantial strain on family members and other caregivers. Treatment and maturation may reduce the effects of the core symptoms of ASD for some children, but others may experience long-term effects on education, employment, and ability to live independently.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-young-children-screening#citation2"">2</a>&nbsp;It is important that clinicians listen carefully to parents when concerns are raised by the parents or during an examination and make prompt use of validated tools to assess the need for further diagnostic testing and services. Disparities have been observed in the frequency and age at which ASD is diagnosed among children by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and language of origin, creating concern that certain groups of children with ASD may be systematically underdiagnosed.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-young-children-screening#citation3"">3</a>&nbsp;It is important to note that an ""I"" statement is not a recommendation for or against screening. In the absence of evidence about the balance of benefits and harms, clinicians should use their clinical judgment to decide if screening in children without overt signs and symptoms is appropriate for the population in their care.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
Although there is limited evidence about the harms of screening for ASD in children, reported potential harms include misdiagnosis and the anxiety associated with further testing after a positive screening result, particularly if confirmatory testing is delayed because of resource limitations. Behavioral treatments are not generally thought to be associated with significant harms but can place a large time and financial burden on the family. Other treatments for ASD are less well studied and were not included in this review.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
A 2004 survey of pediatricians in Maryland and Delaware found that 8% screened specifically for ASD. Few data are available regarding the current prevalence of screening for ASD by clinicians in the United States.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-young-children-screening#citation4"">4</a>&nbsp;More recent surveys have found higher rates, although they remain less than 60%.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-young-children-screening#citation5"">5-8</a>

Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disorder characterized by persistent and significant impairments in social interaction and communication and restrictive and repetitive behaviors and activities, when these symptoms cannot be accounted for by another condition. In 2010, the prevalence of ASD in the United States was estimated at 14.7 cases per 1000 children, or 1 in 68 children, with substantial variability in estimates by region, sex, and race/ethnicity.1 This represents a 23% increase from 2008; the reasons for this increase are not completely understood.1
Scope of Review
The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review2 to evaluate the evidence on the accuracy, benefits, and potential harms of brief, formal screening instruments for ASD administered during routine primary care visits, and the benefits and potential harms of early behavioral treatment for children identified with ASD through screening. The review focused on studies of screening in children younger than 3 years who were unselected (ie, not identified because of risk factors or concerns regarding ASD).
Accuracy of Screening Tests
Several screening tools for ASD are available, but the strongest and most applicable evidence is for the M-CHAT/F and M-CHAT-R/F, 2 versions of the same tool. Both use a parent-rated scale that can lead to a follow-up interview, which, if positive, leads to referral for confirmatory diagnosis by a behavioral or developmental specialist. The initial screening process takes 5 to 10 minutes. Two large, good-quality trials conducted in the United States in children aged 16 to 30 months found similar positive predictive values for these tools (approximately 50%) for the detection of ASD in unselected populations.11, 12 The validity of these studies was weakened somewhat by the high dropout rate between screening steps but is still reasonably high for mass screening. There are no data on the specificity or negative predictive value of these screening tools. One study followed up a sample of children who were referred for diagnostic evaluation as a result of screening but not diagnosed with ASD and reported that almost all of these children had another form of developmental delay.12 It is not known whether early detection of these other problems results in improved health outcomes. Although a number of potential risk factors for ASD have been identified, there is insufficient evidence to determine if certain risk factors modify the performance characteristics of ASD screening tests, such as the age at which screening is performed or other characteristics of the child or family.
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment
The USPSTF found no RCTs that directly addressed the overarching question of whether screening for ASD in children 3 years or younger results in improvements to core ASD symptoms, cognitive and intellectual functioning, language and communication skill development, challenging behavior, adaptive behavior, educational placement or achievement, or quality of life for the child and family.
The USPSTF found 26 RCTs of early intensive behavioral and developmental interventions (the most often studied treatment for this age group) for ASD in young children. However, assessment of treatment evidence was complicated by the variation among studies in intervention design, method of delivery, comparators, and outcomes measured, as well as by the heterogeneity in the age, types of symptoms, and symptom severity of the children enrolled. Four RCTs reported cognitive and language outcomes for early intensive behavioral interventions delivered by trained clinicians. Three of the 4 trials (including the largest trial, with 294 children) reported that these interventions improved cognitive scores by 11 to 16 points (Mullen Scales of Early Learning or IQ) compared with a range of comparators (calculated from published data).13-15 The fourth RCT found no effect, but this trial compared different ways of delivering the same intervention.16 The same set of studies showed a similar pattern for language outcomes. Twelve RCTs of play- or interaction-based interventions reported significant improvements in some measures of interaction but not others. The other RCTs evaluated various interventions delivered by parents and found inconsistent or negative results. Studies were very small (most enrolled 20–40 children), and study quality was generally fair.
In addition to the limitations of the evidence in size, study design, and other sources of heterogeneity, it is not clear whether these studies are applicable to children who would be detected through screening. Autism spectrum disorder is a highly heterogeneous condition in terms of onset and course of core clinical ASD symptoms and cognitive and language development.17 All of the treatment studies were conducted in populations of children with a previous diagnosis of ASD, many of whom were referred from specialized ASD programs. Many of the children enrolled in these studies had significant impairments in cognition, language, and behavior identified through case-finding and were older than the age group for which the screening tools were developed. Children identified through screening rather than through case-finding are likely to be younger and have milder symptoms than those in study populations. It is therefore not clear whether young children with ASD detected by screening and not because of parental or clinician concern will experience similar benefits from earlier intervention.
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
The USPSTF found little evidence on the harms of screening and treatment. Potential harms include misdiagnosis and the time, effort, and anxiety associated with further testing after a positive screening result. This is of particular concern when there is a delay in confirmatory testing because of resource limitations, which are common.2 Even good-quality studies of screening had a high dropout rate between screening steps and between screening and diagnosis, suggesting that the process may be difficult for some families. Behavioral treatments are not generally thought to be associated with significant harms but can place a large time and financial burden on the family. Other treatments for ASD are less well studied and were not included in the scope of this review. The USPSTF concludes that the potential harms of screening and behavioral treatment are no greater than small.
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
Overall, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence on screening for ASD in children aged 18 to 30 months for whom no concerns of ASD have been raised by parents, other caregivers, or health care professionals. The USPSTF identified no studies that directly evaluated the benefits or harms of screening for ASD in this age group. Studies on the benefits and harms of treatment were of small size, few were randomized, and all were conducted in populations that may not represent children who would be detected through screening programs alone. The USPSTF concludes that there is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for ASD in young children.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from August 4, 2015, to August 31, 2015. Many parents of children with ASD, adults with ASD, and clinicians who care for children with ASD wrote to share their personal experiences and concerns. One major area of concern was a perception that the USPSTF was advocating against screening or against the use of screening tools to follow up on parents’ concerns. This was not the USPSTF’s intention, and the USPSTF will be clear when communicating this recommendation that it is not recommending for or against screening but advocating for more research. In the meantime, clinicians should use their clinical judgment, especially when caring for populations in which case-finding may be difficult because of language, access, or other barriers. Furthermore, clinicians should listen carefully to parents’ concerns and use validated tools to assess whether further diagnosis or services are needed. Standardized tools, such as the M-CHAT, may be used diagnostically to follow up on concerns expressed by parents.
Another area of concern was why studies of test accuracy and the effectiveness of treatment were not sufficient to support screening and what kind of research would be needed to support a positive recommendation. In response, the USPSTF revised the recommendation statement to clarify the lack of treatment studies in the population that would likely be identified through screening and to provide greater detail about the different types of studies that could fill this evidentiary gap. Finally, other comments focused on the low cost and lack of harms associated with screening. The USPSTF revised the recommendation statement to clarify that, while the screening tools are relatively easy to administer and behavioral interventions are generally safe, the potential effects of extended treatment, in the absence of clear benefit, on families in terms of time and resources are not negligible.","<h3><strong>Importance</strong></h3>
<p>Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disorder characterized by persistent and significant impairments in social interaction and communication and restrictive and repetitive behaviors and activities, when these symptoms cannot be accounted for by another condition.

<h3><strong>Detection</strong></h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that currently available screening tests can detect ASD among children aged 18 to 30 months.</p>
<h3><strong>Benefits of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</strong></h3>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence on the benefits of screening for ASD in toddlers and preschool-age children for whom no concerns of ASD have been raised by family members, other caregivers, or health care professionals. There are no studies that focus on the clinical outcomes of children identified with ASD through screening. Although there are studies suggesting treatment benefit in older children identified through family, clinician, or teacher concerns, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the efficacy of treatment of cases of ASD detected through screening or among very young children. Treatment studies were generally very small, few were randomized trials, most included children who were older than would be identified through screening, and all were in clinically referred rather than screen-detected patients.</p>
<h3><strong>Harms of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</strong></h3>
<p>The USPSTF found that the harms of screening for ASD and subsequent interventions are likely to be small based on evidence about the prevalence, accuracy of screening, and likelihood of minimal harms from behavioral interventions.</p>
<h3><strong>USPSTF Assessment</strong></h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes that there is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for ASD in children aged 18 to 30 months for whom no concerns of ASD have been raised. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.</p>",Screening for Autism Spectrum Disorder in Young Children,"Autism Spectrum Disorder in Young Children, Screening, 2016"

The prevalence of amblyopia, strabismus, and anisometropia ranges from 1% to 6% among children younger than 6 years in the United States.1, 3-7 Strabismus is the most common cause of amblyopia among children younger than 3 years; among children aged 3 to 6 years, strabismus and anisometropia contribute equally.18 Studies show that screening rates among children vary by race/ethnicity and family income.1, 29 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data from 2009–2010 reported identical screening rates among black non-Hispanic children and white non-Hispanic children (80.7%); however, Hispanic children were less likely than non-Hispanic children to report vision screening (69.8%). Children whose families earned 200% or more above the federal poverty level were more likely to report vision screening than families with lower incomes.1, 29
Among children younger than 6 years, 4% have myopia (nearsightedness, ie, visual images focus in front of the retina) and up to 20% have hyperopia (farsightedness, ie, visual images focus behind the retina). Among preschool-aged children, 5% to 10% have astigmatism.1, 19-21 Amblyopia may significantly increase the risk of severe vision abnormalities or vision loss in the nonamblyopic eye.1, 30, 31 The estimated lifetime risk of vision loss in persons with amblyopia is 1.2% or greater.1, 30, 31
Scope of Review
The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review1 to update its 2011 recommendation32 on screening for amblyopia and its risk factors in children. The review examined the evidence on the accuracy of vision screening tests to detect amblyopia, its risk factors, or both and the benefits and harms of vision screening and treatment. Surgical interventions for refractory strabismus, cataracts, ptosis, or other conditions were considered to be out of scope for this review. General eye examination to detect ocular abnormalities not typically detected by vision screening was also considered to be out of scope for this review.
Accuracy of Screening Tests
The USPSTF found 34 fair-quality studies (n=45,588 observations) that assessed the accuracy of various screening tests: visual acuity tests (6 studies), stereoacuity tests (4 studies), ocular alignment tests (1 study), combinations of clinical tests (4 studies), autorefractors (16 studies), photoscreeners (11 studies), and retinal birefringence scanning (1 study).1
Fourteen studies recruited participants from ophthalmology clinics and 17 studies recruited from Head Start, community, or school settings; 2 studies were conducted in primary care settings, and 1 study did not report its setting. Across the studies, screening was administered by diverse personnel such as pediatricians, orthoptists, ophthalmologists, nurses, and Head Start staff.1
More than half of the studies (19 studies) were conducted in the United States. The remaining studies took place in Canada (5 studies), Europe (7 studies), and New Zealand or Australia (3 studies). Study sample sizes ranged from 63 to 4040 participants. The age of study participants ranged from 6 months to 6 years. About one-third of study participants were younger than 3 years; most were 3 years and older.1 Many of the studies evaluating photoscreeners (n=6187 observations) included children younger than 3 years; 5 of the 16 studies evaluating autorefractors (n=16,712 observations) included children younger than 3 years.1
The Vision in Preschoolers (VIP) study (n ≤4040) provided data for several publications. The VIP study evaluated the accuracy of multiple screening tests for a wide range of vision conditions. It preferentially enrolled children aged 3 to 5 years from Head Start with amblyopia, amblyopia risk factors, reduced visual acuity, or strabismus.1, 33 Phase 1 of the study compared the accuracy of 11 screening tests.33 Testing was conducted in specially equipped vans that provided a standard environment with minimal distractions. Phase 2 of the study compared screening performed by nurses vs lay staff and focused on 4 of the 11 screening tests.34 The VIP study evaluated the accuracy of screening for a broader range of vision conditions than most other studies, including significant nonamblyogenic refractive error.
Visual Acuity Tests
Six fair-quality studies evaluated visual acuity tests (Lea Symbols or HOTV). Three publications from the VIP study (n=6019) assessed the accuracy of Lea Symbols for identifying amblyopia risk factors or clinically significant nonamblyogenic refractive error.1 In phase 1 of the VIP study, visual acuity testing with Lea Symbols was associated with a positive likelihood ratio (LR) of 6.1 (95% CI, 4.8 to 7.6)33 for detecting amblyopia risk factors or significant nonamblyogenic refractive error; among the 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old age groups, it ranged from 5.95 to 7.39.1 The overall negative LR was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.38 to 0.50); among the 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old age groups, it ranged from 0.39 to 0.47. In phase 2 of the VIP study, positive LRs were 4.9 (95% CI, 4.0 to 6.0) and 3.7 (95% CI, 3.0 to 4.7) for screening performed by nurse and lay staff, respectively. Negative LRs were 0.57 (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.62) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.76), respectively.1, 34
Three additional studies (n=773) assessed the accuracy of Lea Symbols for detecting amblyopia risk factors, significant refractive error, or astigmatism. Positive LRs ranged from 1.6 to 5.7 and negative LRs ranged from 0.05 to 0.21.1
The VIP study (n=3121) found that the HOTV test was associated with an overall positive LR of 4.9 (95% CI, 3.9 to 6.1) for detecting amblyopia risk factors or significant nonamblyogenic refractive error.1, 33 Among the 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old age groups, positive LRs ranged from 3.76 to 6.83.1 Overall, the negative LR was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.46 to 0.58); among the 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old age groups, it ranged from 0.47 to 0.62.1, 33
Stereoacuity Tests
Four fair-quality studies (n=7801) evaluated stereoacuity tests.1 Most of the studies reported positive LRs ranging from 3.6 to 4.9. Negative LRs were in the minimal range for detecting amblyopia risk factors or significant nonamblyogenic refractive error and in the moderate range for detecting refractive error or strabismus.1
Ocular Alignment Tests
In phase 1 of the VIP study (n=3121), the cover-uncover test was associated with a positive LR of 7.9 (95% CI, 4.6 to 14.0) and a negative LR of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.85).1, 33
Combinations of Clinical Tests
Four fair-quality studies (n=1854) assessed combinations of tests of visual acuity, stereoacuity, and ocular alignment.1 Three of the 4 studies reported positive LRs ranging from 12 to 17.1 The fourth study, which reported a smaller positive LR of 4.8 (95% CI, 2.8 to 8.4), was the smallest (n=141) of the studies. The 4 studies reported negative LRs ranging from 0.10 to 0.91.1
Autorefractors
Sixteen fair-quality studies (16,712 observations; n=80 to 4040) evaluated autorefractors.1 Most studies reported moderate positive LRs and small negative LRs; some studies reported large positive LRs and negative LRs.1 Five of the 16 studies evaluating autorefractors enrolled children younger than 3 years.
Photoscreeners
Eleven fair-quality studies (6187 observations; n=63 to 3121) assessed photoscreeners. Generally, most studies reported moderate positive LRs and small negative LRs.1 Many of the studies evaluating photoscreeners enrolled children younger than 3 years.
Retinal Birefringence Scanning
One fair-quality study (n=102) evaluated the Pediatric Vision Scanner (REBIScan). The positive LR was 10.4 (95% CI, 5.6 to 19.4) and the negative LR was 0.0.1
Direct Comparisons of Different Screening Tests
Phase 1 of the VIP study compared 11 screening tests among children aged 3 to 5 years. The Lea Symbols and HOTV visual acuity tests and the Retinomax (Nikon), SureSight (Welch Allyn), and Power Refractor (Plusoptix) autorefractors had higher sensitivity for identifying any visual condition compared with the Random Dot E stereoacuity test (StereoOptical), Randot Stereo Smile Test II (StereoOptical), iScreen photoscreener (iScreen), and MTI photoscreener (Medical Technologies). However, LRs were similar. Positive LRs were generally in the moderate range and negative LRs were in the small to minimal range, with overlapping confidence intervals.1, 33
Age and Testability
Five studies evaluated whether the accuracy of different screening tests (including visual acuity tests, a combination of clinical tests, an autorefractor, and 2 photoscreeners) varies by age.1 Data were limited and estimates were imprecise. Most studies of test accuracy (n=45,588 observations) did not enroll children younger than 3 years. Accuracy did not clearly differ among preschool-aged children by age group.1
Testability (the ability to complete the screening test) may limit the usefulness of some clinical screening tests in children younger than 3 years. Testability was reported in many of the included studies; however, few reported data stratified by age or for children younger than 3 years. Testability generally exceeded 80% to 90% in children aged 3 years, with small increases through age 5 years. Studies that evaluated testability found better testability rates in older children (≥3 years); visual acuity and stereoacuity tests had low testability rates in children younger than 3 years.1 Some data suggest that photoscreeners have high testability rates in children as young as 1 year.1 The VIP study found testability rates near 100% (in children aged ≥3 years) for autorefractors and photoscreeners.1, 33
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment
No eligible randomized clinical trials directly compared screening vs no screening. No available studies evaluated school performance, other functional outcomes, or quality of life. No eligible studies evaluated atropine eye drops or vision therapy.1
The USPSTF evaluated 2 fair-quality studies; a nested, randomized trial within a population-based cohort study (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children [ALSPAC]) and the ALSPAC cohort study. The study assessed prevalence of amblyopia at age 7.5 years (using visual acuity testing); school performance, function, or quality of life outcomes were not evaluated.1, 35, 36 The ALSPAC nested trial (n=3490) compared earlier, more intensive screening (at ages 8, 12, 18, 25, 31, and 37 months) vs 1-time screening at age 37 months.1, 35 Periodic screening (including clinical examination, a visual acuity test, and the cover-uncover test) from ages 8 to 37 months was associated with a 1% decrease in the prevalence of amblyopia at age 7.5 years compared with 1-time screening at age 37 months; however, the difference was only statistically significant for 1 of 2 definitions of amblyopia (interocular difference in acuity ≥0.2 logMAR [logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution], 1.5% vs 2.7%; relative risk, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.29 to 1.04]; and interocular difference in acuity ≥0.3 logMAR, 0.6% vs 1.8%; relative risk, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.15 to 0.86]).1, 35 The ALSPAC cohort study (n=6081) compared screening at age 37 months vs no screening and found no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of amblyopia at age 7.5 years for 3 definitions of amblyopia.1, 36
ALSPAC had several limitations. A major limitation was the high overall attrition rate (about 55%) in both studies. Additional limitations included inadequate randomization and the inability to parse out the effects of earlier screening vs repeated screening. As a result, the USPSTF did not consider ALSPAC to be adequate direct evidence.1, 35, 36
One fair-quality trial and 2 good-quality trials (n=417) of older preschool-aged children (mean age, 4 to 5 years) assessed the benefits of eye patching for the treatment of amblyopia or its risk factors.1, 37-39 There were no trials in children younger than 3 years. Two trials compared patching vs no patching (children were pretreated with eyeglasses if indicated in both groups).1, 38, 39 One trial compared patching plus eyeglasses vs eyeglasses alone vs no treatment.1, 37-39 Study sample sizes ranged from 60 to 180 participants.1 One of the 3 trials (evaluating patching plus eyeglasses vs eyeglasses alone vs no treatment) enrolled screen-detected children.1, 37 Treatment duration was 5 weeks, 12 weeks, and 1 year; follow-up duration was 1 year, 12 weeks, and 1.5 years, respectively.1, 37 Trials were conducted in the United States or the United Kingdom.1, 37-39 The trials reported best corrected visual acuity and improvement in visual acuity (secondary outcome).1, 37-39 Results could not be pooled, due to differences in study populations (eg, eligibility criteria and baseline visual acuity), outcome measures, comparisons, and length of follow-up.1
Patching improved visual acuity in the amblyopic eye by an average of less than 1 line on the Snellen chart after 5 to 12 weeks among children with amblyopia risk factors who were pretreated with eyeglasses.1 More children treated with patching experienced improvement of at least 2 lines on the Snellen chart than did children with no patching (45% vs 21%; p=0.003). Patching plus eyeglasses improved visual acuity by about 1 line on the logMAR chart after 1 year (0.11 logMAR [95% CI, 0.05 to 0.17]) among children with amblyopia risk factors not pretreated with eyeglasses.1 Eyeglasses alone improved visual acuity by less than 1 line on the logMAR chart after 1 year (0.08 logMAR [95% CI, 0.02 to 0.15]) among children with amblyopia risk factors. Benefits were greater for children with more severe vision impairment at baseline. Children with worse baseline visual acuity had greater improvement with patching plus eyeglasses or eyeglasses alone.1
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
Potential harms of vision screening in preschool-aged children include psychosocial effects such as labeling and anxiety, unnecessary referrals due to false-positive results, overdiagnosis, and unnecessary use of corrective lenses or treatments to prevent amblyopia. Studies of screening test accuracy (n=9723) found higher false-positive rates (usually >75%) in populations with a lower prevalence (<10%) of vision abnormalities, whereas studies in populations with a higher prevalence of vision abnormalities found lower false-positive rates (usually <35%).1 No studies reported measures of psychosocial distress, labeling, or anxiety. The ALSPAC prospective cohort study (n=4473) evaluated bullying behaviors among 8-year-olds in a subgroup of children treated with eye patching. The likelihood of experiencing bullying behaviors was lower among patched children offered screening at age 37 months than among those not screened (25.7% vs 47.1%; p=0.033; adjusted odds ratio, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.16 to 0.92]).1, 36
Potential harms of treatment include loss of visual acuity in the amblyopic eye, psychological harms (eg, effects on child happiness, behavioral problems, and parental concern or upset), inverse amblyopia, and patch allergy. One fair-quality trial and 2 good-quality trials (n=417) assessed treatment harms1, 37-40 and did not report similar outcomes. There were no trials in children younger than 3 years. None of the included studies evaluated treatment with atropine eye drops. One trial compared patching (n=87) vs no patching (n=93) and found that worsening visual acuity in the nonamblyopic eye did not differ between groups at 5 weeks (2.4% vs 6.8%; p=0.28).1, 38 One trial compared patching plus eyeglasses (n=59) vs eyeglasses alone (n=59) vs no treatment (n=59) and found no significant difference in loss of visual acuity in the amblyopic eye among treatment groups at 1 year.1, 37 In a subanalysis of 1 trial (patching plus eyeglasses vs eyeglasses alone vs no treatment), the psychological harms of treatment were evaluated in 144 of 177 study participants.1, 37, 40 Few differences in child happiness or behavioral problems were observed between the treatment groups. More children were upset about treatment with patching than with eyeglasses alone (85% vs 29% at age 4 years; p=0.03; 62% vs 26% at age 5 years; p=0.005).1, 40 The study did not compare the eyeglasses and patching group with the nontreatment group for the psychological harms identified.1, 40 No participants experienced an adverse event (eg, inverse amblyopia or patch allergy) in 1 trial (n=60) comparing patching vs no patching.1, 39
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF found adequate evidence that vision screening tools are accurate in detecting vision abnormalities. Accuracy did not clearly differ among preschool-aged children by age group. Treatment of amblyopia is associated with moderate improvements in visual acuity in children aged 3 to 5 years, which are likely to result in permanent improvements throughout life. The USPSTF concluded that the benefits are moderate because untreated amblyopia results in permanent, uncorrectable vision loss, and the benefits of screening and treatment can be experienced over a child’s lifetime. The USPSTF found adequate evidence on harms of screening (ie, higher false-positive rates in low-prevalence populations). The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the potential harms of treatment as small. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the overall net benefit is moderate for children aged 3 to 5 years.
Trials that examined the benefits and harms of treatment did not enroll children younger than 3 years. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that treatment of amblyopia or its risk factors in children younger than 3 years leads to improved vision outcomes or other benefits. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of treatment in children younger than 3 years. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the benefits of screening to detect amblyopia or its risk factors in children younger than 3 years are uncertain, and that the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined for this age group.
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
Amblyopia is a functional reduction in visual acuity characterized by abnormal processing of visual images by the brain. It is associated with conditions that affect binocular vision, such as strabismus, anisometropia, and media opacity. The loss in visual acuity is unlikely to resolve spontaneously if left untreated. Therefore, screening in preschool-aged children seems to be consistent with the current biological understanding of amblyopia and the importance of detecting it during a critical period in children’s development.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from February 28 to March 27, 2017. Some comments expressed concern about the scope of the review for screening. The USPSTF added language to clarify that the general eye examination to detect ocular abnormalities was not in scope for this review, and further clarified the language about screening tests in the Clinical Considerations section. Other comments expressed concern about the lack of information on health disparities. In response, the USPSTF added language about health disparities to the Clinical Considerations section. Some comments did not agree with delaying screening until the age of 3 years. The USPSTF added more language about the lack of evidence regarding screening and treatment in children younger than 3 years to the Discussion section. Last, some comments requested information about the effects of screening on learning and quality of life outcomes. The USPSTF revised the Research Needs and Gaps section, which discusses these gaps in the evidence on outcomes.","<h3 style=""padding: 1em 0em 0.2em; margin: 0em; color: #222222; font-size: 1.2em; font-style: oblique; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Importance</h3>

Regardless of ECG findings, persons who are already at high risk of CVD events should receive intensive risk factor modification.

The Pooled Cohort Equations, introduced by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association in 2013, include the same variables as the Framingham Risk Score as well as race/ethnicity and diabetes. Persons with a 10-year CVD event risk less than 7.5% are considered at low risk, and those with a 10-year CVD event risk of 7.5% or greater are considered at elevated risk.<sup style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;""><a style=""padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.1em; margin: 0em; color: #0072bc; text-decoration-line: none;"" href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-risk-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation6"">6</a></sup>&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that clinicians use the Pooled Cohort Equations to assess CVD risk.</p>

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">Both resting and exercise ECG are used for the diagnostic evaluation of suspected CVD, which has led to the suggestion that ECG could also be used to screen asymptomatic persons to identify those who would benefit from earlier, more intensive management of modifiable risk factors, preventive interventions, or both. Resting ECG records cardiac electrical activity while the patient is at rest, over a short period of time. Standard ECG testing is performed with 12 leads, although some tests use fewer leads. More recently, ECG leads have been built into blood pressure cuffs, smartphones, and other devices. Exercise ECG records cardiac electrical activity during physical exertion, often at a prespecified intensity level. The most common method of exercise ECG is the treadmill test, but other methods, such as those using bicycles and ergometers, have also been used. Both resting and exercise ECG look for markers of previous myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, and other cardiac abnormalities (such as left ventricular hypertrophy, bundle branch block, or arrhythmia) that may be associated with CVD or predict future CVD events.</p>

Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death among adults in the United States, accounting for 1 in 3 deaths. Although CVD remains a significant cause of illness and death, mortality from CVD has been decreasing over time in the United States. Currently, the annual incidence of new cases of myocardial infarction and cerebral vascular accident in the United States is 580,000 and 610,000, respectively.16
Scope of Review
In 2012, the USPSTF recommended against screening for coronary heart disease with ECG in low-risk adults (D recommendation) and issued an I statement for intermediate- and high-risk adults.17 To update the prior recommendations, the USPSTF requested the current evidence review.18, 19 In recognition of how the field has advanced, the current evidence review did not include association studies but addressed whether the addition of screening with resting or exercise ECG improves health outcomes compared with traditional CVD risk assessment in asymptomatic adults.
Accuracy of Screening Tests
The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on whether screening with resting or exercise ECG improves calibration, discrimination, or risk reclassification when added to CVD risk assessment models using traditional risk factors. The USPSTF focused on evidence that ECG adds to current CVD risk assessment with the Framingham Risk Score or the Pooled Cohort Equations, because this could lead to change in treatments for patients.
The USPSTF identified 5 cohort studies (2 of which overlap with the previous review) that evaluated whether adding exercise ECG to current CVD risk assessment models improves calibration, discrimination, or reclassification. Four studies assessed whether exercise ECG improved calibration; 2 studies evaluated adding exercise ECG to the Framingham Risk Score,20, 21 and the other 2 studies evaluated adding exercise ECG to other risk assessment models.22, 23 The studies used different measures and showed mixed effects on calibration. Three studies assessed whether adding exercise ECG to the Framingham Risk Score21 or other risk assessment models22, 24 improved discrimination, and all found only small absolute improvements in area under the curve or C statistic (0.02 to 0.03). Only 1 risk assessment model development study evaluated whether adding exercise ECG improved risk reclassification. However, the study did not apply risk thresholds that currently determine treatment and only reported overall reclassification, not event and nonevent net reclassification.22
The USPSTF identified 9 cohort studies (1 of which overlapped with the previous review) that evaluated whether adding resting ECG to current CVD risk assessment models improves calibration, discrimination, or reclassification; 5 of these studies evaluated multiple ECG changes and 4 evaluated a single ECG change. Five studies evaluated adding resting ECG to the Framingham Risk Score,25-29 and 1 of these studies29 also evaluated adding resting ECG to the Pooled Cohort Equations. Adding resting ECG to existing CVD risk assessment models improved calibration for several CVD outcomes, although the strength of evidence was low and resulted in small or very small improvements in discrimination (absolute improvement in area under the curve or C statistic, 0.001 to 0.050). Two studies reported net reclassification when resting ECG was added to the Framingham Risk Score,18, 26, 27 and 1 study29 evaluated adding resting ECG to both the Framingham Risk Score and the Pooled Cohort Equations. There was a small to moderate improvement in reclassification but the studies did not present the full reclassification data, so it is difficult to determine whether the reclassification would change treatment. No 2 studies evaluated the same CVD risk assessment model, risk category threshold, or outcome.
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment
The USPSTF identified no studies that directly assessed whether adding resting ECG to current CVD risk assessment models improves cardiovascular outcomes for any risk group.18, 19 The USPSTF identified 2 fair-quality randomized clinical trials of screening with exercise ECG in persons with diabetes (and therefore at increased risk of CVD) that found no difference in mortality or cardiovascular events.1, 2 However, both trials fell far short of their intended enrollment and therefore were underpowered and had a relatively short time period (mean, 3.5 years) to detect a difference in cardiovascular outcomes.
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
Resting ECG has the potential for anxiety and labeling; however, the USPSTF was unable to find relevant studies on these harms. Exercise ECG has more potential for direct harms (eg, triggering a cardiovascular event or musculoskeletal injury), but survey data of symptomatic patients suggests that these harms are very rare.30, 31 The primary concern for both types of ECG screening is the harm of subsequent procedures or interventions initiated as a result of screening (eg, angiography or revascularization procedures). Only 1 study reported harms of subsequent testing (1/12 patients referred for revascularization had a nonfatal myocardial infarction);2 therefore, the USPSTF included a broader range of study designs in its evaluation to estimate potential harms.
Angiography rates after screening with exercise ECG in asymptomatic populations are generally less than 3% (range, 0.6% to 13%). The majority of patients undergoing angiography in these studies did not have angiographically demonstrable coronary artery stenosis, but some did undergo revascularization (0.1% to 0.5%).18 Based on large population-based registries that include symptomatic persons, angiography is associated with a serious harm rate of 1.7%, including arrhythmia (0.40%), death (0.10%), stroke (0.07%), and myocardial infarction (0.05%). Revascularization increases the risk of periprocedural myocardial infarction (1.7%), coronary artery dissection (1.3%), bleeding events within 72 hours (1.3%), vascular complications (0.4%), renal failure (0.4%), stroke (0.1%), and death on day of procedure (<0.01%).18 The USPSTF did not find any recent studies that directly address the potential harms of anxiety or labeling.
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
For asymptomatic adults at low risk of CVD events (defined as 10-year CVD event risk <10%), it is very unlikely that the information from resting or exercise ECG (beyond that obtained with conventional CVD risk factors) will result in a change in the patient's risk category that would lead to a change in treatment and ultimately improve health outcomes. Serious possible harms are associated with screening with resting or exercise ECG, specifically the potential adverse effects of subsequent invasive testing. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening with ECG in asymptomatic adults at low risk of CVD events has no net benefit.
For asymptomatic adults at intermediate or high risk of CVD events (defined as a 10-year CVD event risk of 10% to 20% or >20%, respectively), there is insufficient evidence to determine the extent to which information from resting or exercise ECG adds to current CVD risk assessment models (ie, Pooled Cohort Equations) and whether it results in a change in risk management and ultimately reduces CVD events. As with low-risk adults, serious possible harms are associated with screening with resting or exercise ECG in asymptomatic adults at intermediate or high risk of CVD events. The USPSTF concludes that there is insufficient evidence to estimate the net benefit of screening with ECG in asymptomatic adults at intermediate or high risk of CVD events.
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
There is substantial and consistent evidence that identifying and treating traditional, modifiable CVD risk factors such as high blood pressure, abnormal lipid levels, diabetes, current smoking, physical inactivity, and diet improve cardiovascular outcomes. These risk factors are linked to the biological understanding of the pathophysiology of CVD. Electrocardiography measures the electrical activity in the heart and results can be abnormal for many reasons, only some of which are attributable to atherosclerotic CVD. In low-risk patients, these abnormalities are unlikely to result from atherosclerotic CVD; in intermediate- and high-risk patients, they are more likely to result from atherosclerotic CVD, but there is no evidence that targeting these abnormalities in addition to modifiable risk factors has benefit.

A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from December 19, 2017, to January 22, 2018. In response to public comments, the USPSTF clarified the definition of CVD and the preferred CVD risk assessment tool.","<h3 style=""padding: 1em 0em 0.2em; margin: 0em; color: #222222; font-size: 1.2em; font-style: oblique; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Importance</h3>

If existing CVD risk assessment tools could be improved, treatment might be better targeted, thereby maximizing the benefits of and minimizing the harms of screening.</p>

"<p><b>Patient Population Under Consideration</b></p>
<p>This recommendation applies to all pregnant women.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Screening Intervals</b></p>
<p>All pregnant women should be tested for syphilis as early as possible when they first present to care. If a woman has not received prenatal care prior to delivery, she should be tested at the time she presents for delivery. In most cases of congenital syphilis, pregnant women received prenatal care but were not screened and treated for syphilis early enough during the pregnancy to prevent transmission to the fetus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The USPSTF found no new studies that examined the effectiveness of repeated testing for syphilis during pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)5 and joint guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)6 endorse repeat screening. Specifically, these groups recommend that women at high risk for syphilis be rescreened early in the third trimester (at approximately 28 weeks of gestation) and again at delivery. Women at high risk for syphilis infection include those living in communities or geographic areas with higher prevalence of syphilis, those living with HIV, and those with a history of incarceration or commercial sex work.7 AAP and ACOG also recommend repeat screening after exposure to an infected partner.6 Clinicians should be aware of the prevalence of syphilis infection in the communities they serve.7 Most states mandate screening for syphilis in all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit, and some mandate screening at the time of delivery.8</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Screening Tests</b></p>
<p>Syphilis infection is caused by the Treponema pallidum bacteria. Current screening tests for syphilis rely on detection of antibodies to the infection rather than direct detection of the bacteria. Screening for syphilis infection is a 2-step process. Traditionally, screening involved an initial &ldquo;nontreponemal&rdquo; antibody test (ie, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test or rapid plasma reagin [RPR] test) to detect biomarkers released from damage caused by syphilis infection, followed by a confirmatory &ldquo;treponemal&rdquo; antibody detection test (ie, fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption or T pallidum particle agglutination test). Because nontreponemal tests are complex, a reverse sequence screening algorithm has been developed in which an automated treponemal test (such as an enzyme-linked, chemiluminescence, or multiplex flow immunoassay) is performed first, followed by a nontreponemal test. If the test results of the reverse sequence algorithm are discordant, a second treponemal test (preferably using a different treponemal antibody) is performed. The USPSTF found no studies comparing the false-positive rate of the traditional screening algorithm with that of the reverse sequence screening algorithm among pregnant women. The CDC has provided more detailed guidance on testing for and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis.9</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Treatment</b></p>
<p>In 2015, the CDC recommended parenteral benzathine penicillin G for the treatment of syphilis in pregnant women.5 Evidence on the efficacy or safety of alternative antibiotic medications for pregnant women and the fetus is very limited; therefore, women who report a penicillin allergy should be evaluated and, if found allergic, desensitized and treated with penicillin. Because the CDC updates its recommendations regularly, clinicians are encouraged to consult the CDC website for the most up-to-date information.9</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Additional Approaches to Prevention</b></p>
<p>Trends in congenital syphilis incidence rates are closely related to trends in primary and secondary syphilis infection rates among all women. Screening for syphilis in nonpregnant populations is an important public health approach to preventing the sexual transmission of syphilis and subsequent vertical transmission of congenital syphilis. The USPSTF recommends screening for syphilis in nonpregnant adolescents and adults at increased risk for infection.10</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Useful Resources</b></p>
<p>The USPSTF has made recommendations on screening for other sexually transmitted infections, including chlamydia and gonorrhea,11 hepatitis B virus,12 genital herpes,13 and HIV.14 National-, state-, and county-level data on syphilis infection rates are also available from the CDC.2</p>",,200,"<p><b>Other Considerations: Research Needs and Gaps</b></p>
<p>Although the benefits of screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women to prevent congenital syphilis are well established, additional studies on the use of different screening algorithms in pregnant women, as well as studies to help identify optimal rescreening intervals and populations to rescreen during pregnancy, could help inform implementation of screening programs. Studies on treatment options besides penicillin could also be helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Reaffirmation of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</b></p>
<p>This recommendation is a reaffirmation of the USPSTF 2009 recommendation statement.3 In 2009, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women and found that the benefits of screening substantially outweighed the harms.22 For the current recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a targeted review16 to look for substantial new evidence on the benefits and harms of screening and determined that the net benefit of screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women continues to be well established. The USPSTF found no new substantial evidence that could change its recommendation and, therefore, reaffirms its recommendation to screen for syphilis infection in all pregnant women.</p>
<p><b>Recommendations of Others</b></p>
<p>This recommendation statement is consistent with those of other professional and public health organizations. The CDC recommends screening for syphilis infection in all pregnant women at their first prenatal visit.5 Joint guidelines from AAP and ACOG recommend screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women as early as possible in pregnancy.6 The CDC, AAP, and ACOG also recommend repeat screening at 28 weeks of gestation and again at delivery in high-risk women. Women at high risk for syphilis infection include those living in high-prevalence communities, those living with HIV, and those with a history of incarceration or commercial sex work.10 AAP and ACOG also recommend repeat screening after exposure to an infected partner.6 The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends screening for syphilis infection in all pregnant women.29</p>",,"<p><b>Importance</b></p>
<p>Syphilis is an infection that is primarily sexually transmitted. Untreated syphilis infection in pregnant women can also be transmitted to the fetus (congenital syphilis) at any time during pregnancy or at birth. Congenital syphilis is associated with stillbirth, neonatal death, and significant morbidity in infants (eg, bone deformities and neurologic impairment).1 After a steady decline from 2008 to 2012, cases of congenital syphilis markedly increased from 2012 to 2016, from 8.4 to 15.7 cases per 100,000 live births (an increase of 87%).2 At the same time, national rates of syphilis increased among women of reproductive age.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Reaffirmation</b></p>
<p>In 2009, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women and issued an A recommendation.3 The USPSTF has decided to use a reaffirmation deliberation process to update this recommendation. The USPSTF uses the reaffirmation process for well-established, evidence-based standards of practice in current primary care practice for which only a very high level of evidence would justify a change in the grade of the recommendation.4 In its deliberation of the evidence, the USPSTF considers whether the new evidence is of sufficient strength and quality to change its previous conclusions about the evidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Detection</b></p>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening tests can accurately detect syphilis infection in pregnant women.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Benefits of Detection and Early Treatment</b></p>
<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that early universal screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women reduces the incidence of congenital syphilis and the adverse outcomes of pregnancy associated with maternal infection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Harms of Detection and Early Treatment</b></p>
<p>Screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women may result in potential harms, including false-positive results that require clinical evaluation, anxiety, and harms of treatment with antibiotic medications. However, the USPSTF concluded that these harms of screening are no greater than small.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women who are not known to have a high-risk hereditary cancer syndrome. A hereditary cancer syndrome occurs when a genetic mutation is passed from parent to child that increases risk for developing cancers or can cause earlier onset of cancers. Women who have a hereditary cancer syndrome that puts them at high risk for ovarian cancer are excluded from this recommendation.</p>
<h3>Risk Assessment</h3>
<p>Women with certain hereditary cancer syndromes are at high risk for ovarian cancer. For example, women with <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> genetic mutations associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer are at high risk for ovarian cancer. Numerous genetic mutations and hereditary cancer syndromes may be associated with ovarian cancer, each with a different constellation of associated cancers and family history pattern.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation3""><span style=""font-size: small;"">3-5</span></a></sup> Women with a family history of ovarian or breast cancer may be at risk for a hereditary cancer syndrome and should discuss their family history with their health care professional. Management of a diagnosed hereditary cancer syndrome and prevention of ovarian cancer in these women is beyond the scope of this recommendation statement.</p>
<p>The clinical symptoms of ovarian cancer (eg, abdominal pain or pressure, bloating, constipation, urinary symptoms, back pain, or fatigue) are nonspecific and may be present in both healthy women and women with late-stage ovarian cancer; therefore, use of clinical symptoms for risk stratification for the early detection of disease is difficult.</p>
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
<p>The USPSTF does not recommend routine screening for ovarian cancer using any method. Transvaginal ultrasound and serum CA-125 testing are readily available procedures that are commonly used to evaluate women with signs or symptoms of ovarian cancer, and both have been evaluated in screening studies. Pelvic examination is also commonly performed to evaluate women with lower abdominal symptoms, and although many clinicians perceive that pelvic examination with bimanual palpation of the ovaries is useful for screening for ovarian cancer,<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation6""><span style=""font-size: small;"">6</span></a></sup> there is a lack of evidence to support this.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation7""><span style=""font-size: small;"">7</span></a></sup> Furthermore, the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial included bimanual palpation of the ovaries in its initial screening protocol, but this screening component was discontinued 5 years into the study because no cases of ovarian cancer were detected solely with bimanual palpation of the ovaries.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation8""><span style=""font-size: small;"">8</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation9"">9</a></sup></span></p>
<p>The evaluation of abnormal test results consists of repeat testing with the same or a different test and often surgical removal (by laparoscopy or laparotomy) of 1 or both of the ovaries and fallopian tubes to determine whether a woman has ovarian cancer. Diagnostic guidelines recommend surgical removal of the complete ovary or ovaries, rather than tissue biopsy, to determine whether ovarian cancer is present.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Treatment of ovarian cancer typically includes surgical treatment (staging or debulking) and intraperitoneal, intravenous, or combined chemotherapy.</p>
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
<p>In a separate recommendation statement, the USPSTF recommends that women with a family history indicating they are at risk for a deleterious gene mutation (<em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em>) be referred for genetic counseling and, if indicated, genetic testing.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation10""><span style=""font-size: small;"">10</span></a></sup> The National Cancer Institute provides additional information on ovarian cancer risk and hereditary cancer syndromes.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation11""><span style=""font-size: small;"">11</span></a></sup> The USPSTF also concluded in a separate recommendation statement that the current evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening with pelvic examination to detect a range of gynecologic conditions in asymptomatic, nonpregnant women.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation7""><span style=""font-size: small;"">7</span></a></sup></p>",,189,"<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
<p>Given that most cases of ovarian cancer are diagnosed at later stages, when associated mortality is high, further research is needed to identify new screening strategies that could accurately detect ovarian cancer early, at a point when outcomes could be improved. There is a need for more sensitive and specific serologic tests, as well as better imaging techniques. Because of the potential for serious harms from diagnostic workup of positive screening results (ie, surgical removal of the ovary to determine whether ovarian cancer is present), new screening strategies should minimize false-positive results and be highly specific. In addition, studies evaluating the benefits and harms of these screening strategies in asymptomatic women not at high risk for ovarian cancer are needed. Study outcomes should include ovarian cancer mortality, quality of life, false-positive rate, surgery rate, surgical complication rate, and psychological harms. Further research is also needed on primary prevention of ovarian cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation of Others</strong></p>
<p>There is consensus among major medical and public health organizations that screening for ovarian cancer in the general population is not recommended. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not recommend screening for ovarian cancer in low-risk, asymptomatic women; evaluation of high-risk women may include transvaginal ultrasound and CA-125 testing, in addition to physical examination.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation22""><span style=""font-size: small;"">22</span></a></sup> The American Cancer Society states that there is no screening test proven to be effective and sufficiently accurate in the early detection of ovarian cancer and does not recommend screening for ovarian cancer in average-risk women.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation23""><span style=""font-size: small;"">23</span></a></sup> The American College of Radiology does not recommend screening for ovarian cancer in average-risk women.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation24""><span style=""font-size: small;"">24</span></a></sup> Consistent with the USPSTF, the American Academy of Family Physicians recommends against screening for ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation25""><span style=""font-size: small;"">25</span></a></sup> Although it is beyond the scope of the USPSTF recommendation, other organizations, such as the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, have issued guidelines for the prevention of ovarian cancer in women with hereditary cancer syndromes.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation26""><span style=""font-size: small;"">26</span></a></sup></p>

Based on United States Cancer Statistics data on invasive cancer rates from 2010 to 2014, the average annual age-adjusted incidence of ovarian cancer was 11.4 cases per 100,000 women per year, with a mortality rate of 7.4 deaths per 100,000 women.1 In 2017, it is estimated that 22,440 new cases of ovarian cancer will have been diagnosed in the United States and 14,080 deaths will have occurred.12 Early stages of the disease are often asymptomatic. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and can include abdominal pain or pressure, bloating, constipation, urinary symptoms, back pain, or fatigue.13 The majority of women (88%) diagnosed with ovarian cancer are 45 years and older, with a median age at diagnosis of 63 years.2 Most women with ovarian cancer are diagnosed at later stages; approximately 60% of women have distant spread of disease at the time of diagnosis.2 From 2010 to 2014, white women had the highest age-adjusted incidence rate (11.8 cases per 100,000 women), followed by Hispanic women (10.3 cases per 100,000 women), black women (9.2 cases per 100,000 women), Asian/Pacific Islander women (9.1 cases per 100,000 women), and American Indian/Alaska Native women (8.3 cases per 100,000 women). White women are most likely to die of ovarian cancer, followed by black, Hispanic, American Indian/Alaska Native women, and Asian/Pacific Islander women.1
Mortality rates from ovarian cancer vary by stage at diagnosis; 5-year survival rates range from 92.5% for localized cancer to 28.9% for cancer with distant spread.14
Scope of Review
The USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on screening for ovarian cancer to update its 2012 recommendation. The evidence review evaluated the benefits and harms of screening for ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women not known to be at high risk for ovarian cancer. Outcomes of interest included ovarian cancer mortality, quality of life, false-positive rate, surgery and surgical complication rates, and psychological effects of screening. The USPSTF included primary peritoneal cancer in its ascertainment of ovarian cancer outcomes, even if it was not the primary end point of the study, because clinically, both types of cancer are diagnosed and treated as 1 disease. The USPSTF also considered ascertainment of ovarian cancer outcomes that included both incident and prevalent cases of cancer, since screening programs would detect both. The review included any screening approach evaluated by clinical trial design. The USPSTF considered the initial screening test (eg, transvaginal ultrasound or CA-125 testing interpreted using a single cutoff or the risk of ovarian cancer algorithm [ROCA; Abcodia Inc]) as the screening intervention. Further testing that subsequently occurred based on initial screening test results was considered follow-up testing and evaluation, rather than part of screening.
Effectiveness of Screening
The USPSTF reviewed direct evidence evaluating the benefits of screening for ovarian cancer on mortality.3 The USPSTF identified 3 good-quality studies evaluating the effect of annual screening in asymptomatic women not known to be at high risk for ovarian cancer. None of the studies found that screening significantly reduced ovarian cancer mortality. The largest and most recent trial, the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS), was a randomized clinical trial of 202,638 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 74 years not known to be at high risk for ovarian cancer.15 More than 95% of trial participants were white, and 1.6% reported a maternal history of ovarian cancer and 6.4% reported a maternal history of breast cancer; however, women with a family history considered “high risk” for familial ovarian cancer were explicitly excluded.16 The UKCTOCS trial had 2 intervention groups and a no-screening control group. Women were randomized to screening with CA-125 serum testing, with triage and follow-up determined by ROCA, or to yearly transvaginal ultrasound. The CA-125 ROCA screening intervention group was described as multimodal screening in the trial publications and included a standard protocol for all additional evaluation. ROCA evaluates changes in CA-125 values over time, following a baseline age-adjusted measurement. Women randomized to the control group received no screening. After a median follow-up of 11.1 years, ovarian cancer mortality (which includes mortality from primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancer) was not significantly different among the control group and 2 intervention groupss (0.35% in the control group, 0.32% in the transvaginal ultrasound group, and 0.32% in the CA-125 ROCA group). There was also no significant difference in mortality risk in the transvaginal ultrasound and CA-125 ROCA groups (hazard ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.76 to 1.09] and 0.89 [95% CI, 0.74 to 1.08], respectively).3, 15 Exploratory analyses of UKCTOCS trial data suggest the potential for emergence of a delayed mortality benefit of screening appearing beyond 10 years from randomization. However, this finding was not statistically significant unless cases of primary peritoneal cancer were excluded. Extended follow-up data may help clarify this potential finding in the future; however, given the aggressive nature (ie, low 5-year survival rate) of ovarian cancer, the mechanism behind a delayed benefit from screening and early detection would be unclear, especially because the trial discontinued screening after 7 to 11 years.
The pilot trial for the UKCTOCS trial, UK Pilot, was much smaller (n = 21,955 randomized). It evaluated the use of a single cutoff value for CA-125 testing and found no significant difference in ovarian cancer mortality (excluding cases of primary peritoneal cancer, which were not reported) between women who were screened vs not screened (0.08% vs 0.16%; relative risk, 0.5 [95% CI, 0.22 to 1.11]).3, 17
The only trial conducted in the United States was the PLCO trial. In that trial, 68,557 women who had at least 1 ovary at baseline were randomized to either annual screening (both CA-125 testing and transvaginal ultrasound for the first 4 rounds of screening, then 2 rounds of CA-125 testing only) or usual care; median follow-up was 12.4 years. Eligible participants were women aged 55 to 74 years without a previous diagnosis of lung, colorectal, or ovarian cancer. Trial recruitment targeted women from the general population; the trial did not actively exclude women based on risk for hereditary ovarian cancer syndromes (based on reported family history), and 17.4% of participants reported a family history of ovarian or breast cancer. Nearly 90% of participants were white. Abnormal test results were managed by the participant's personal health care practitioner. No difference was found in ovarian cancer mortality, which includes primary peritoneal cancer mortality, with 0.34% in the screening group and 0.29% in the usual care group (relative risk, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.82 to 1.71]).3, 8 Recent analyses of PLCO trial data that add up to 6 more years of posttrial mortality data also did not find evidence of a longer-term benefit of screening.18
Potential Harms of Screening
The USPSTF reviewed evidence on harms of screening for ovarian cancer from the 3 studies described above, as well as a fourth study of fair quality reporting on quality of life and psychological harms of screening (Quality of life, Education, and Screening Trial [QUEST]) (n = 549 analyzed).19 Based on data from the 3 studies, the calculated false-positive rates (ie, the number of women without cancer who had a positive screening test result) were 11.9% in the first screening round in the UKCTOCS transvaginal ultrasound group and 9.0% in the first screening round in the UKCTOCS CA-125 ROCA group.3 These rates exclude cases of primary peritoneal cancer because this information was not reported. Cumulatively, in all subsequent screening rounds (ie, rounds 2 to 11) in the UKCTOCS CA-125 ROCA group, 44.2% of women who did not have ovarian cancer (including primary peritoneal cancer) had a positive CA-125 ROCA result at some point during the trial screening period.3 The false-positive rate for subsequent screening rounds in the UKCTOCS transvaginal ultrasound group was not reported. In the UK Pilot trial, the calculated false-positive rate (excluding cases of primary peritoneal cancer, which were not reported) of CA-125 testing using a single cutoff value was 4.2% across 3 screening rounds. In the PLCO trial, the calculated false-positive rate (including cases of primary peritoneal cancer) of transvaginal ultrasound and CA-125 testing was 9.6% across all 6 screening rounds.3 Surgery to investigate positive screening test results among women who ultimately did not have ovarian cancer occurred in 0.2% of participants in the UK Pilot CA-125 group, 0.97% of participants in the UKCTOCS CA-125 ROCA group, 3.25% of participants in the UKCTOCS ultrasound group, and 3.17% of participants in the PLCO CA-125 plus ultrasound group.3 Up to 15% of these women had major surgical complications.3
The USPSTF identified limited evidence on the psychological harms of screening for ovarian cancer from the UKCTOCS and QUEST trials.3, 19, 20 The UKCTOCS trial measured anxiety in a subgroup of participants. Although no significant differences were found between the intervention and control groups, there was a greater odds of psychological morbidity among women who were referred to higher levels of screening.20 The QUEST trial evaluated the effect of screening for ovarian cancer on cancer worry and quality of life among average-risk US women 30 years and older. Cancer screening consisted of alternating CA-125 testing and transvaginal ultrasound every 6 months, for a maximum of 4 screening rounds. Although no statistically significant difference in cancer worry was found between study groups, the trial found that women with abnormal test results were more likely to report cancer worry at 2 years of follow-up (odds ratio, 2.8 [95% CI, 1.1 to 7.2]) than women without abnormal results.19
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for ovarian cancer does not reduce ovarian cancer mortality. Three large good-quality studies all found no benefit in ovarian cancer mortality from annual screening in asymptomatic women not known to be at high risk for ovarian cancer. The USPSTF also found adequate evidence from these 3 studies that the harms from screening for ovarian cancer are at least moderate and may be substantial in some cases. Harms from screening for ovarian cancer include false-positive results, which may lead to unnecessary diagnostic surgery to determine whether ovarian cancer is present, often resulting in removal of 1 or both of the ovaries and fallopian tubes. Serious surgical complications can also result. The USPSTF found the evidence on psychological harms of screening to be inadequate and could not draw any definitive conclusion on whether ovarian cancer screening causes psychological harms. Given the lack of mortality benefit of screening, and the moderate to substantial harms that could result from false-positive screening test results and subsequent surgery, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of screening for ovarian cancer with CA-125 testing (using a single cutoff value or the ROCA), transvaginal ultrasound, or both outweigh the benefit, and the net balance of the benefit and harms of screening is negative.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from July 18, 2017, to August 14, 2017. Many comments voiced concern that given the aggressive nature of ovarian cancer and that symptoms often only appear at later stages, any screening test that can detect ovarian cancer early should be recommended. The USPSTF agrees that screening tests are needed that can accurately detect ovarian cancer earlier to prevent deaths from ovarian cancer; however, the evidence shows that currently available tests are not able to do so and can lead to harm by causing healthy women to undergo surgical removal of their ovaries when no cancer is present. The USPSTF issued its recommendation against screening based on this evidence, not on the costs of screening. Additional comments sought clarification on which women are at high risk for ovarian cancer and to whom the recommendation applies. The USPSTF revised the recommendation statement to clarify the role of family history in ovarian cancer risk and to describe symptoms of ovarian cancer. Women with a family history of ovarian or breast cancer or symptoms should discuss this with their health care provider. The USPSTF also provided more information on how it considered evidence from specific studies. The USPSTF considered study results that included cases of primary peritoneal cancer in the ascertainment of ovarian cancer because clinically, both types of cancer are diagnosed and treated as 1 disease. Similarly, the USPSTF considered study results that included reporting of both prevalent and incident cases of ovarian cancer, because screening would detect both.","<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>The age-adjusted incidence of ovarian cancer from 2010 to 2014 was 11.4 cases per 100,000 women per year.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup> Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death among US women and the leading cause of death from gynecologic cancer, despite its low incidence.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup> Approximately 14,000 women die of ovarian cancer each year in the United States. More than 95% of ovarian cancer deaths occur among women 45 years and older.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation2""><span style=""font-size: small;"">2</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>The positive predictive value of screening tests for ovarian cancer is low, and most women with a positive screening test result do not have ovarian cancer (ie, many women without ovarian cancer will have a false-positive result on screening tests).</p>
<h3>Benefits of Screening</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening with transvaginal ultrasound, testing for the serum tumor marker cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), or a combination of both does not reduce ovarian cancer mortality.</p>
<h3>Harms of Screening</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for ovarian cancer can result in important harms, including many false-positive results, which can lead to unnecessary surgical interventions in women who do not have cancer. Depending on the type of screening test used, the magnitude of harm ranges from moderate to substantial and reflects the risk for unnecessary diagnostic surgery. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the psychological harms of screening for ovarian cancer.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes that there is at least moderate certainty that the harms of screening for ovarian cancer outweigh the benefits.</p>",Screening for Ovarian Cancer,"Ovarian Cancer, Screening, 2018"
"<p><strong>Patient Population Under Consideration</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation statement applies to all asymptomatic individuals with a cervix, regardless of their sexual history. This recommendation statement does not apply to women who have been diagnosed with a high-grade precancerous cervical lesion or cervical cancer, women with in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol, or women who have a compromised immune system (eg, women living with HIV).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of Risk</strong></p>
<p>High-risk HPV infection is associated with nearly all cases of cervical cancer, and women are exposed to hrHPV through sexual intercourse. Although a large proportion of HPV infections resolve spontaneously, the high likelihood of exposure to hrHPV means that women are at risk for precancerous lesions and cervical cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certain risk factors increase risk for cervical cancer, including HIV infection, a compromised immune system, in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol, and previous treatment of a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer. Women with these risk factors are not included in this recommendation and should receive individualized follow-up. Women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix and do not have a history of a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer are not at risk for cervical cancer and should not be screened. As part of the clinical evaluation, clinicians should confirm through review of surgical records or direct examination that the cervix was removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Screening Tests</strong></p>
<p>Current evidence indicates that there are no clinically important differences between liquid-based cytology and conventional cytology. A variety of platforms are used to detect hrHPV; most use either signal or nucleic acid amplification methods. Published trials of hrHPV testing used in situ hybridization, polymerase chain reaction, and hybrid capture technology to test for HPV strains associated with cervical cancer. hrHPV testing has been used for primary screening, cotesting with cytology, and follow-up testing of positive cytology results (reflex hrHPV).2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Screening with cytology alone, hrHPV testing alone, and both in combination offer a reasonable balance between benefits and harms for women aged 30 to 65 years; women in this age group should discuss with their health care professional which testing strategy is best for them. Evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and decision modeling studies suggest that screening with cytology alone is slightly less sensitive for detecting CIN 2 and CIN 3 than screening with hrHPV testing alone. Although screening with hrHPV testing alone or in combination with cytology detects more cases of CIN 2 and CIN 3, this method results in more diagnostic colposcopies for each case detected.2-5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a number of different protocols for triage of abnormal results from screening with cytology, hrHPV testing, or cotesting. Clinical trial evidence and modeling suggest that different triage protocols have generally similar detection rates for CIN 2 and CIN 3; however, proceeding directly to diagnostic colposcopy without additional triage leads to a much greater number of colposcopies compared with using other triage protocols. Maintaining comparable benefits and harms of screening with cytology alone or hrHPV testing alone requires that patients, clinicians, and health care organizations adhere to currently recommended protocols for repeat testing, diagnostic colposcopy, and treatment.6, 7</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Timing of Screening</strong></p>
<p><strong>Women Younger Than 21 Years</strong></p>
<p>Cervical cancer is rare before age 21 years.8 Exposure of cervical cells to hrHPV during vaginal intercourse may lead to cervical carcinogenesis, but the process has multiple steps, involves regression, and is generally not rapid. Because of the slow progression of disease and the high likelihood of regression in this age group, evidence suggests that screening earlier than age 21 years, regardless of sexual history, would lead to more harm than benefit. Treatment of CIN 2 or CIN 3 among women younger than 21 years may increase risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes.2, 8</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Women Older Than 65 Years</strong></p>
<p>Joint guidelines from the American Cancer Society, American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, and American Society for Clinical Pathology (ACS/ASCCP/ASCP) define adequate prior screening as 3 consecutive negative cytology results or 2 consecutive negative cotesting results within 10 years before stopping screening, with the most recent test occurring within 5 years.6 The guidelines further state that routine screening should continue for at least 20 years after spontaneous regression or appropriate management of a precancerous lesion, even if this extends screening past age 65 years. Once screening has stopped, it should not resume in women older than 65 years, even if they report having a new sexual partner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Women Older Than 65 Years Who Have Not Been Adequately Screened</strong></p>
<p>Screening may be clinically indicated in older women with an inadequate or unknown screening history. Recent data suggest that one-fourth of women aged 45 to 64 years have not been screened for cervical cancer in the preceding 3 years.9 In particular, women with limited access to care, women from racial/ethnic minority groups, and women from countries where screening is not available may be less likely to meet criteria for adequate prior screening. Certain considerations may also support screening in women older than 65 years who are otherwise at high risk (ie, women with a history of high-grade precancerous lesions or cervical cancer, in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol, or a compromised immune system).2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Screening Interval</strong></p>
<p>Screening more frequently than every 3 years with cytology alone confers little additional benefit, with a large increase in harms, including additional procedures and assessment and treatment of transient lesions. Treatment of lesions that would otherwise resolve on their own is harmful because it can lead to procedures with unwanted adverse effects, including the potential for cervical incompetence and preterm labor during pregnancy. Evidence from RCTs, observational studies, and modeling studies suggest that a 5-year screening interval for primary hrHPV testing alone or cotesting offers the best balance of benefits and harms. Screening more frequently than every 5 years with primary hrHPV testing alone or cotesting does not substantially improve benefit but significantly increases the number of screening tests and colposcopies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Screening aims to identify high-grade precancerous cervical lesions to prevent progression to cervical cancer. High-grade cervical lesions may be treated with excisional and ablative therapies. Early-stage cervical cancer may be treated with surgery (hysterectomy) or chemotherapy. Treatment of precancerous lesions is less invasive than treatment of cancer.2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Race/Ethnicity, Geography, and Cervical Cancer</strong></p>
<p>The incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer remain relatively high among certain populations. The overall mortality rate from cervical cancer among African American women is 10.1 deaths per 100,000 women,10 which is more than twice the rate among white women (when adjusted for hysterectomy rate), although the gap has narrowed over time. Mortality is higher among older African American women. Several studies have found that African American women are screened for cervical cancer at rates similar to those for white women and that inadequate follow-up after screening and differences in treatment may be important contributing factors. The higher mortality rate in African American women may also be attributable, in part, to the higher than average rate of adenocarcinoma, which carries a worse prognosis than the most common type of cervical cancer (squamous cell carcinoma).10-12</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>American Indian/Alaska Native women also have higher rates of cervical cancer mortality (3.2 deaths per 100,000 women) than the US average.10 Factors driving this higher rate may include lower screening rates (16.5% of American Indian/Alaska Native women in the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System reported not receiving a Papanicolaou [Pap] test in the past 5 years)13 and inadequate follow-up.2 Hispanic women have a significantly higher incidence rate of cervical cancer and slightly higher mortality rate (2.6 deaths per 100,000 women [unadjusted for hysterectomy rate]), with especially high rates occurring along the Texas-Mexico border. Although white women overall have the lowest mortality rate from cervical cancer, white women living in geographically isolated and medically underserved areas (particularly Appalachia) have much higher mortality rates than the US average. Asian women also have lower screening rates, especially those who have recently immigrated to the United States and may have language or cultural barriers to screening.10</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to race/ethnicity and geography, insurance coverage plays an important role in access to cervical cancer screening; 23.1% of women without health insurance and 25.5% of women with no regular health care clinician reported not receiving a Pap test in the past 5 years, compared with 11.4% of the general population. Insurance status may interact with other demographic factors, such as race/ethnicity and age, to increase disparities.13 In addition, there are no screening data for women with disabilities and those who identify as lesbian or transgender.14-16</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Progress in reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality has been uneven. The most important factors contributing to higher incidence and mortality rates include financial, geographic, and language or cultural barriers to screening; barriers to follow-up; unequal treatment; and difference in cancer types, all of which vary across subpopulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Additional Approaches to Prevention</strong></p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&rsquo;s Advisory Council on Immunization Practice recommends routine HPV vaccination. A 2-dose schedule is recommended for girls and boys who initiate the vaccination series at ages 9 to 14 years. Three doses are recommended for girls and boys who initiate the vaccination series at ages 15 to 26 years and for those who have a compromised immune system.17 The overall effect of HPV vaccination on high-grade precancerous cervical lesions and cervical cancer is not yet known. Current trials have not yet provided data on long-term efficacy; therefore, the possibility that vaccination might reduce the need for screening with cytology or hrHPV testing is not established. Given these uncertainties, women who have been vaccinated should continue to be screened as recommended until further evidence accrues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Useful Resources</strong></p>
<p>The 2012 ACS/ASCCP/ASCP guidelines6 and 2015 interim guidance from the ASCCP and the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO)7 provide algorithms for follow-up of abnormal screening results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America have issued recommendations on screening for and management of cervical cancer in patients living with HIV.18</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute provides strategies for reducing cervical cancer mortality in its report &ldquo;Excess Cervical Cancer Mortality: A Marker for Low Access to Health Care in Poor Communities.&rdquo;19</p>",,199,"<p><strong>Other Considerations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>
<p>Participation in regular screening has a far greater effect on cervical cancer morbidity and mortality than which of the 3 recommended screening strategies is chosen for women ages 30 to 65 years. Implementation should therefore focus on ensuring that women receive adequate screening, regardless of which strategy is used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although low screening rates contribute to high mortality rates in certain underserved populations, screening alone is not sufficient to reduce cervical cancer morbidity and mortality and related disparities. Loss to follow-up and disparities in treatment are also contributing factors. Therefore, having systems in place to ensure follow-up of abnormal results, appropriate treatment of any pathology, and support to retain patients throughout the entirety of cancer treatment are important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Research Needs and Gaps</strong></p>
<p>Regular screening for prevention of cervical cancer is highly effective, whether it is with cervical cytology alone, hrHPV testing alone, or both in combination. To further reduce the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer, it is necessary to find effective strategies to reach inadequately screened and unscreened women and to address follow-up and treatment issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research is needed to evaluate whether different screening strategies could play a part in reducing mortality rates, as well as ways to improve follow-up for current screening strategies and to ensure equitable access to treatment across populations. In addition, research is needed to determine whether screening after age 65 years has a different balance of benefits and harms in different subpopulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike cytology, samples for hrHPV testing have the potential to be collected by the patient and mailed to health programs for analysis, meaning self-collection may be one strategy for increasing screening rates among populations where they are currently low. Rigorous comparative studies are needed to verify this hypothesis and to identify effective strategies for implementation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another important area for future research is the effect of HPV vaccination, because an increasing number of women and men of screening age are being vaccinated. Decreases in hrHPV type prevalence due to vaccination could reduce the positive predictive value of hrHPV testing, which, along with potential reductions in cancer incidence, may increase the number of false-positive results and, therefore, the balance of benefits and harms. In either case, screening strategies may need to be adjusted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation replaces the 2012 USPSTF recommendation. The major change in the current recommendation is that the USPSTF now recommends screening every 5 years with hrHPV testing alone as an alternative to screening every 3 years with cytology alone among women aged 30 to 65 years. These are the 2 preferred screening strategies based on the USPSTF review of trial, cohort, and modeling results. Cotesting as an alternative strategy has demonstrated similar effectiveness, although it may result in more tests and procedures compared with either cytology or hrHPV testing alone. As in the 2012 recommendation, the USPSTF continues to recommend against screening in women younger than 21 years, in women older than 65 years who have had adequate prior screening and are not otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer, and in women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix and do not have a history of a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations of Others</strong></p>
<p>The ACS/ASCCP/ASCP recommend that women aged 21 to 29 years be screened every 3 years with cytology alone (cervical cytology or Pap testing). Women aged 30 to 65 years should be screened every 5 years with cytology and HPV testing (cotesting) or every 3 years with cytology alone. Women at increased risk of cervical cancer (ie, women with a history of cervical cancer, a compromised immune system, or diethylstilbestrol exposure) may need to be screened more often. Women who have had CIN 2+ should continue screening for 20 years after the last abnormal test result, even if it extends screening beyond age 65 years.6 The ASCCP and SGO issued interim guidance in 2015 that recommended primary HPV screening starting at age 25 years as an alternative to cytology alone or cotesting.7 The American Academy of Family Physicians guidelines are in agreement with the USPSTF.65 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stated in 2016 that cytology alone and cotesting are still specifically recommended in current guidelines from most major societies; however, primary HPV screening in women 25 years or older can be considered as an alternative to current cytology-based screening if performed per ASCCP and SGO interim guidance.66 The Panel on Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents has issued guidance on screening for and management of HPV in patients living with HIV.18</p>",,"<p><strong>Importance</strong></p>
<p>The number of deaths from cervical cancer in the United States have decreased substantially since the implementation of widespread cervical cancer screening and continue to decline, from 2.8 per 100,000 women in 2000 to 2.3 deaths per 100,000 women in 2015.1 Most cases of cervical cancer occur among women who have not been adequately screened.2 Strategies that aim to ensure that all women are appropriately screened and receive adequate follow-up are most likely to succeed in further reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality in the United States.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Detection</strong></p>
<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening with cervical cytology alone, primary testing for high-risk HPV types (hrHPV testing) alone, or in combination at the same time (cotesting) can detect high-grade precancerous cervical lesions and cervical cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>USPSTF Assessment</strong></p>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the benefits of screening every 3 years with cytology alone in women aged 21 to 29 years substantially outweigh the harms. The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the benefits of screening every 3 years with cytology alone, every 5 years with hrHPV testing alone, or in combination in women aged 30 to 65 years outweigh the harms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the benefits of screening in women older than 65 years who have had adequate prior screening and are not otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer do not outweigh the potential harms.</p>

"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic children and adolescents aged 10 to 18 years. This recommendation does not apply to children and adolescents presenting for evaluation of back pain, breathing difficulties, abnormal radiography findings or other imaging studies, or obvious deformities in spinal curvature.</p>
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
<p>Most screening tests for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis are noninvasive. Screening is usually done by visual inspection of the spine to look for asymmetry of the shoulders, shoulder blades, and hips. In the United States, the forward bend test is commonly used to screen for idiopathic scoliosis. First, a clinician visually inspects the spine of a patient while the patient is standing upright. Next, the patient stands with feet together and bends forward at the waist with arms hanging and palms touching. The clinician repeats the visual inspection of the spine.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation4"">4</a></sup></span> A scoliometer, which measures the angle of trunk rotation, may be used during the forward bend test. An angle of trunk rotation of 5&deg; to 7&deg; is often the threshold for referral for radiography.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup> Other screening tests include a humpometer, the plumb line test, and Moir&eacute; topography (creating a 3-dimensional image of the surface of a patient&rsquo;s back) (<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#tab"">Table</a>).</p>
<p>If idiopathic scoliosis is suspected, radiography is used to confirm the diagnosis and to quantify the degree of curvature (ie, the Cobb angle) and the Risser sign (the stage of ossification of the iliac apophysis).<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup> US organizations that advocate screening recommend the forward bend test combined with scoliometer measurement.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>The goal of treatment is to decrease or stop progression of spinal curvature during the period of adolescent growth prior to skeletal maturity. Treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is determined by the degree of spinal curvature and the potential for further growth and generally includes observation, bracing, surgery, and exercise.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
<p>Most children and adolescents with scoliosis do not have symptoms. Generally, smaller spinal curvatures remain stable, while larger curvatures tend to progress in severity.</p>
<p>Pulmonary dysfunction can be clinically significant in patients with spinal curvatures greater than 100&deg;; however, curvatures of that severity are rare. Back pain is more common, but its effect on functioning or disability is unclear.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup> Current evidence suggests that the presence of back pain does not necessarily correlate with the degree of spinal curvature in adulthood. Adults with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis may have poor self-reported health, appearance, and social interactions. Mortality is similar to that among unaffected adults.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup></p>
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
<p>Evidence on the harms of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is limited. False-positive results are an important potential harm, with rates ranging from 0.8% to 21.5%.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation5"">5</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation6"">6</a></sup></span> However, the direct harms of screening are unclear.

<h4>Current Practice</h4>
<p>Various organizations have recommended routine screening for scoliosis in children and adolescents since the 1980s.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation4"">4</a></sup></span> More than half of US states either mandate or recommend school-based screening for scoliosis.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation4"">4</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation7"">7</a></sup></span> Children and adolescents are usually screened with the forward bend test, with or without scoliometer measurement.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation4"">4</a></sup></span></p>
<p>In general, patients with a Cobb angle of less than 20&deg; are observed without treatment; however, exercise may be recommended at this time. Patients with a Cobb angle greater than 30&deg; or a Cobb angle of 20&deg; to 30&deg; that progresses 5&deg; or more over 3 to 6 months are treated with bracing. Patients with a Cobb angle of 40&deg; to 50&deg; may be treated with bracing or surgery, while those with a Cobb angle greater than 50&deg; typically require surgery.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup></p>",,187,"<h3>Other Considerations</h3>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
<p>The USPSTF identified several research gaps. Prospective, controlled screening studies that allow for comparison of screened and nonscreened populations and different screening settings, personnel, and procedures are needed. Good-quality studies with prospective identification of cohorts at the time of diagnosis (eg, from geographical areas with and without routine screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis) or treatment (eg, treated vs observed cohorts) for the purpose of long-term follow-up are important. High-quality studies on the potential harms of screening and treatment are also needed. Additional studies to help determine whether individual characteristics (eg, body mass index) may influence response to bracing treatment would be helpful. Studies on long-term outcomes are needed and should stratify results by degree of spinal curvature at diagnosis and at skeletal maturity. Better information on long-term outcomes such as pulmonary disorders, disability, back pain, psychological effects, cosmetic issues, and quality of life would be helpful. Good-quality studies on treatment with exercise, bracing, and surgery among screen-detected patients are needed. Studies conducted in primary care settings are also needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations of Others</strong></p>
<p>Several national specialty groups have published statements in support of screening. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, the Scoliosis Research Society, the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America, and the American Academy of Pediatrics advocate screening for scoliosis in girls at 10 and 12 years and once in male adolescents at 13 or 14 years as part of medical home preventive services, if screening is performed by well-trained screening personnel.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation26""><span style=""font-size: small;"">26</span></a></sup> The UK National Screening Society does not recommend screening for scoliosis, given the uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness of screening and treatment.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation27""><span style=""font-size: small;"">27</span></a></sup> However, the International Society on Scoliosis Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treatment recommends screening for idiopathic scoliosis through school-based programs, and that screening should be performed by clinicians who specialize in spinal deformities.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation28""><span style=""font-size: small;"">28</span></a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><sup><span style=""font-size: small;"">Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</span></sup></strong></p>
<p>This recommendation updates the 2004 USPSTF recommendation, in which the USPSTF recommended against routine screening for idiopathic scoliosis in asymptomatic adolescents (D recommendation).<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation8""><span style=""font-size: small;"">8</span></a></sup> In 2004, the USPSTF found fair evidence that treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis leads to health benefits (ie, decreased pain and disability) in a small proportion of persons. The USPSTF bounded the harms of treatment as moderate (eg, unnecessary brace wear or unnecessary referral to specialty care). Therefore, at that time, the USPSTF concluded that the harms of screening exceeded the potential benefits.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation8""><span style=""font-size: small;"">8</span></a></sup></p>
<p>To update its recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review of the evidence. Because of new research, the USPSTF determined that it no longer has moderate certainty that the harms of treatment outweigh the benefits. The USPSTF found no direct evidence of a benefit of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis on health outcomes. A growing body of evidence suggests that brace treatment can interrupt or slow scoliosis progression; however, evidence on whether reducing spinal curvature in adolescence has a long-term effect on health in adulthood is inadequate. Evidence on the effects of exercise and surgery on health or spinal curvature in childhood or adulthood is insufficient. Although the USPSTF previously found that treatment has moderate harms, a change in the analytic framework, outcomes, and applicability of older evidence resulted in the USPSTF assessing the evidence on harms of treatment as inadequate. As a result, the USPSTF has determined that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, leading the USPSTF to issue an I statement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>","Burden of Disease
The prevalence of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (defined as a Cobb angle ≥10°) ranges from 1% to 3% among children and adolescents aged 10 to 16 years.1, 2 Cumulative incidence estimates for spinal curvature of greater severity are 1.0% (Cobb angle ≥20°) and 0.4% (Cobb angle ≥40°). Prevalence varies by sex, ranging from 0.15% to 0.66% in boys and from 0.24% to 3.10% in girls.1 Prevalence of scoliosis with a Cobb angle of 10° is similar among girls and boys, but girls are 10 times more likely than boys to progress to a Cobb angle of 30° or greater. Girls are also 5 times more likely than boys to have a Cobb angle of 20° or greater.1 The adverse effects of progressive scoliosis vary depending on its severity and include treatment costs, cosmetic deformity, reduced quality of life, disability, chronic back pain, social and psychological effects, functional limitations, and pulmonary disorders.1
Scope of Review
To update its 2004 recommendation, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.8
Accuracy of Screening Tests
Seven fair-quality observational studies assessed screening in adolescents (n=447,243).1 Four studies evaluated the forward bend test with scoliometer measurement, 1 study evaluated the forward bend test with scoliometer measurement and Moiré topography, 1 study evaluated screening with a series of single, independent tests (forward bend test ,Moiré topography, scoliometer, or humpometer), and 1 study evaluated the forward bend test with a level plane and ruler. Studies were conducted in 7 different international sites, including 1 in the United States. Other countries included Singapore, Hong Kong, Greece, Ireland, and Norway. Six studies were conducted in school-based settings.1 There was heterogeneity in the screening approaches, screening procedures, and training of the screeners (eg, orthopedists, nurses, and physical education teachers). Studies provided a limited description of screening populations and subgroups; 3 studies had follow-up data on children who screened negative. Five studies reported results of a single screening episode; 2 studies reported cumulative results of multiple years of repeated screening.1 Studies used a Cobb angle of 10° or greater of the major spinal curvature as the threshold for a diagnosis of scoliosis.1
Screening accuracy improved with the number of CI screening tests used. Sensitivity and positive predictive value of screening programs varied based on whether a single or multiple screening tests were used and by the selected threshold for a positive screening result.
Sensitivity and Specificity
Screening with a combination of the forward bend test, scoliometer measurement, and Moiré topography had the highest sensitivity (93.8% [95% CI, 93.3% to 94.3%]) and specificity (99.2% [95% CI, 99.2% to 99.2%]).9-11 The forward bend test combined with scoliometer measurement had lower screening accuracy (71.1% sensitivity [95% CI, 54.1% to 84.6%] and 97.1% specificity [95% CI, 96.3% to 97.7%]).5 The forward bend test alone had 84.4% sensitivity (95% CI, 67.2% to 94.7%) and 95.2% specificity (95% CI, 94.3% to 95.9%), the humpometer had 93.8% sensitivity (95% CI, 79.2% to 99.2%) and 78.5% specificity (95% CI, 76.9% to 80.0%), the scoliometer had 90.6% sensitivity (95% CI, 75.0% to 98.0%) and 80.7% specificity (95% CI, 79.1% to 82.1%), and Moiré topography had 100% sensitivity (95% CI, 84.2% to 100%) and 85.4% specificity (95% CI, 84.0% to 86.7%).6
False-Positive and False-Negative Results
One study evaluated screening with a combination of the forward bend test, scoliometer measurement, and Moiré topography and reported a low false-negative rate (6.2%) and the lowest false-positive rate (0.8%).1, 6, 11 One study of the forward bend test combined with scoliometer measurement reported a 2.9% false-positive rate and a 28.9% false-negative rate.5 Single screening tests were associated with the highest false-positive rates (forward bend test, 4.8% [15.6% false-negative rate]; scoliometer, 19.3% [9.4% false-negative rate]; Moiré topography, 14.6% [0% false-negative rate]; humpometer, 21.5% [6.3% false-negative rate]).1, 6
Positive Predictive Value
Screening with a combination of the forward bend test, scoliometer measurement, and Moiré topography had the highest positive predictive value (81.0% [95% CI, 80.3% to 81.7%]).9-11 Positive predictive values for the forward bend test combined with scoliometer measurement ranged from 29.3% (95% CI, 20.3% to 39.8%)5 to 54.1% (95% CI, 40.8% to 66.9%)12-14 and from 5.0% (95% CI, 3.4% to 7.0%) to 17.3% (95% CI, 11.7% to 24.2%) for a single screening test (ie, humpometer or the forward bend test alone).1, 6
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment
Bracing
The USPSTF found 7 studies on the effectiveness of treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Five studies (n=651) evaluated the effectiveness of 3 different types of braces. The 5 studies included 3 trials (1 fair-quality randomized clinical trial [RCT] and 1 fair-quality and 1 good-quality prospective controlled clinical trial [CCT] [n=347])15-18 and 2 observational studies (1 good-quality prospective observational study and 1 fair-quality retrospective observational study [n=304]).19, 20 Two trials were stopped early for observation of benefit. The good-quality prospective CCT began as an RCT but was changed to a patient preference controlled trial to boost enrollment after low acceptance of random assignment.1, 17, 18
Studies included a comparison group that originally was not treated with bracing and had a prespecified clinical threshold for initiation of treatment. Three studies enrolled participants who had not previously received treatment for scoliosis; 2 studies did not provide details on prior treatment. Study sample sizes ranged from 37 to 242 participants. Studies were conducted in 5 countries (Canada, Sweden, United Kingdom, Ireland, and United States).1
Study participants were recruited from specialty orthopedic centers and school screening programs. Average age at study enrollment was 12 to 13 years. Race/ethnicity was inconsistently reported; in the 1 trial in which it was reported, 78% of participants were white. Most participants were female. Study participants had various types of scoliotic curvatures; curvature severity varied from a Cobb angle of about 20° to 30°. Eighty-five percent of participants had not reached skeletal maturity (defined as a Risser sign of 0 to 2).1
Three controlled prospective studies (n=345) suggested a benefit of treatment with bracing on slowing curvature progression of 5° or 6° compared with observed controls;3, 15, 16, 19 1 prospective study (n=37) and 1 retrospective study (n=64) showed limited differences in curvature progression of 10° or more between treatment groups and observation control groups.3, 14, 16 Four studies (n=411) evaluated curvature progression to a degree considered to be failure of treatment.11, 16, 20, 21 The largest of these studies (n=242) demonstrated a significant benefit associated with bracing.17, 18 The RCT (n=68) suggested less curvature progression in the treatment group but the significance was not reported.3, 15 Two smaller studies (n=101) found similar results between treated and control populations.3, 12, 16
The aforementioned large study (n=242) was a good-quality, international CCT (Bracing in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Trial [BrAIST]) that evaluated the effectiveness of bracing for 18 hours per day.18 The study included a randomized cohort (n=116) and a preference cohort (n=126). The study conducted intention-to-treat and as-treated analyses. The rate of treatment success in the as-treated analysis (which included both cohorts) was 72% in the intervention group and 48% in the control group (odds ratio, 1.93 [95% CI, 1.08 to 3.46]).1, 3, 18 In the intention-to-treat analysis (which included the randomized cohort only), the rate of treatment success was 75% in the intervention group and 42% in the control group (odds ratio, 4.11 [95% CI, 1.85 to 9.16]).1, 3, 18 The number needed to treat to prevent 1 case of curvature progression past 50° was 3.0 (95% CI, 2.0 to 6.2), and the reduction in relative risk with bracing was 56% (95% CI, 26 to 82).1, 3, 18 BrAIST was the only study that reported quality-of-life outcomes associated with bracing; outcomes were similar between treatment groups.
One study, the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) bracing cohort, assessed Cobb angle in adulthood.19, 20 Of the original 106 participants enrolled at 2 centers in the SRS bracing cohort, 77 were re-evaluated as adults (mean age, 32 years). The study demonstrated that the average Cobb angle at skeletal maturity was similar in the observed and treated groups (30.6° vs 27.7°, respectively; P=0.067). At follow-up in adulthood, the average Cobb angle had increased by an average of 4.4° (SD, 4.1°) in observed participants and by 6.4° (SD, 5.8°) in treated participants. Only 7.5% of observed participants and 5.4% of treated participants had curvature progression past 45° at the time of follow-up (P >0.99).1, 3
Exercise
Two Italian trials (n=184) evaluated the effectiveness of exercise treatment (tailored physiotherapeutic, scoliosis-specific exercise).21, 22 The trials used control groups in which participants were assigned to an exercise program not designed to specifically treat scoliosis. Trial participants had a Cobb angle ranging from 10° to 25°; skeletal maturity ranged from a Risser sign of 0 to 3. Patients were older than 10 years.1
In the good-quality RCT (n=110)21 and the fair-quality CCT (n=74),22 the intervention group showed significant improvement compared with a generic exercise control group at the 12-month follow-up. In the RCT, intervention group participants had a Cobb angle reduction of 4.9°, compared with an increase of 2.8° in the control group (P <0.001).1, 3, 21, 22 Quality-of-life measures improved at 12 months in the intervention group compared with marginal improvements or unchanging measures in the control group. At the end of the 12-month treatment period in the CCT, the intervention group had a decrease of 0.67° in average magnitude of all spinal curvatures compared with an increase of 1.38° in the control group (P <0.05).1, 3, 21, 22
Surgery
The USPSTF found no studies of surgical treatment in screening-relevant populations that met inclusion criteria.
Association Between Adolescent Spinal Curvature Severity and Adult Health Outcomes
The USPSTF found no studies that directly addressed whether changes in the severity of spinal curvature in adolescence results in changes in adult health outcomes. The USPSTF found no studies that reported health outcomes stratified by degree of spinal curvature at skeletal maturity. Two fair-quality studies provided data on adult health outcomes, stratified by the type of treatment received in adolescence.1, 3, 23-25
The USPSTF considered 2 fair-quality retrospective observational long-term follow-up analyses (n=339) of adults diagnosed with idiopathic scoliosis in adolescence.1, 3, 23-25 Adult outcomes were stratified by the type of treatment received in adolescence (bracing or surgery). Quality of life, as measured by the Scoliosis Research Society 22-Item (SRS-22) Patient Questionnaire or the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, was not significantly different between observed and treated participants at follow-up in adulthood. No significant differences were found between braced and surgically treated participants in the Oswestry Disability Index or in general well-being, self-esteem, and social activity. Pulmonary and pregnancy outcomes were not significantly different between braced and surgically treated participants. However, braced participants rated their body appearance as more distorted than did untreated participants and reported more negative treatment experiences than those treated with surgery.1, 3, 23-25
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
The USPSTF found no studies on the direct harms of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. False-positive rates ranged from 0.8% for the forward bend test combined with scoliometer measurement and Moiré topography to 21.5% for hump assessment alone. Potential harms associated with false-positive results include psychological harms, chest radiation, and other harms of unnecessary treatment.
Potential harms of bracing include skin problems, body pain, physical limitations, anxiety, and depression. Complications of surgery include bleeding, infection, nerve damage, and death. The USPSTF found no studies that assessed the harms of treatment with surgery or exercise. Harms of bracing were reported in 1 good-quality study (n=242).17, 18 In this RCT, intervention group participants were more likely to experience skin problems under the brace than control group participants (12/146 vs 0/96, respectively). Intervention group participants more commonly reported nonback body pain than control group participants (12/146 vs 2/96, respectively). The study reported low rates of anxiety and depression. Three of 146 participants in the intervention group reported anxiety and depression, compared with 1 of 96 participants in the control group. One of the intervention group participants reported a serious adverse event (anxiety and depression requiring hospitalization) compared with no participants in the control group. The intervention and control groups had similar rates of abnormal breast development, neurologic symptoms, and gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms.17, 18
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF found no direct evidence on screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and health outcomes. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that currently available screening tests can detect adolescent idiopathic scoliosis but no evidence on the harms of screening. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on treatment with exercise and surgery; it found adequate evidence that treatment with bracing may slow curvature progression in adolescents with mild or moderate curvature severity. However, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the association between reduction in spinal curvature in adolescence and long-term health outcomes in adulthood. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of treatment. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis cannot be determined.
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
Mild or moderate idiopathic scoliosis (ie, Cobb angle of <40° to 50°) is often asymptomatic in adolescence. In addition, the majority of cases of scoliosis will not substantially progress during adolescence. The likelihood of progression in adulthood is small for persons with a spinal curvature of less than 30° at skeletal maturity. However, there is no validated way to easily identify which cases of asymptomatic scoliosis will worsen during adolescence and lead to poor long-term outcomes.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from May 30 to June 26, 2017. Many comments expressed concern about the change in letter grade (from a D grade to an I statement). In response, the USPSTF added language in the ""Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation"" section to explain the change in grade. Some comments sought clarification of who the recommendation applies to. The USPSTF clarified this in the “Patient Population Under Consideration” section. Other comments expressed concern that the evidence needed to change the recommendation grade is unattainable. The USPSTF added language to address this in the “Research Needs and Gaps” section.","<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is a lateral curvature of the spine of unknown cause with a Cobb angle (a measure of the curvature of the spine) of at least 10&deg; that occurs in children and adolescents aged 10 to 18 years. It is the most common form of scoliosis and usually worsens during adolescence before skeletal maturity. In the United States, the estimated prevalence of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis with a Cobb angle of at least 10&deg; among children and adolescents aged 10 to 16 years is 1% to 3%.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation2"">2</a></sup></span> Most patients with a spinal curvature of greater than 40&deg; at skeletal maturity will likely experience curvature progression in adulthood.

<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that currently available screening tests can accurately detect adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The accuracy of screening was highest (93.8% sensitivity and 99.2% specificity) when 3 separate screening tests were used (eg, the forward bend test, scoliometer measurement, and Moir&eacute; topography); sensitivity was lower when screening programs used just 1 or 2 screening tests (eg, 71.1% for the forward bend test and scoliometer measurement and 84.4% for the forward bend test alone).</p>
<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found no direct evidence regarding the effect of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis on patient-centered health outcomes. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the treatment of idiopathic scoliosis (Cobb angle &lt;50&deg; at diagnosis) in adolescents with exercise (2 small studies) or surgery (no studies) or its effects on health outcomes or the degree of spinal curvature in childhood or adulthood. The USPSTF found adequate evidence (5 studies) that treatment with bracing may decrease curvature progression in adolescents with mild or moderate curvature severity (an intermediate outcome). However, it found inadequate evidence on the association between reduction in spinal curvature in adolescence and long-term health outcomes in adulthood.</p>

"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to adults without a history of transient ischemic attack, stroke, or other neurologic signs or symptoms. It was based on evidence of the benefits and harms of screening using ultrasonography to detect narrowing of the carotid arteries. A previous USPSTF review on the assessment of carotid intima&ndash;media thickness in 2009 found insufficient evidence to support its use as a screen for coronary heart disease risk. For this recommendation, the USPSTF did not review new evidence on ultrasonography to characterize carotid plaque structure or intima&ndash;media thickness and their association with cardiovascular disease events. However, clinicians considering using ultrasonography to characterize carotid plaque to stratify patient risk for cardiovascular disease should consider the same harms that the USPSTF evaluated for this recommendation (stroke, myocardial infarction, and death from CEA) because surgery may result from this screen.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
The major risk factors for carotid artery stenosis include older age, male sex, hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, and heart disease. Despite evidence on important risk factors, there are no externally validated, reliable methods to determine who is at increased risk for carotid artery stenosis or for stroke when carotid artery stenosis is present.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Although screening with ultrasonography has few direct harms, all screening strategies, including those with or without confirmatory tests (that is, digital subtraction or magnetic resonance angiography), have imperfect sensitivity and could lead to unnecessary surgery and result in serious harms, including death, stroke, and myocardial infarction. There is no evidence that screening by auscultation of the neck to detect carotid bruits is accurate or provides benefit.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The USPSTF has made recommendations on many factors related to stroke prevention, including screening for hypertension, screening for dyslipidemia, the use of nontraditional coronary heart disease risk factors, counseling on smoking, and counseling on healthful diet and physical activity. In addition, the USPSTF recommends the use of aspirin for persons at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. These recommendations are available on the USPSTF Web site (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>). &nbsp;<a name=""other""></a>
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Valid and reliable tools are needed to determine which persons are at high risk for carotid artery stenosis or for stroke due to carotid artery stenosis and who might experience harm from treatment with CEA or CAAS. Studies comparing CEA or CAAS with current standard medical therapy are needed. The planned CREST-2 (Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial 2) may provide important data for future recommendations. CREST-2 will study 2400 patients with greater than 70% stenosis who are randomly assigned to CAAS with intensive medical management versus intensive medical management alone or to CEA with intensive medical management versus intensive medical management alone.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/cas/casfinalrs.htm#consider,146,"In 2010, the American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association recommended against screening the general population for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. In 2011, the American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Heart Association, in collaboration with several other organizations, including the American Stroke Association, American Association of Neurological Surgeons, American College of Radiology, American Society of Neuroradiology, Society for Vascular Surgery, and Society for Vascular Medicine, recommended against the use of carotid DUS for routine screening of asymptomatic patients with no clinical manifestations of or risk factors for atherosclerosis. The Society for Vascular Surgery also released a guideline in 2011 stating that routine screening to detect clinically asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in the general population is not recommended. The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends against screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in the general adult population.","Burden of Disease

	Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States. Mortality from all strokes has decreased substantially over the past 5 decades; improved blood pressure control is believed to be the most important factor accounting for this decrease 2. Other factors, including treatment and control of diabetes and hyperlipidemia, are also reported to be important contributors. Most strokes are ischemic (80% to 90%), and approximately 10% to 20% are from hemorrhagic causes.

	In a population-based U.S. study from 1999, the age-adjusted incidence rates for ischemic stroke subtypes were 40 per 100,000 persons for stroke due to cardioembolic causes, 27 per 100,000 persons for stroke due to atherostenosis causes, 25 per 100,000 persons for lacunar stroke (small vessel disease), and 52 per 100,000 persons for stroke due to unknown causes 3. Strokes resulting from large artery atherothrombotic disease (such as carotid artery stenosis) in previously asymptomatic patients (the focus of this recommendation) account for a relatively small proportion of all strokes.

	The best available data from U.S.-based studies report that the overall estimated prevalence of carotid artery stenosis (defined as 70% or 75% to 99% stenosis) is 0.5% to 1% 1. Studies have found that the condition is more prevalent in older adults, smokers, persons with hypertension, and persons with heart disease. Evidence shows that the incidence of stroke caused by carotid artery stenosis has been decreasing 1. Research has not shown any single risk factor or clinically useful risk stratification tool that can reliably and accurately distinguish between persons who have clinically important carotid artery stenosis and those who do not.

	Scope of Review

	In 2007, the USPSTF recommended against screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in the general adult population. To update its recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to synthesize the evidence on the accuracy of screening tests, externally validated risk stratification tools, the benefits of treatment of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis with CEA or CAAS, the benefits from medications added to current standard medical therapy, and the harms of screening and treatment with CEA or CAAS.

	Accuracy of Screening Tests

	Three meta-analyses and 3 primary studies assessed the accuracy or reliability of duplex ultrasonography (DUS) to detect carotid artery stenosis 1. A good-quality meta-analysis included studies published from 1966 to 2003 and used digital subtraction angiography as the reference standard 4. Authors reported a sensitivity of 98% (95% CI, 97% to 100%) and a specificity of 88% (CI, 76% to 100%) for detecting carotid artery stenosis of 50% or greater. Sensitivity and specificity for detecting carotid artery stenosis of 70% or greater were 90% (CI, 84% to 94%) and 94% (CI, 88% to 97%), respectively. This evidence is limited by the lack of reporting on whether (or what proportion of) asymptomatic patients were included.

	The reliability of DUS to detect potentially clinically important carotid artery stenosis is limited. A good-quality meta-analysis reported wide variation in measurement properties between laboratories, with clinically important variation in the magnitude of the variation 4. Potential sources of heterogeneity of measurements include differences in patients, study designs, equipment, techniques, and methods of classification or training. One study of 1006 carotid arteries reported poor agreement between readers for the differentiation of stenoses of less than 70% (45% agreement; κ = 0.26 [CI, 0.23 to 0.29]) but excellent agreement for stenoses of 70% or greater (96% agreement; κ = 0.85 [CI, 0.83 to 0.87]) 5. Results of DUS screening can also vary on the basis of the type of scanner, the velocity cut points or ratios used, the Doppler angle employed, and inherent variability between facilities and observers 1 , 6.

	Four studies assessed the use of auscultation for carotid bruits to detect carotid artery stenosis 7–10. Reported sensitivity ranged from 46% to 77%, and specificity ranged from 71% to 98%. However, none of the studies used angiography as a gold standard, and only 2 studies involved patients from the general population.

	No externally validated risk stratification tools can reliably distinguish between persons who have clinically important carotid artery stenosis and those who do not or those who will experience harm after treatment with CEA or CAAS.

	Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment

	There are no studies on the direct benefit of screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. Three randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated the benefit of treating asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis with CEA: ACAS (Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study) 11, VACS (Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study) 12, and ACST (Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial) 13. These RCTs studied 5226 patients randomly assigned to treatment of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis with CEA or medical therapy alone and followed the patients for 2.7 to 9 years. Two of the studies (ACAS and VACS) were conducted in North America, and ACST was conducted in 30 countries, primarily in Europe. The mean age of patients was 65 to 68 years, and they were required to have at least 50% (VACS) or 60% (ACAS and ACST) stenosis of the carotid artery. In the 2 North American trials, most patients (87% to 95%) were white. Two thirds of the patients in ACAS and ACST and all of the patients in VACS were men.

	The evidence has important limitations, including the lack of studies focusing on a population identified by screening in primary care. In addition, many of the enrolled patients were not completely asymptomatic. Although study patients were required to be recently asymptomatic for the carotid artery under study, 20% to 24% had a history of contralateral CEA and 25% to 32% had a history of contralateral transient ischemic attack or stroke in trials reporting baseline data for these characteristics. ACST allowed the enrollment of patients who had a transient ischemic attack or stroke attributable to the carotid artery under study if it occurred more than 6 months before enrollment, and ACAS included patients if their symptoms referable to the contralateral artery occurred more than 45 days before enrollment. Medical therapy varied across trials and was not clearly defined or standardized, although all patients received aspirin in ACAS and VACS. Surgeons were highly selected and were required to submit records of their 50 most recent cases (ACAS and ACST) or previous 24 months performing CEA (VACS); they were selected on the basis of demonstrated low morbidity and mortality rates. In addition, the ACAS and ACST trial protocols did not allow further enrollment of patients by surgeons or institutions that showed unacceptably high morbidity or mortality during the trial.

	In general, the RCTs reported results combining stroke and death outcomes during the perioperative period 30 days after surgery and during the time subsequent to this period. Pooled estimates from the 3 RCTs found that, compared with patients receiving medical treatment alone, 2.0% fewer patients randomly assigned to CEA had perioperative stroke or death and subsequent ipsilateral stroke. Pooled estimates on the outcome of death, perioperative stroke, or any subsequent stroke reported that 3.5% fewer patients treated with CEA had this outcome than those in medical treatment groups 1.

	No studies compared CAAS with medical therapy or studied the incremental benefit of additional medications beyond current standard medical therapy.

	Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment

	No studies examined the direct harms of screening. Although angiography is less commonly used now as a confirmatory test, harms from it occurred in 2 of the previously discussed RCTs. In ACAS, 1.2% of patients (5 of 414) who had angiography developed strokes, and 1 of these patients died. In VACS, 0.4% of patients (3 of 714) had nonfatal strokes after angiography 1.

	The 3 previously discussed RCTs, 8 studies based on additional trials, and 8 cohort studies provided data on harms of treatment. Four of the additional trials include the CASANOVA (Carotid Artery Stenosis with Asymptomatic Narrowing: Operation Versus Aspirin) trial 14, the MACE (Mayo Asymptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy) trial 15, CREST 16 , 17, and the SAPPHIRE (Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy) trial 18. The MACE and CASANOVA trials were conducted in the early 1990s and included 252 patients with 50% to 99% carotid artery stenosis, confirmed by angiography, who were randomly assigned to treatment with CEA. Patients in both trials were predominantly male (56% to 63%); most (60% to 64%) had hypertension, and 42% to 44% had coronary artery disease. Data on harms were provided by 2 other multicenter RCTs (CREST and the SAPPHIRE trial), which compared CEA with CAAS. The SAPPHIRE trial required that participants have at least 1 condition suggesting high surgical risk (for example, age older than 80 years, severe pulmonary disease, or contralateral carotid occlusion). Prevalence of hypertension in CREST and the SAPPHIRE trial was 85% to 88%, prevalence of diabetes in the trials was 25% to 33%, and prevalence of coronary artery disease was 81% in the SAPPHIRE trial and 44% in CREST. In both trials, interventionalists had to demonstrate low complication rates before participating. Eight multicenter cohort studies using Medicare claims and enrollment databases reported perioperative harms of CEA.

	Pooled analysis of data from 6 trials (n = 3435) showed that 2.4% (CI, 1.7% to 3.1%) of patients died or had a stroke in the 30-day period after CEA, which was 1.9% more (CI, 1.2% to 2.6%) than in the medical therapy groups in the 3 trials (n = 5223) directly comparing CEA with medical therapy 1. Pooled data from cohort studies showed a 3.3% rate of death or stroke after CEA at 30 days. One cohort study on harms from CAAS, the CREST lead-in study, found a stroke or death rate of 3.8% (CI, 2.9% to 5.1%) 19. A meta-analysis of 2 trials (n = 6152) found a stroke or death rate of 3.1% (CI, 2.7% to 3.6%) after CAAS 1.

	Other important harms after surgical intervention for carotid artery stenosis include myocardial infarction and surgical complications. In ACST, myocardial infarctions occurred in 0.6% more patients in the CEA group than in the medical group. VACS reported 4 events in the CEA group and none in the medical therapy group. One cohort study of 6 New York hospitals, which included 1378 Medicare beneficiaries who received CEA for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis during 1997 to 1998, reported a 0.85% rate of nonfatal myocardial infarction 20. A similar 1993 study of Medicare beneficiaries in Georgia (n = 1002) reported a 0.8% rate of myocardial infarction and a 0.6% rate of myocardial infarction–related death 21. Cranial nerve injury is another important potential harm; it occurred in 3.8% of patients (8 of 211) who received CEA in VACS, but none had permanent disability. The CASANOVA trial reported such CEA complications as lung embolism (1.4%), permanent cranial nerve damage (4.2%), pneumonia (1.4%), and local hematoma requiring surgery (2.8%). The total frequency of major complications (such as death, stroke, minor stroke, myocardial infarction, and permanent cranial nerve damage) in the group randomly assigned to immediate surgery was 7.9%. The MACE trial reported a 1.1% rate of minor cranial nerve injury in the 36 patients randomly assigned to CEA.

	The volume of patients treated by individual surgeons and centers is often suggested as an important factor that may affect outcomes. The USPSTF reviewed studies using Medicare data that reported the relationship between patient volume and adverse events after CEA. One study of Medicare beneficiaries who had CEA (350 procedures) during 1993 to 1994 in Oklahoma found combined 30-day stroke and death rates of 3.5% at high-volume hospitals (>100 Medicare-covered CEAs performed over the study period) and 5.2% at low-volume centers 22. A similar study of Medicare beneficiaries who received CEA at 115 hospitals in Ohio (167 procedures) reported stroke or death rates of 0% at high-volume centers and 4.9% at low-volume centers during 1993 to 1994 23. A major limitation of the evidence on harms associated with CEA is the dearth of recent data: all of the observational studies reporting on 30-day perioperative harms after CEA were based on data from the 1990s.

	Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit

	The USPSTF found no evidence that screening for carotid artery stenosis leads to additional treatment and benefit beyond standard preventive treatments based on traditional cardiovascular risk factors. In patients and surgeons similar to those in the RCTs, treatment with CEA for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis can result in a net absolute reduction in stroke rates, but this benefit has only been shown in selected patients with selected surgeons and must be weighed against a small increase in nonfatal myocardial infarctions. The net benefit of CEA largely depends on patients surviving the perioperative period without complications and living for at least 5 years. The magnitude of these benefits would be smaller in asymptomatic persons in the general population than among patients in RCTs.

	For the general primary care population, the magnitude of benefit is small to none. Adequate evidence indicates that both the testing strategy for carotid artery stenosis and treatment with CEA or CAAS can cause serious harms. In selected centers similar to those in the trials, CEA is associated with a 30-day stroke or mortality rate of approximately 2.4%; reported rates are as high as approximately 5% in low-volume centers and 6% in certain states. Myocardial infarctions are reported in 0.8% to 2.2% of patients after CEA. The 30-day stroke or mortality rate after CAAS is approximately 3.1% to 3.8%. The overall magnitude of harms is small to moderate depending on patient population, surgeon, center volume, and geographic location.

	The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis outweigh the benefits.

	How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?

	The medical treatment groups in the RCTs were poorly defined and probably did not include the intensive blood pressure and lipid control that is currently standard practice for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. It is difficult to determine what effect current standard medical therapy would have on comparative outcomes of medical and surgical treatments, including the potential incremental benefit of CEA.

	Response to Public Comment

	A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 18 February through 17 March 2014. All comments were reviewed and considered by the USPSTF. Many commenters agreed with the draft recommendation. Several requested clarification on the focus of this recommendation; the recommendation statement was revised to clarify that, for this recommendation, the USPSTF did not review new evidence on the use of carotid artery ultrasonography to evaluate risk for cardiovascular disease. A few commenters provided citations for related medical articles, and the USPSTF reviewed these for relevance to the current recommendation.",,Screening for Carotid Artery Stenosis,"Carotid Artery Stenosis, Screening, 2014"
"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to adults aged 18 years or older in primary care settings who are overweight or obese and have known CVD risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired fasting glucose, or the metabolic syndrome). In the studies reviewed by the USPSTF, the vast majority of participants had a BMI greater than 25 kg/m2.
<h3>Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>
Most studies evaluated interventions that combined counseling on a healthful diet and physical activity and were intensive, with multiple contacts (which may have included individual or group counseling sessions) over extended periods. Interventions involved an average of 5 to 16 contacts over 9 to 12 months depending on their intensity. Most of the sessions were in-person, and many included additional telephone contacts. Interventions generally focused on behavior change, and all included didactic education plus additional support. Most included audit and feedback, problem-solving skills, and individualized care plans. Some trials also focused on medication adherence. Interventions were delivered by specially trained professionals, including dietitians or nutritionists, physiotherapists or exercise professionals, health educators, and psychologists. <br /><br />Many types of intensive counseling interventions were effective. However, it was not clear how the magnitude of the effect was related to the format of the intervention (for example, face-to-face, individual, group, or telephone), the person providing the counseling, the duration of the intervention, or the number of sessions because different combinations of components were effective (see the <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/cvdhighrisk/cvdhighriskfinalrs.htm#implement"">Implementation section</a>for more information on effective interventions). Because of the intensity and expertise required, most interventions were referred from primary care and delivered outside that setting.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
Tobacco use continues to be one of the most important risk factors for CVD. Helping patients with tobacco cessation is a critical component of CVD prevention. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use and provide tobacco cessation interventions to those who use such products. The U.S. Public Health Service has published guidelines to further help clinicians.<br /><br />Multifaceted approaches with linkages between primary care practices and community resources could increase the effectiveness of interventions. Effective interactions between health care and community interventions, specifically public health and health policy interventions (such as healthy community design and built environment), can support and enhance the effectiveness of clinical interventions (more information is available at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/healthyplaces"">www.cdc.gov/healthyplaces</a>). The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends several community-based interventions to promote physical activity, including community-wide campaigns, social support interventions, school-based physical education, and environmental and policy approaches. It also recommends programs promoting diet and physical activity for persons who are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes on the basis of strong evidence of the effectiveness of these programs in reducing the incidence of new-onset diabetes. These recommendations are available at <a href=""http://www.thecommunityguide.org/"">www.thecommunityguide.org</a>.<br /><br />The Million Hearts initiative (<a href=""http://millionhearts.hhs.gov/"">http://millionhearts.hhs.gov</a>) aims to decrease the number of heart attacks and strokes by 1 million by 2017. It emphasizes the use of effective clinical preventive services combined with multifaceted community prevention strategies.<br /><br />In 2010, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services jointly issued the &ldquo;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&rdquo;. The latter also issued complementary physical activity guidelines.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The USPSTF has a wide range of recommendations focusing on CVD prevention. The current recommendation focuses on behavioral counseling that encourages healthy eating and physical activity behaviors to improve cardiovascular health. It does not address weight-loss programs. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively initiate behavioral counseling to promote a healthful diet and physical activity in patients who are not obese and not at increased cardiovascular risk. The USPSTF does not address behavioral counseling in patients with a BMI less than 25 kg/m2 who are at increased risk for CVD. However, for patients with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater, the USPSTF recommends screening these patients for obesity and offering or referring them to intensive, multicomponent behavioral counseling for weight loss.<br /><br />In another recommendation, the USPSTF recommends screening for lipid disorders in adults according to age and risk factors. It also recommends screening for blood pressure in adults, screening for diabetes in patients with elevated blood pressure, and aspirin use when appropriate. These recommendations are available at <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>.<br />&nbsp;
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
The USPSTF defines behavioral counseling interventions as preventive services that are designed to help persons engage in healthy behaviors and limit unhealthy ones. The USPSTF previously described the challenges of developing behavioral counseling recommendations that are feasible for primary care delivery or available for referral from primary care and delivered in other settings. Two well-researched interventions, the DPP (Diabetes Prevention Program) and PREMIER, could feasibly be adapted and delivered in the primary care setting or by local community providers. These interventions are described in further detail because they can be provided by an appropriately trained counselor (typically a dietitian, nutritionist, health educator, or psychologist) and their materials are publicly available. Descriptions of all of the reviewed interventions are included in the evidence review.<br /><br />The DPP focused on whether weight reduction through a healthful diet and physical activity could prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. Participants in the lifestyle intervention group received intensive training in diet, physical activity, and behavior modification from a case manager or lifestyle coach. Lifestyle coaches were dietitians or persons with a master's degree and training in exercise physiology, behavioral psychology, or health education. Participants received basic information about nutrition, physical activity, and behavioral self-management. The program addressed problem solving and strategies to deal with eating at restaurants, stress, and lapses. Participants and coaches engaged in face-to-face sessions at least once every 2 months and talked by telephone at least once between visits. The DPP study documents, including coach and participant materials, are available online in English and Spanish (<a href=""https://dppos.bsc.gwu.edu/web/dppos/lifestyle"">https://dppos.bsc.gwu.edu/web/dppos/lifestyle</a>). At least 1 trial included in the review&nbsp;used an adapted DPP lifestyle intervention in patients recruited from a primary care setting. The trial was conducted in a large multispecialty group practice. Investigators tested a coach-led intervention and a home-based, DVD-facilitated intervention, as well as a Web-based portal for goal setting and self-monitoring. The materials used for the intervention are available online from the University of Pittsburgh Diabetes Prevention Support Center (<a href=""http://www.diabetesprevention.pitt.edu/"">www.diabetesprevention.pitt.edu</a>).<br /><br />PREMIER tested whether counseling on comprehensive lifestyle changes could prevent or control high blood pressure. Participants in the intensive intervention group were counseled over 6 months to track their diet (including calorie and sodium consumption) and physical activity and received printed materials about blood pressure and lifestyle changes. In addition, they were taught to follow the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which is rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products and emphasizes reduced intake of saturated and total fat. The intervention was delivered by dietitians or health educators with a master's degree. The materials from this intervention, including participant manuals, food and fitness guides, and food diaries, are available online at <a href=""http://www.kpchr.org/research/public/premier/premier.htm"">www.kpchr.org/research/public/premier/premier.htm</a>. Information about the DASH diet is available from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Trials examining the effectiveness of less intensive counseling that can be delivered in the primary care setting, including the minimum intensity, number of interactions, and duration necessary for effectiveness, are needed, as are trials studying the duration of effect beyond 2 to 3 years of follow-up or beyond the intensive counseling intervention period. The effectiveness of interventions for physical activity alone has not been well-studied. Trials examining the interaction or potentiation of clinical counseling and community-based lifestyle interventions are needed. Finally, the lack of direct evidence of effect on CVD events is an important research gap. Advances in management of CVD risk factors and relatively low rates of CVD events in study populations present a challenge to researchers trying to assess differences in CVD outcomes.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/cvdhighrisk/cvdhighriskfinalrs.htm#summary,147,"The American Heart Association recommends that clinicians use counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity that include a combination of 2 or more of the following strategies: setting specific, proximal goals; providing feedback on progress; providing strategies for self-monitoring; establishing a plan for frequency and duration of follow-up; using motivational interviews; and building self-efficacy.<br /><br />The American College of Sports Medicine has published recommendations for health professionals who counsel healthy adults on individualized exercise programs. It recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week and 2 to 3 days of resistance, flexibility, and neuromotor exercises per week. Previous statements by the American Academy of Family Physicians about counseling for diet and physical activity have been consistent with those of the USPSTF; it is currently updating its recommendations.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/cvdhighrisk/cvdhighriskfinalrs.htm#recommendations,,Behavioral Counseling to Promote a Healthful Diet and Physical Activity for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in Adults With Cardiovascular Risk Factors,"Healthful Diet and Physical Activity for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in Adults With CVD Risk Factors, Counseling, 2014"
"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to asymptomatic, nonpregnant adolescents and adults at high risk for HBV infection (including those at high risk who were vaccinated before being screened for HBV infection).
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
A major risk factor for HBV infection is country of origin. The risk for HBV infection varies substantially by country of origin in foreign-born persons in the United States. Persons born in countries with a prevalence of HBV infection of 2% or greater account for 47% to 95% of those with chronic HBV infection in the United States (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/hepb/hepbfinalrs.htm#tab1"">Table 1</a>). Another important risk factor for HBV infection is lack of vaccination in infancy in U.S.-born persons with parents from a country or region with high prevalence (&ge;8%), such as sub-Saharan Africa, central and southeast Asia, and China (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/hepb/hepbfinalrsfig.htm"">Figure</a>). Because HBV infection prevalence may gradually change over time, it is important to note that some countries and regions with prevalence rates between 5-7% are considered to be highly endemic areas. <br /><br /><strong>Table 1.

<br />* Adapted from <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/hepb/hepbfinalrs.htm#ref2"">reference 2</a>. Estimates of prevalence of HBsAg, a marker of chronic hepatitis B virus infection, are based on limited data and may not reflect current prevalence in countries that have implemented childhood hepatitis B virus vaccination. In addition, the prevalence of HBsAg may vary within countries by subpopulation and locality.<br />&dagger; The regions with the highest prevalence (&gt;5%) are sub-Saharan Africa and central and southeast Asia. See <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/hepb/hepbfinalrsfig.htm"">Figure 2</a>.<br />&Dagger; A complete list of countries in each region is available at <a href=""http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2014/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/hepatitis-b"">http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2014/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/hepatitis-b.</a><br />&sect; Asia includes 3 regions: southeast, east, and north Asia. <strong>Abbreviation:</strong> HBsAg = hepatitis B surface antigen. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) uses a prevalence threshold of 2% or greater to define countries with high risk for HBV infection. Because this threshold is substantially higher than the estimated prevalence of HBV infection in the general U.S. population (0.3% to 0.5%), it is a reasonable threshold for deciding to screen a patient population or risk group. Additional risk groups for HBV infection with a prevalence of 2% or greater that should be screened include HIV-positive persons, injection drug users, household contacts or sexual partners of persons with HBV infection, and men who have sex with men (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/hepb/hepbfinalrs.htm#tab2"">Table 2</a>).<br /><br /><strong>Table 2.

<br />* Data from United States and western Europe. <br /><br /><strong>Abbreviation: </strong>HBV = hepatitis B virus. <br /><br />The CDC also recommends screening in persons receiving hemodialysis or cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy (for example, chemotherapy for malignant diseases and immunosuppression related to organ transplantation and for rheumatologic and gastroenterologic disorders). <br /><br />Some persons with combinations of risk factors who are not members of one of these risk factor groups may also be at increased risk for HBV infection. However, reliable information about combinations of risk factors is not available. Clinicians should exercise their judgment in deciding whether these persons are at sufficiently high risk to warrant screening. For example, screening is probably appropriate in settings that treat a large proportion of persons at increased risk, such as clinics for sexually transmitted infections; HIV testing and treatment centers; health care settings that provide services for injection drug users or men who have sex with men; correctional facilities; and institutions that serve populations from countries with a high prevalence of infection, including community health centers. <br /><br />The prevalence of HBV infection is low in the general U.S. population, and most infected persons do not develop complications. Therefore, screening is not recommended in those who are not at increased risk. The USPSTF notes that high rates of HBV infection have been found in cities and other areas with high numbers of immigrants or migrant persons from Asia or the Pacific Islands or their adult children. Providers should consider the population they serve when making screening decisions.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
The CDC recommends screening for HBsAg with tests approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, followed by a licensed, neutralizing confirmatory test for initially reactive results. Immunoassays for detecting HBsAg have a reported sensitivity and specificity greater than 98%. A positive HBsAg result indicates acute or chronic infection. <br /><br />Testing for antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs) and hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) is also done as part of a screening panel to help distinguish between infection and immunity. Acute HBV infection (acquired within 6 months after infection) is characterized by the appearance of HBsAg and followed by the appearance of IgM anti-HBc. The disappearance of HBsAg and the presence of anti-HBs and anti-HBc indicate the resolution of HBV infection and natural immunity. Anti-HBc, which persist for life, are present only after HBV infection and do not develop in persons whose immunity to HBV is due to vaccination.<br /><br />Persons who have received HBV vaccination have only anti-HBs. Diagnosis of chronic HBV infection is characterized by persistence of HBsAg for at least 6 months. Levels of HBV DNA can fluctuate and are not a reliable marker of chronic infection.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<h4>Antiviral Regimens</h4>
The goals of antiviral treatment are to achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication and remission of liver disease to prevent cirrhosis, hepatic failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Interferons or nucleoside or nucleotide analogues are used to treat HBV infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved 7 antiviral drugs for treatment of chronic HBV infection: interferon-&alpha;2b, pegylated interferon-&alpha;2a, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, telbivudine, and tenofovir. Approved first-line treatments are pegylated interferon-&alpha;2a, entecavir, and tenofovir. Combination therapies have been evaluated but are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and are generally not used as first-line treatment because tolerability, efficacy, and rates of resistance are low.&nbsp; <br /><br />Several factors affect the choice of antiviral drug, including patient characteristics, HBV DNA and serum aminotransferase levels, and HBeAg status. Biopsy is sometimes done to determine the extent of liver inflammation and fibrosis. Surrogate end points of antiviral treatment include loss of HBeAg and HBsAg, HBeAg seroconversion in HBeAg-positive patients, and suppression of HBV DNA to undetectable levels by polymerase chain reaction in patients who are HBeAg-negative and anti-HBe&ndash;positive. Duration of treatment varies depending on the time required to suppress HBV DNA levels and normalize alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels; HBeAg status; the presence of cirrhosis; and the choice of drug.
<h4>Vaccination</h4>
The current U.S. strategy to eliminate HBV transmission includes universal vaccination of all infants at birth and vaccination of adolescents and high-risk adults, such as injection drug users and household contacts of patients with HBV infection. Three doses of HBV vaccine result in a protective antibody response of greater than 90% in adults and greater than 95% in adolescents. The CDC recommends that susceptible persons who are screened for HBV infection may, if indicated, receive the first dose of the HBV vaccine at the same medical visit.
<h3>Screening Interval</h3>
Periodic screening may be useful in patients with ongoing risk for HBV transmission (for example, active injection drug users, men who have sex with men, and patients receiving hemodialysis) who do not receive vaccination. Clinical judgment should determine screening frequency, because the USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine specific screening intervals.<a name=""other""></a>
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
The development and validation of clinical decision support or other tools to help clinicians efficiently and accurately identify populations at high risk for HBV infection, including combinations of risk factors, are needed. Available clinical trials largely report intermediate or surrogate outcomes and are relatively short. Clinical trials of adequate duration and power to evaluate long-term health outcomes (for example, cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, disease-specific mortality, quality of life, and all-cause mortality) are needed. In the absence of such randomized, controlled trials, registries to assess treatment efficacy are also needed.

The development and validation of clinical decision support or other tools to help clinicians efficiently and accurately identify populations at high risk for HBV infection, including combinations of risk factors, are needed. Available clinical trials largely report intermediate or surrogate outcomes and are relatively short. Clinical trials of adequate duration and power to evaluate long-term health outcomes (for example, cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, disease-specific  mortality, quality of life, and all-cause mortality) are needed. In the absence of such randomized, controlled trials, registries to assess treatment efficacy are also needed.

"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults age 50 years and older.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
<h4>Smoking Status</h4>
Consuming 100 or more cigarettes is commonly used in epidemiologic literature to define an &ldquo;ever-smoker.&rdquo; However, the randomized trials of screening for AAA did not gather specific data about participants' smoking histories. Occasional tobacco use for a short time in the past (for example, occasional &ldquo;social&rdquo; smoking as an adolescent or young adult) is unlikely to have a pronounced biological effect, and the odds ratio (OR) of developing a large (&ge;5.0 cm) AAA is actually less than 1.0 for prior smokers who have quit for at least 10 years. However, observational studies have found that even a relatively modest smoking history (for example, smoking a half-pack or less per day for fewer than 10 years) does increase the likelihood of developing a large AAA.
<h4>Screening in Men Ages 65 to 75 Years Who Have Never Smoked</h4>
Despite the demonstrated benefits of screening for AAA in men overall, the lower prevalence of AAA in male never-smokers versus male ever-smokers suggests that clinicians should consider a patient's risk factors and the potential for harm before screening for AAA rather than routinely offering screening to all male never-smokers. Important risk factors for AAA include older age and a first-degree relative with an AAA; other risk factors include a history of other vascular aneurysms, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and hypertension. Factors associated with a reduced risk for AAA include African American race, Hispanic ethnicity, and diabetes.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Screening in Women Ages 65 to 75 Years Who Have Ever Smoked</h4>
<strong>Potential Preventable Burden</strong> <br /><br />A screening study in Sweden found that the prevalence of AAA in women age 70 years was low (0.8%) for ever-smokers but increased to 2.0% for current smokers. A meta-analysis of individual-patient data found that women have a higher risk than men for AAA rupture at the same diameter (hazard ratio [HR], 3.76 [95% CI, 2.58 to 5.47]). However, AAA-associated deaths occur at an older age in women (at a time of increased competing causes of death and a declining benefit&ndash;risk ratio for operative interventions), with 70% of deaths occurring after age 80 years in women compared with fewer than 50% in men. In the only screening RCT that included women, most screen-detected AAAs in women were small (3.0 to 3.9 cm) and AAA-specific mortality was low in screened and unscreened women (&lt;0.2%) after 10 years. <br /><br /><strong>Potential Harms</strong> <br /><br />Four RCTs (primarily done in men) showed that screening for AAA doubled the rate of AAA-associated surgeries, largely driven by an increase in elective surgeries. Most screen-detected AAAs were below the 5.5-cm threshold for immediate repair. This finding generally results in long-term or lifelong surveillance and is probably associated with some amount of overtreatment, although the magnitude of this burden is difficult to quantify. <br /><br />Most screening trials reported an associated decrease in emergency AAA repairs and a reduced 30-day mortality rate associated with emergency surgery in populations invited to screen, although mortality associated with elective surgery was not reduced. Operative mortality associated with AAAs is higher in women than in men (7% vs. 5% for open repair and 2% vs. 1% for endovascular repair, respectively). <br /><br /><strong>Costs</strong> <br /><br />In addition to the cost of ultrasonography screening (approximately $100), the estimated potential associated cost of elective surgery to repair a screen-detected AAA ranges from $37,000 to $43,000. Potential opportunity costs also may arise, because screening may take the place of other preventive activities that may be of greater benefit to the patient. <strong><br /><br />Current Practice <br /><br /></strong>Screening for AAA is provided as part of the &ldquo;welcome-to-Medicare visit&rdquo; for women who have a family history of AAA. However, the evidence is insufficient to accurately characterize current practice patterns related to screening for AAA in women.<br /><br /> A retrospective analysis from 2000 to 2010 used the National Inpatient Sample, a database that has a stratified 20% random sample of all nonfederal inpatient hospital admissions in the United States. This analysis found that women are more likely than men to have open surgery versus endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for unruptured AAA (24% vs. 17%, respectively), potentially because of issues with access to the iliac artery (that is, smaller artery size) that may preclude endovascular management. <br /><br />A retrospective review of 4,026 AAA repairs in the Vascular Study Group of New England database (a voluntary registry from 30 academic and community hospitals in six New England states) reported that women were more likely than men to have open surgery versus EVAR and to be older and have smaller aortic diameters at the time of repair. Postoperative complications were higher in women than in men after elective EVAR or open repair, including emergency reoperations, dysrhythmias, leg ischemia or emboli, bowel ischemia, or need for discharge to another medical facility rather than home.
<h3>Screening Methods</h3>
Conventional abdominal duplex ultrasonography was the primary method used in the available trials of AAA screening. Primary care physicians and vascular surgeons widely accept abdominal duplex ultrasonography as the standard approach. Screening with ultrasonography is noninvasive and easy to do and has high sensitivity (94% to 100%) and specificity (98% to 100%) for detecting AAA. In addition, it has shown high rates of reproducibility, does not expose patients to radiation, and is relatively low-cost.<br /><br />The use of handheld, portable ultrasonography devices in clinician office settings has been proposed as an alternative approach to conventional abdominal duplex ultrasonography done in the radiology setting. Several small observational studies suggest that in-office handheld ultrasonography has reasonable sensitivity and specificity for AAA detection compared with conventional ultrasonography. However, it has not been formally evaluated in a clinical trial.
<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>
Evidence is adequate to support one-time screening in men who have ever smoked. All of the population-based RCTs of AAA screening used a one-time screening approach, and several fair- to good-quality prospective cohort studies show that AAA-associated mortality over 5 to 12 years is low (0.0% to 2.4%) in men with initially normal results on ultrasonography.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
In the available screening trials, immediate referral for open surgery in patients with large AAAs (&ge;5.5 cm) and conservative management via repeated ultrasonography every 3 to 12 months for smaller AAAs (3.0 to 5.4 cm) achieved the observed AAA-related mortality benefit. Surgical referral of smaller AAAs was reserved for AAAs that grew rapidly (&gt;1.0 cm per year) or reached a threshold of 5.5 cm or larger on repeated ultrasonography. <br /><br />Although early open surgery for smaller AAAs reduces the risk for rupture compared with surveillance, it does not reduce AAA-specific or all-cause mortality. Endovascular aneurysm repair is an alternative to open surgery. As with open surgery, early EVAR did not differ from surveillance for smaller AAAs in all-cause or AAA-related mortality in randomized trials that evaluated these interventions. Unlike early open surgery, early EVAR does not reduce the incidence of AAA rupture. <br /><br />Pharmacotherapy has been proposed to slow the growth of smaller AAAs. Short-term treatment with antibiotics or &beta;-blockers does not seem to reduce AAA growth, and the trials were underpowered to draw conclusions about effects on health outcomes.<br /><br /><br />
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Although evidence shows that women who smoke are at increased risk for AAA compared with nonsmoking women, evidence that screening this population confers a net benefit is insufficient. The same is true for men and women with a family history of AAA. Ideally, appropriately powered RCTs with planned a priori subgroup analyses would be done to answer these critical questions. In the absence of new trial data, high-quality modeling studies should be done to determine whether screening is beneficial in women who smoke or in men and women with a family history of AAA. <br /><br />Several risk-scoring tools have been developed and, if prospectively validated, could be used to identify patients most likely to benefit from screening. Thus, validation studies of these tools should be prioritized. Because of the importance of family history as a risk factor, the role of genetic markers of AAA development should be explored. <br /><br />Alternative strategies to reduce AAA growth, such as antibiotics, statins, or other novel pharmacologic agents, need to be further explored. Interventions to address modifiable risk factors (particularly smoking) may be worth considering. Effective strategies for smoking cessation may improve the care of patients with small AAAs. Seven ongoing RCTs are evaluating pharmacotherapeutic effects on small AAAs; however, the outcome in most trials is aneurysmal growth, and the trials are underpowered to detect changes in health outcomes. Appropriately powered studies that can assess health outcomes should evaluate whether such treatments are viable options in preventing death.<br /><br />One screening RCT, the VIVA (Viborg Vascular) trial, is currently evaluating the effectiveness of combined screening for AAA, peripheral artery disease, and hypertension in 50,000 men ages 65 to 74 years; results are not expected until after 2018. Participants who screen positive for AAA or peripheral artery disease are advised on exercise, low-fat diet, and smoking cessation and are managed with statins and aspirin. They receive annual surveillance for AAA and peripheral artery disease, and those with an AAA measuring 5.0 cm or larger are referred for surgery. <br /><br />Followup will occur at 3.5, 10, and 15 years for the primary outcome of all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes include cardiovascular mortality, AAA-specific mortality, AAA prevalence and progression, health-related quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. This study may also provide evidence as to whether a screen-detected AAA can be used as a marker and improve outcomes for other cardiovascular diseases.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf14/abdoman/abdomanfinalrs.htm#consider,145,"The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association jointly recommend one-time screening for AAA with physical examination and ultrasonography in men ages 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked and in men age 60 years or older who are the sibling or offspring of a person with AAA. These organizations do not recommend screening for AAA in men who have never smoked or in women. The Society for Vascular Surgery recommends one-time ultrasonography screening for AAA in men age 55 years or older with a family history of AAA, all men age 65 years or older, and women age 65 years or older who have smoked or have a family history of AAA. The American College of Preventive Medicine recommends one-time screening in men age 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked; it does not recommend routine screening in women.<br /><br />The Canadian Society for Vascular Surgery recommends ultrasonography screening for AAA in men age 65 to 75 years who are candidates for surgery and willing to participate. In individualized cases, some women older than 65 years with multiple risk factors for AAA (smoking history, cerebrovascular disease, or family history) may be considered for screening. The European Society for Vascular Surgery recommends that men should be screened for AAA with a single ultrasonography at age 65 years, but screening should be considered at an earlier age in men at higher risk (for example, those who smoke, have other cardiovascular disease, or have a family history). It notes that screening in older women generally does not reduce the incidence of aneurysm rupture but that screening women who smoke may require further investigation.","Burden of Disease
Abdominal aortic aneurysms, defined by an aortic diameter of 3.0 cm or larger, affect an estimated 3.9% to 7.2% of men and 1.0% to 1.3% of women age 50 years or older. Several recent studies from population-based screening programs in men age 65 years or older have reported a declining prevalence of AAA over the past two decades in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Sweden (overall prevalence estimates range from 1.5% to 1.7%).1, 2 One recent study in 70-year-old women in Sweden reported a similar decline in the overall prevalence of AAA (to approximately 0.5%) (9). This decline may be due to a reduced rate of smoking and improved treatment of hypertension and hyperlipidemia in these populations. However, the prevalence of AAA in male and female smokers does not seem to have declined.
The primary risk associated with AAA is rupture, which may occur suddenly and without symptoms and is often fatal. However, the risk for AAA rupture varies substantially by the size of the aneurysm. The annual risk for rupture is nearly 0% for AAAs between 3.0 and 3.9 cm in diameter, 1% for those between 4.0 and 4.9 cm in diameter, and 11% for those between 5.00 and 5.99 cm in diameter.1, 2
An estimated 59% to 83% of patients with AAA rupture die before hospitalization; operative mortality (in-hospital or 30-day) is approximately 40%. Thus, at most, 10% to 25% of persons with a ruptured AAA survive. Almost all deaths from ruptured AAA occur after age 65 years, and most deaths in women occur after age 80 years.1, 2
Scope of Review
The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to update its 2005 recommendation on screening for AAA. The review assessed the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for AAA and strategies for managing small (3.0 to 5.4 cm) screen-detected AAAs.
Accuracy of Screening Tests
Feasible or referable primary care screening tests for AAA include ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and physical examination. The performance characteristics of these screening methods were not systematically reviewed for this updated recommendation.
Ultrasonography is the primary technology used to screen for AAA because it is noninvasive, low-cost, and easy to do; does not expose patients to radiation; and has high sensitivity (94% to 100%), specificity (98% to 100%), and rates of reproducibility for detection.1, 2 Computed tomography has relatively high sensitivity (90%) and specificity (91%) for detecting AAA but exposes patients to radiation and detects aneurysms that are generally 2 mm larger than those measured by ultrasonography, probably because the cross-section of the aorta obtained by axial CT imaging is not in the transverse plane and therefore yields an overestimate of AAA size 27. Physical examination has far lower sensitivity (approximately 39% to 68%) and specificity (75%) than ultrasonography or CT.1, 2
Effectiveness of Screening and Treatment
Screening Studies
Four large, population-based RCTs that predominantly enrolled men age 65 years or older examined the effectiveness of one-time screening for AAA: the good-quality MASS (Multicentre Aneurysm Screening Study) (n = 67,800) 28; the good-quality Viborg County, Denmark, screening trial (n =12,639) 29; the fair-quality Chichester, United Kingdom, screening trial (n = 15,775) 7; and the fair-quality Western Australia screening trial (n = 41,000).30 Reported mean (or median) ages ranged from 67.7 to 72.7 years; the oldest participants were age 80 years.1, 2
Men
The prevalence of AAA in male screening participants ranged from 4.0% to 7.7% across the studies. Most screen-detected AAAs were small; only 0.4% to 0.6% of screened participants had an AAA measuring 5.0 or 5.5 cm or larger.1, 2
AAA-Related Mortality
MASS and the Viborg trial each found a statistically significant reduction in AAA-related mortality in the groups invited to screening compared with the control groups up to 13 years after screening (13-year HR, 0.58 [CI, 0.49 to 0.69] vs. 0.34 [CI, 0.20 to 0.57], respectively) 3, 4. The absolute risk reduction in MASS was 0.14% (0.19% of men in the screened group vs. 0.33% in the control group) or 1.4 fewer AAA-related deaths per 1,000 men screened 3. The Western Australia and Chichester trials also had results favoring the screening group, but they were not statistically significant.30, 31
All-Cause Mortality
None of the individual trials showed a statistically significant benefit of screening for AAA for all-cause mortality at up to 15-year followup. Pooled analysis of all available trials using a prespecified random-effects model also showed no effect on all-cause mortality (risk ratio, 0.98 [CI, 0.97 to 1.00]); sensitivity analysis using a profile likelihood estimation method yielded identical results. Sensitivity analysis using ORs and a fixed-effects model found a statistically significant result at the longest time period (OR, 0.973 [CI, 0.950 to 0.997]).1, 2 A lack of an all-cause mortality benefit is not entirely unexpected, because fewer than 3% of participant deaths were attributable to AAA across the trials.
AAA Rupture
Invitation to screening was associated with a statistically significant reduced rate of AAA rupture in MASS (HR, 0.57 [CI, 0.49 to 0.66]) and the Viborg trial (HR, 0.44 [CI, 0.24 to 0.79]) at 13-year followup 3, 4. The Chichester trial found no statistically significant reduction in rupture rate at 15 years, although the point estimate was in the direction of benefit (HR, 0.88 [CI, 0.61 to 1.26]) 31. The Western Australia trial found no statistically significant difference at a median followup of 3.6 years (33 ruptures in the intervention group vs. 38 ruptures in the control group).30
Emergency Surgery
The rate of emergency AAA repair for rupture in the screened population was approximately halved after 13 years in MASS.3 In the Viborg trial, acute surgeries were reduced at up to 15 years (HR, 0.50 [CI, 0.15 to 1.65]), although the result was not statistically significant after 10-year followup (HR, 0.32 [CI, 0.17 to 0.60]) 4, 29.The Chichester and Western Australia trials found no differences in the rate of emergency surgeries.30, 31
Older Men
Two of the population-based screening trials analyzed AAA-associated mortality by age. The Viborg trial found similar risk reduction in AAA-related mortality with screening men ages 64 to 65 years and men ages 66 to 73 years 4. The Western Australia trial found no difference in AAA-associated mortality with screening men ages 65 to 74 years (OR, 0.82 [CI, 0.37 to 1.84]) versus those age 75 years or older (OR, 1.13 [CI, 0.56 to 2.29]).30
Women
As noted previously, only the Chichester study included women (ages 65 to 80 years). It found a low prevalence of AAA in women (1.3%), and 75% of screen-detected AAAs in women measured 3.0 to 3.9 cm. Rupture rates (0.06% in both groups), AAA-specific mortality (<0.2% in both groups), or all-cause mortality (10.7% vs. 10.2%) at 5 years did not statistically significantly differ in the invitation-to-screening and control groups 8.
Event rates in women were low, and the trial was ultimately underpowered to draw definitive conclusions about health outcomes in women. Although the individual risk for AAA rupture at a smaller aneurysm diameter seems to be higher in women than in men 14, the overall AAA rupture rate in women is low. More than two-thirds of deaths from AAA occur in women age 80 years or older, as the Chichester trial reported 8.
Treatment Studies
Standard Intervention for Large (≥5.5 cm) AAAs
Management strategies for large AAAs include open surgery and EVAR to avoid arterial rupture. Randomized trials have substantially evaluated open surgical repair, the conventional method for repairing large AAAs, which has been shown to consistently reduce AAA-related mortality in patients with screen-detected AAA.1, 2
Endovascular aneurysm repair may provide selective short-term advantages over open surgery, such as avoidance of general anesthesia and reduced operative time, blood loss, and postoperative pain. Three major trials (the EVAR 1 trial, the OVER [Open Versus Endovascular Repair] trial, and the DREAM [Dutch Randomized Endovascular Aneurysm Management] trial) compared open surgery with EVAR for large AAAs; findings suggest that EVAR has a lower operative mortality rate than open surgery, but AAA-specific and all-cause mortality do not differ between the two interventions 32–34. Endovascular aneurysm repair has a higher reintervention rate than open repair and generally requires lifelong, regular followup via ultrasonography or CT.1, 2
Early Intervention for Small (3.0 to 5.4 cm) AAAs
In total, eight RCTs assessed the effects of early surgery compared with surveillance or pharmacotherapy compared with placebo for small AAAs. Two good-quality RCTs (UKSAT [United Kingdom Small Aneurysm Trial] and the ADAM [Aneurysm Detection and Management] trial) compared early open surgery with surveillance for AAAs measuring 4.0 to 5.4 cm 22, 23. In both trials, early open surgery (HR, 0.94 [CI, 0.75 to 1.17]) and surveillance for all-cause mortality (RR 1.21 [CI, 0.95 to 1.54]) did not statistically significantly differ after approximately 5 years. During 12-year followup, UKSAT continued to find no benefit to early surgery versus surveillance for all-cause mortality.1, 2
In the ADAM study, risk for AAA-associated mortality in the immediate repair group versus the surveillance group (RR 1.15 [CI, 0.58 to 2.31]) did not decrease; 30-day postoperative mortality also did not differ 23. In UKSAT, more deaths from ruptured AAA occurred in the surveillance group than in the early intervention group (17 vs. 6 deaths); however, 43% of the fatal ruptures were from AAAs measuring larger than 5.5 cm in diameter, and autopsy confirmed cause of death in only 29% of cases 22. Further, the relative magnitude of effect decreased with additional followup. Mortality related to AAAs accounted for approximately 7% of all deaths recorded.1, 2
In addition, these two trials also reported all-cause mortality by age and AAA diameter subgroups, which did not statistically significantly differ between early open surgery and surveillance 22, 23. All-cause mortality between the groups did not differ by sex in UKSAT 23.
Two fair-quality RCTs (the CAESAR [Comparison of Surveillance Versus Aortic Endografting for Small Aneurysm Repair] and PIVOTAL [Positive Impact of Endovascular Options for Treating Aneurysms Early] trials) evaluating early EVAR versus surveillance showed that AAA-specific or all-cause mortality and the AAA rupture rate after 2 years of followup did not differ between the two groups; however, the number of reported events for these outcomes in both trials was small, limiting the certainty of these findings 24, 25.
One good-quality, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of the β-blocker propranolol showed that 2 years of treatment did not statistically significantly affect AAA growth rate, AAA-specific mortality, or all-cause mortality 35. Pooled analysis of one good- and two fair-quality RCTs evaluating the use of several antibiotics for 4 to 15 weeks revealed no differences in all-cause mortality or surgical procedure rate compared with placebo. Results were inconsistent for the effect on the growth rate of AAAs.1, 2
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
Screening
Each of the four available population-based screening RCTs showed an approximate doubling of all AAA-related surgeries at 3 to 5 years, driven primarily by an increase in elective surgeries. This overall increase in surgeries persisted at 13 to 15 years, although the magnitude of difference decreased to some extent.1, 2
Five small observational studies evaluated quality of life, anxiety, and depression, with conflicting results. One study showed that physical functioning, social functioning, and mental health scores statistically significantly decreased from baseline in participants who screened positive for AAA at 12 months 36; however, the other four studies did not show similar clinically important effects.1, 2 No studies evaluated labeling in patients who screened positive for AAA, although it is a potential harm.
Treatment
Two good-quality RCTs showed that early open repair compared with surveillance for small AAAs (3.0 to 5.4 cm) increased the number of surgeries by 50% (313 additional surgeries per 1,000 patients) but did not affect AAA-specific or all-cause mortality, the surgical mortality rate, or short-term quality of life 22, 23. Similarly, two fair-quality trials found that early EVAR doubled the rate of AAA-associated surgeries (approximately 484 to 582 more surgeries per 1,000 patients) compared with surveillance, with no resulting AAA-specific mortality benefit or improvements in quality of life 24, 25.
One RCT of propranolol versus placebo for treating small AAAs reported a high discontinuation rate over 2 years (60% of participants receiving the active intervention) due to adverse events, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and bradycardia 35. Three RCTs of antibiotics found a low rate of adverse events over 4 to 15 weeks.1, 2
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening for AAA in men ages 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked provides a moderate benefit in reducing AAA-specific mortality. Adequate evidence indicates that the harms of screening for AAA in this population are at least small. The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that screening for AAA in men ages 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked is of moderate net benefit.
The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for AAA in men ages 65 to 75 years who have never smoked provides a small benefit in reducing AAA-specific mortality. Adequate evidence indicates that the harms of screening for AAA in this population are at least small. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for AAA in men ages 65 to 75 years who have never smoked is at best of small net benefit.
Only a single screening trial of AAA included women, and it showed no benefit in preventing AAA-specific mortality, overall mortality, or AAA rupture in this population. However, the trial was underpowered for drawing sex-specific conclusions and, as such, does not definitively rule out the possibility of a small benefit, especially in women who are current smokers.
Overall, women have a lower prevalence of AAA than men at any age and seem to develop AAA at a later age than men. Most ruptures in women occur after age 80 years, when many competing causes of death are present. The USPSTF therefore found inadequate evidence that screening for AAA in women ages 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked provides a benefit in reducing AAA-specific mortality. Adequate evidence indicates that the harms of screening for AAA in this population are at least small and may be higher than those in men because of higher rates of operative mortality. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the net benefit of screening for AAA in women ages 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked.
The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the AAA-specific mortality benefit of screening for AAA in women who have never smoked can effectively be bounded at small to none. Adequate evidence indicates that the harms of screening for AAA in this population are at least small and may be higher than those in men because of higher rates of operative mortality. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for AAA in women ages 65 to 75 years who have never smoked is of no net benefit.
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
An AAA is a weakening in the wall of the abdominal section of the aorta. Once a section of the aortic wall is weakened, pressure from the blood flowing through the vessel causes the aorta to bulge or balloon, resulting in an aneurysm. A large proportion of AAAs are asymptomatic until rupture. Rupture of an AAA can be acute and is life-threatening. Therefore, considering an effective method for screening and treating appropriate patients before rupture is important.",,Screening for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,"Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm, Screening, 2014"
"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to children age 5 years and younger.<br /><br />The USPSTF limited its consideration of caries screening and prevention by primary care clinicians to infants and preschool-aged children. The rationale for this decision was that, at the present time, nondental primary care clinicians are more likely than dentists to have contact with children ages 5 years and younger in the United States; this situation changes as children reach school age and beyond. In addition, as children grow older, dental professionals use sealants rather than fluoride varnish. As such, the USPSTF limited its review of the evidence of preventive interventions for dental caries to this age group. This recommendation should not be construed to imply that preventive interventions for dental caries should cease after 5 years of age.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
All children are at potential risk for dental caries; those whose primary water supply is deficient in fluoride (defined as containing &lt;0.6 ppm F) are at particular risk. While there are no validated multivariate screening tools to determine which children are at higher risk for dental caries, there are a number of individual factors that elevate risk. Higher prevalence and severity of dental caries are found among minority and economically disadvantaged children. Other risk factors for caries in children include frequent sugar exposure, inappropriate bottle feeding, developmental defects of the tooth enamel, dry mouth, and a history of previous caries. Maternal and family factors can also increase children's risk. These factors include poor oral hygiene, low socioeconomic status, recent maternal caries, sibling caries, and frequent snacking. Additional factors associated with dental caries in young children include lack of access to dental care; inadequate preventive measures, such as failure to use fluoride-containing toothpastes; and lack of parental knowledge about oral health.<br /><br />Some organizations have advocated restricting fluoride varnish use to children at &ldquo;increased risk.&rdquo; Although several caries risk assessment tools exist, none have been validated in the primary care setting, nor do existing studies demonstrate that these tools, when used by primary care clinicians, can accurately and consistently differentiate between children who will develop dental caries and those who will not. A risk-based approach to fluoride varnish application will miss opportunities to provide an effective dental caries preventive intervention to children who could benefit from it, particularly because currently, in the United States, infants and preschool-aged children are more likely to have regular visits with nondental primary care clinicians than dental care providers.
<h3>Interventions to Prevent Dental Caries</h3>
As noted previously, oral fluoride supplementation prevents dental caries in patients with inadequate water fluoridation.<br /><br />All children with erupted teeth can potentially benefit from the periodic application of fluoride varnish, regardless of the levels of fluoride in their water. Though the evidence to support varnish is drawn from higher-risk populations, the provision of varnish to all children is reasonable since the prevalence of risk factors is high in the U.S. population, the number needed to treat is low, and the harms of the intervention are small to none.<br /><br />The USPSTF did not review the evidence on the effectiveness of tooth brushing, but regular tooth brushing with fluoride toothpaste by children is very important in preventing dental caries.
<h3>Timing and Dosage of Preventive Interventions</h3>
No studies specifically addressed the dosage and timing of oral fluoride supplementation in children with inadequate water fluoridation. The American Dental Association (ADA) recommendations on the dosage of and age at which to start dietary fluoride supplementation take into account the amount of fluoride in the child's water source. These dosing recommendations are also referenced by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).<br /><br />No study directly assessed the appropriate ages at which to start and stop the application of fluoride varnish. Available trials of fluoride varnish enrolled children ages 3 to 5 years; however, given the mechanism of action of this intervention, benefits are very likely to accrue starting at the time of primary tooth eruption. Limited evidence found no clear effect on caries increment between performing a single fluoride varnish once every 6 months versus once a year or between a single application every 6 months versus multiple applications once a year or every 6 months.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding I Statement</h3>
In deciding whether to routinely perform screening examinations for dental caries in children from birth to age 5 years, clinicians should consider the following.
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
Dental caries is the most common chronic disease in children in the United States. It is four times more common than childhood asthma and seven times more common than hay fever. According to the NHANES, the prevalence of dental caries has risen from 24% to 28% between 1988&ndash;1994 and 1999&ndash;2004. Approximately 20% of surveyed children with caries had not received treatment. Symptomatic dental caries in children are associated with pain, loss of teeth, impaired growth, and decreased weight gain and can affect appearance, self-esteem, speech, and school performance. Dental-related concerns lead to the loss of more than 54 million school hours each year .
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
No studies examined the harms of performing primary care screening examinations for dental caries in children from birth to age 5 years. However, given the noninvasive nature of an oral examination, these harms are expected to be minimal.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
In one study, only about half of pediatricians reported examining the teeth of half of their patients ages 0 to 3 years.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
In April 2013, the Community Preventive Services Task Force recommended fluoridation of community water sources based on strong evidence of effectiveness in reducing dental caries. It also recommends school-based dental sealant delivery programs to prevent caries. Xylitol may have promise as an additional method to reduce the risk for dental caries.<br /><br />Xylitol is classified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a dietary supplement and is found in over-the-counter consumer products such as wipes or gum. A single small, fair-quality trial of xylitol wipes use in children ages 6 to 35 months found a 91% relative reduction in decayed, missing, or filled surface increment. However, four other studies showed no clear effect of xylitol on caries risk in children younger than age 5 years. As such, there is currently not enough evidence to formally recommend its routine use in caries prevention.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
Many primary care providers already prescribe oral fluoride supplementation to patients with low levels of fluoride in their water; however, application of fluoride varnish is not currently commonly performed in many primary care offices (estimated at about 4% of practices in 2009). The techniques for application are simple and easy to learn, and fluoride varnish does not require specialized equipment or personnel and can be applied quickly. However, providers and other qualified staff may require some training before offering this procedure. Dentists and physicians can apply varnish in all states. In some states, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, and medical assistants can also do so. <br /><br />Efforts are underway to address concerns surrounding resources, infrastructure, training, and payment mechanisms for the provision of fluoride varnish in the nondental primary care setting. For example, the AAP Section on Oral Health has partnered with the Health Resources and Services Administration's Maternal and Child Health Bureau and the ADA Foundation to educate and advocate for primary pediatric care professionals to apply fluoride varnish. They have created a Web site with a number of helpful tools and resources to assist nondental primary care providers, including how to acquire the materials required to provide varnish, as well as state-by-state information on billing codes and any training requirements (available at <a href=""http://www2.aap.org/oralhealth/PracticeTools.html"">http://www2.aap.org/oralhealth/PracticeTools.html</a>). The National Interprofessional Initiative on Oral Health, a consortium of funders and health professionals, focuses on educating and training primary care clinicians on oral health prevention (additional information available at <a href=""http://www.niioh.org/"">http://www.niioh.org</a>).
<h3>Cost</h3>
State Medicaid reimbursement for fluoride varnish application, when offered, ranges from $9 to $53 per application when applied by licensed providers who have had appropriate training, including physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, and licensed practical nurses (varying by state).
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Studies are needed to assess and validate multivariate risk assessment tools that can accurately identify high-risk populations most likely to benefit from caries preventive interventions, such as fluoride varnish. <br /><br />Further research would also be helpful to confirm the benefits of fluoride varnish among lower-risk and younger children. <br /><br />Racial and ethnic minority children, as well as children living in low socioeconomic conditions, are at significantly increased risk for caries compared with white children and children who live in adequate to high socioeconomic conditions. Future studies on risk assessment and preventive interventions should enroll sufficient numbers of racial and ethnic minority children to understand the benefits and harms of interventions in these specific populations. <br /><br />More research is also needed to estimate the effectiveness of interventions by clinicians to educate parents and caregivers about optimum health practices for oral hygiene at home.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/dentalprek/dentchfinalrs.htm#consider,142,"The AAP has issued two policy statements related to dental care in children. The first, issued in 2003 and reaffirmed in 2009, encourages providers to incorporate oral health&ndash;related services into their practices. Specifically, the AAP recommends an oral health assessment for all children by age 6 months and a first dental visit by age 1 year. The second statement supports oral fluoride supplementation and application of fluoride varnish in children &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; for dental caries. <br /><br />The ADA recommends that children be seen by a dentist within 6 months of eruption of the first tooth and no later than age 12 months. It also recommends the application of fluoride varnish every 6 months in preschool-aged children who are at &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; risk for dental caries and every 3 to 6 months in children who are at &ldquo;high&rdquo; risk. It recommends daily dietary fluoride supplements for children from birth to age 16 years who are at &ldquo;high&rdquo; risk for developing dental caries and whose primary source of drinking water is deficient in fluoride; &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; status can be determined using risk assessment tools developed by one of several professional health organizations. Dietary fluoride supplementation is not recommended when water fluoridation levels are greater than 0.6 ppm F. <br /><br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that clinicians counsel parents about appropriate use of fluoridated toothpastes, especially in children age 2 years and younger; prescribe fluoride supplements to children at high risk for dental caries whose drinking water lacks adequate fluoridation; and limit the use of high-concentration fluoride products, such as varnish and gel, to high-risk individuals. <br /><br />The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry states that fluoride dietary supplements should be considered for children at risk for caries who drink fluoride-deficient (&lt;0.6 ppm) water. It also states that children at increased risk for caries should receive a professional fluoride treatment (e.g., 5% sodium fluoride varnish or 1.23% acidulated phosphate fluoride) every 6 months. <br /><br />The American Academy of Family Physicians is updating its recommendations on the subject.","Burden of Disease

	Dental caries is the most common chronic disease in children in the United States, and is increasing in prevalence among young children1. According to the NHANES, the prevalence of tooth decay in primary teeth in children ages 2 to 5 years increased from approximately 24% to 28% between 1988–1994 and 1999–20042. Approximately 20% of surveyed children with caries had not received treatment for the condition.

	In addition, the NHANES found that among children ages 2 to 11 years, 54% of children in households living below the federal poverty threshold had primary dental caries, as well as one third of children in households living 200% above the poverty threshold. Fifty-five percent of Mexican American children have dental caries compared with 43% of African American children and 39% of white children. Mexican American children are also more likely to have untreated dental caries (33%) than African American (28%) and white (20%) children2.

	Early childhood caries can cause pain, loss of teeth, caries later in life, impaired growth/weight gain, missed school days, and negative effects on quality of life. Caries in early childhood are associated with failure to thrive and can affect speech, appearance, and school performance. They are also associated with an increased risk for caries in additional primary or permanent teeth. More than 51 million hours of school are missed each year because of childhood dental concerns16.

	Scope of Review

	To update the 2004 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review of the evidence on prevention of dental caries by primary care clinicians in children age 5 years and younger. The review focused on screening for caries, assessment of risk for future caries, and the effectiveness of various medications that have possible benefits in preventing caries.

	Risk Assessment

	No studies assessed the effectiveness of the use of formal risk assessment tools by primary care clinicians in identifying children at highest risk for dental caries. Although there are tools available from several professional organizations for use in the primary care setting, no studies evaluated their performance or use.

	Effectiveness of Preventive Interventions

	Fluoride Supplementation

	Six older studies27–32 assessed the effectiveness of oral fluoride supplementation; the USPSTF found no new studies since its previous 2004 review. Although the studies had some methodological limitations, such as lack of adjustment for potential confounders, inadequate blinding, or unreported attrition, and were fairly heterogeneous, they support the conclusion that oral fluoride supplementation leads to decreased dental caries in children age 5 years and younger who have inadequate fluoridation in their water. The single randomized trial (n=140; fluoridation level <0.1 ppm F) found that 0.25 mg fluoride drops or chews were associated with decreased risk for caries versus no fluoride supplementation in Taiwanese children age 2 years at enrollment31. Relative reductions ranged from 52% to 72% for decayed, missing, and filled teeth and from 51% to 81% for decayed, missing, and filled tooth surfaces. Across all six trials, relative reductions with fluoride supplementation ranged from 32% to 72% for decayed, missing, and filled teeth and from 38% to 81% for decayed, missing, and filled tooth surfaces versus placebo (vitamin drops) or no supplementation8, 9.

	Fluoride Varnish

	Three recent good- and fair-quality trials assessed professionally applied topical fluoride varnish in children age 5 years and younger. The trials compared fluoride varnish applied every 6 months with no fluoride varnish. One was conducted in rural Canadian Native populations without water fluoridation and another was conducted in an Australian aboriginal community with water fluoridation levels of less than 0.6 ppm F for nearly 90% of participants33, 34. The third trial enrolled primarily Latino and Chinese underserved children in an urban U.S. community with adequate water fluoridation 13. All three trials found that fluoride varnish was associated with a decreased risk for dental caries after 2 years. Absolute mean reductions in the number of affected tooth surfaces ranged from 1.0 to 2.4 8, 9.

	Three fair-quality studies evaluated the effect of frequency of fluoride varnish application on caries outcomes13–15. Two found that multiple fluoride varnish applications within a 2 week period were associated with no statistically significant differences in caries incidence versus a 6 month application schedule14, 15. One trial found no statistically significant difference in caries rates for once versus twice yearly varnish application]]13]]. The optimum frequency of fluoride varnish application is not known.

	Effectiveness of Screening

	No studies examined the effectiveness of routine oral screening examinations performed by primary care clinicians in preventing dental caries8, 9.

	Potential Harms of Preventive Interventions

	The USPSTF considered a recently updated systematic review on enamel fluorosis that includes five new studies that were not available for the 2004 recommendation35. These observational studies consistently found an association between early childhood exposure to systemic fluoride and enamel fluorosis. The evidence is limited in that measures of early childhood fluoride exposure were based on parental recall [8, 9]]. Risk estimates ranged from an odds ratio of 10.8 (95% CI, 1.9 to 62) for exposure during the first 2 years of life to a slight increase in risk (odds ratio, 1.1 to 1.7, depending on comparison)35. Fluorosis can range from mild (small white spots or streaks) to severe (discoloration, pitting, or brown staining), depending on the overall systemic fluoride exposure level over time. In the United States, the prevalence of severe enamel fluorosis is estimated at less than 1%5.

	No studies reported the risk for fluorosis with fluoride varnish application; however, the degree of systemic fluoride exposure following varnish application is low3, 4.

	Potential Harms of Screening

	No studies compared harms in children who were receiving routine oral screening examinations versus those not screened for dental caries by primary care providers 8, 9.

	Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit

	The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit to prescribing oral fluoride supplementation at recommended doses starting at age 6 months to children with inadequate fluoride in their water.

	There is also moderate net benefit to applying fluoride varnish to the primary teeth of all infants and children starting at the age of primary tooth eruption.

	The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the effectiveness of routine caries screening examinations performed by primary care providers to improve outcomes in children age 5 years and younger. The USPSTF also found inadequate evidence regarding the potential harms.

	Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence on the benefits and harms of routine caries screening examinations performed by primary care providers in children age 5 years and younger is lacking, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.

	How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?

	Systemic fluoride becomes incorporated into tooth structures during their formation. If fluoride is ingested repeatedly during tooth development, it is deposited throughout the tooth surface and provides protection against caries. Topical fluoride treatments, such as varnishes, help protect teeth that are already present. In this method, fluoride is incorporated into the surface layer of the teeth, making them more resistant to decay. Systemic fluoride also provides some measure of topical effects, as it is found in the saliva and bathes the teeth. Thus, providing both systemic and topical fluoride to children during tooth development fits with the biologic understanding of fluoride's protective actions against dental decay36, 37.

	Response to Public Comments

	A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 21 May to 20 June 2013. All comments received were reviewed during the creation of the final recommendation statement. Based on public feedback, the USPSTF separated its recommendation on fluoride supplementation and the application of fluoride varnish into two parts to increase clarity surrounding the relevant populations for each intervention. The USPSTF expanded its rationale for why it recommends fluoride varnish for all infants and children once their primary teeth have erupted, rather than only those deemed to be at “high” risk, and why it believes that the available evidence was sufficient to make this recommendation for nondental primary care providers. The USPSTF added language concerning potential implementation issues for the use of fluoride varnish by primary care professionals. The USPSTF also clarified the definitions of “primary care provider,” “dental practitioner,” and “inadequate water fluoridation.” Finally, the USPSTF included an explanation of the target age range for this recommendation and provided additional details on enamel fluorosis.",,Prevention of Dental Caries in Children From Birth Through Age 5 Years,"Dental Caries in Children from Birth Through Age 5 Years, Screening and Interventions, 2014"
"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to adolescents, adults, and older adults in the general U.S. population who do have an identified psychiatric disorder.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
In 2010, suicide accounted for more than 1.4 million years of potential life lost before age 85 years, or 4.3% of total years of potential life lost in the United States. Past studies estimated that 38% of adults (50% to 70% of older adults) visited their primary care provider within 1 month of dying by suicide. Nearly 90% of suicidal youths were seen in primary care during the previous 12 months.<br /><br />Given that most persons who die by suicide have a psychiatric disorder and many have been seen recently in primary care, primary care clinicians should be aware of psychiatric problems in their patients and should consider asking these patients about suicidal ideation and referring them for psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or case management. The USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians screen adolescents and adults for depression when appropriate systems are in place to ensure adequate diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. Primary care clinicians should also focus on patients during periods of high suicide risk, such as immediately after discharge from a psychiatric hospital or after an emergency department visit for deliberate self-harm. Recent evidence suggests that interventions during these high-risk periods are effective in reducing suicide deaths.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
Evidence on the potential harms of screening for suicide risk is insufficient.
<h4>Costs</h4>
The monetary cost of screening for suicide risk is minimal. Additional time would be needed in the primary care visit to accommodate screening.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
In a study of U.S. primary care providers, suicide was discussed in 11% of encounters with patients who had (unbeknown to their providers) screened positive for suicidal ideation. Similarly, 36% of U.S. primary care physicians explored suicide in encounters with standardized patients presenting with major depression or adjustment disorder or those who sought antidepressants. Less than one quarter of surveyed primary care pediatricians or family practice physicians in Maryland reported that they frequently or always screened adolescents for suicide risk factors.
<h3>Risk Factors for Suicide</h3>
Although evidence to determine whether the general asymptomatic population should be screened for suicide risk is inadequate, providers should consider identifying patients with risk factors or those who seem to have high levels of emotional distress and referring them for further evaluation.<br /><br />Suicide risk varies by age, sex, and race or ethnicity. In men, the greatest increases in suicide rate were in those aged 50 to 54 years (49.4% [from 20.6 to 30.7 deaths per 100,000]) and those aged 55 to 59 years (47.8% [from 20.3 to 30.0 deaths per 100,000]). In women, the suicide rate increased with age, and the largest percentage increase was in those aged 60 to 64 years (59.7% [from 4.4 to 7.0 deaths per 100,000]). <br /><br />American Indians and Alaskan natives aged 14 to 65 years and non-Hispanic white persons older than 18 years have higher-than-average rates of suicide death, and the risk among non-Hispanic white persons continues to increase after age 75 years. The highest rates are seen in American Indians and Alaskan natives aged 19 to 24 years and non-Hispanic white persons older than 75 years. Among adolescents, Hispanic females are at especially high risk for attempting suicide. <br /><br />The greatest increases in suicide rate from 1999 to 2010 by racial or ethnic population in men and women overall were among American Indians and Alaskan natives (65.2%) and white persons (40.4%). Among American Indians and Alaskan natives, the suicide rate in women increased by 81.4% (from 5.7 to 10.3 deaths per 100,000) and the rate in men increased by 59.5% (from 17.0 to 27.2 deaths per 100,000). Among white persons, the rate in women increased by 41.9% (from 7.4 to 10.5 deaths per 100,000) and the rate in men increased by 39.6% (from 24.5 to 34.2 deaths per 100,000). <br /><br />Increased risk is also associated with the presence of a mental health disorder, such as depression, schizophrenia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance use disorders. About 87% of patients who die by suicide meet the criteria for 1 or more mental health disorders. A lifetime history of depression more than doubles the odds of a suicide attempt in U.S. adults, and depression is probably present in 50% to 79% of youths attempting suicide, although it may not always be recognized. <br /><br />Other important risk factors for suicide attempt include serious adverse childhood events; family history of suicide; prejudice or discrimination associated with being lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender; access to lethal means; and possibly a history of being bullied, sleep disturbances, and such chronic medical conditions as epilepsy and chronic pain. In males, socioeconomic factors, such as low income, occupation, and unemployment, are also related to suicide risk. <br /><br />In older adults, additional risk factors, such as social isolation, spousal bereavement, neurosis, affective disorders, physical illness, and functional impairment, increase the risk for suicide. Risk factors of special importance to military veterans include traumatic brain injury, separation from service within the past 12 months, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other mental health conditions. <br /><br />Individual risk factors have limited ability to predict suicide in an individual at a particular time. A large proportion of Americans have 1 of these risk factors; however, only a small proportion will attempt suicide, and even fewer will die by it.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
The reviewed studies used various screening tools. One example is the Suicide Risk Screen, a 20-item screening instrument embedded in a broader self-report questionnaire administered in high schools to youths at risk for dropping out of school. Another tool consists of 3 suicide-related items (&ldquo;thoughts of death,&rdquo; &ldquo;wishing you were dead,&rdquo; and &ldquo;feeling suicidal&rdquo; within the past month) targeting primary care patients aged 18 to 70 years with scheduled appointments.<br /><br />Sensitivity and specificity of screening tools generally ranged from 52% to 100% and from 60% to 98%, respectively. The instruments showed a wide range in accuracy, but data were limited and no instruments were examined in more than 1 study.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
Most effective treatments to reduce risk for suicide attempt include psychotherapy. The most commonly studied psychotherapy intervention was cognitive behavioral therapy and related approaches, including dialectical behavior therapy, problem-solving therapy, and developmental group therapy. Other approaches included psychodynamic or interpersonal therapy. Although most of these treatments are not customarily administered by primary care providers in the office, patients can be referred to behavioral health providers for them. The primary care provider can play a continued role in the care of these patients by monitoring them during the process, providing follow-up, and coordinating with other care providers.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
In addition to approaching the problem of suicide from an individual level in primary care, approaches are being implemented at community, regional, and national levels. In the health care system, laws requiring coverage parity between mental and physical health disorders will give more persons the ability to access care for psychiatric problems associated with suicide, such as depression. Efforts to coordinate care among programs that address mental health, substance use, and physical health can also increase access to care. Activities that have been shown to be correlated with lower suicide rates in other countries include detoxification of domestic gas in the United Kingdom and discontinuation of the use of highly toxic pesticides in Sri Lanka. These actions were associated with 19-33% and 50% reductions in suicide, respectively, providing evidence that engineering controls can be effective. Such activities as installing barriers at frequent suicide jump spots may also be effective.<br /><br />On an individual level, patients with a history of suicide attempt or suicidal ideation should not have easy access to means that may be used in suicide attempts, such as firearms or other weapons, household chemicals or poisons, or materials that can be used for hanging or suffocation.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The USPSTF recommends that physicians screen adolescents and adults for depression when appropriate systems are in place to ensure adequate diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up (available at <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>). <br /><br />The Community Preventive Services Task Force has related recommendations on collaborative care approaches to managing depression, mental health parity policy, and home-based depression care for older adults (available at <a href=""http://www.thecommunityguide.org/mentalhealth/index.html"">www.thecommunityguide.org/mentalhealth/index.html</a>). <br /><br />In 2012, the U.S. Surgeon General and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention released the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention, which includes goals and objectives for action (available at <a href=""http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/reports/national-strategy-suicide-prevention/full-report.pdf"">www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/reports/national-strategy-suicide-prevention/full-report.pdf</a>). <br /><br />The Suicide Prevention Resource Center, supported by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, offers various resources on suicide prevention (available at <a href=""http://www.sprc.org/"">www.sprc.org</a>).&nbsp;<br />
<h2><br />Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
More research on the epidemiology and natural history of suicide risk is needed. Persons who attempt suicide and survive and those who die by suicide are overlapping populations. Some individuals die on their first attempt and may never be seen in primary care, whereas others may repeat nonfatal attempts and never die or die after multiple attempts. More research to understand these subgroups and to determine who accesses primary care is needed. <br /><br />Several key areas need further research to improve the evidence base for screening for suicide risk in primary care. For screening to be effective, more information on the performance characteristics of screening tests, particularly in average-risk adolescents,n is needed. More information is needed to determine whether more individuals with screen-detected suicidal ideation could be helped before they act. Studies examining the benefits and potential harms of targeted versus general screening would also be helpful. The possibility of incorporating technology into large-scale screening studies should also be explored. <br /><br />Treatment studies in populations with screen-detected suicide risk in all age groups are needed. Targeting persons at high risk, such as American Indians and Hispanic persons, may help determine whether tailored therapies are more effective in these populations. It is critical that more investigations on the benefits and risks of interventions targeting average- and high-risk adolescents be conducted. Trials including interventions aimed at parents have shown some promise and should be further explored. <br /><br />It would also be valuable to replicate trials in adults that focus primarily on the process of care (including quality of care and patient adherence) rather than the specific content of treatment sessions because trials on the latter have shown moderate-sized but statistically nonsignificant effects. <br /><br />Investigating ways to link clinical and community resources might also lead to other possible methods to help patients at risk for suicide.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/suicide/suicidefinalrs.htm#consider,143,"Several groups have made recommendations or commented on screening patients for suicide risk. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry recommends that clinicians be aware of patients at high risk for suicide. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pediatricians ask questions about mood disorders, sexual orientation, suicidal thoughts, and other risk factors associated with suicide during routine health care visits. The American Medical Association states that all adolescents should be asked annually about behaviors or emotions that indicate recurrent or severe depression or risk for suicide and that physicians should screen for depression or suicidal risk in those with risk factors, such as family dysfunction, declining school grades, and history of abuse. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that all adolescents be screened annually for emotions and behaviors that indicate recurrent or severe depression and thoughts of killing or harming themselves. In addition, suicide risk and depressive symptoms are included as part of the College's annual well-woman visit evaluation and counseling recommendations for females aged 13 to 65 years or older. The American Academy of Family Physicians concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for suicide risk in adolescents, adults, and older adults in primary care. The recommendation of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care also mirrors the 2004 USPSTF recommendation in that it found poor evidence to include or exclude routine evaluation of suicide risk during a periodic health examination.","Burden of Disease

	In 2010, suicide was the 10th leading cause of death among all age groups in the United States, leading to almost 37,000 deaths at a rate of 11.8 deaths per 100,000 persons1. Although suicide rates in the United States remained steady from 1990 through the early 2000s, they have generally been increasing over the past decade, particularly between 2005 and 200912. Suicide is among the 5 leading causes of death in children, adolescents, and adults aged 10 to 54 years 1.

	In 2011, 7.8% of high school students reported attempting suicide at least once during the previous 12 months, and 2.4% of students made a suicide attempt that required treatment due to self-injury2. In the same year, an estimated 3.7% of adults aged 18 years or older reported having serious thoughts of suicide during the past year, and 0.5% attempted suicide13.

	Scope of Review

	In 2004, the USPSTF concluded that the evidence was insufficient to recommend for or against routine screening by primary care clinicians to detect suicide risk in the general population and issued an I statement, given that there was no evidence at the time that screening for suicide risk reduced suicide attempts or mortality. The USPSTF noted that there was limited evidence on the accuracy of screening tools to identify suicide risk in the primary care setting, including tools to identify high-risk persons. The USPSTF also found insufficient evidence that treatment of high-risk persons reduces suicide attempts or mortality. The USPSTF found no studies that directly addressed the harms of screening and treatment for suicide risk. As a result, the USPSTF could not determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening for suicide risk in primary care.

	In updating the 2004 recommendation, the USPSTF reviewed evidence on the accuracy and reliability of instruments used to screen for increased suicide risk, benefits and harms of screening for increased suicide risk, and benefits and harms of treatment to prevent suicide.

	Accuracy of Screening Tests

	The USPSTF reviewed 4 studies that evaluated the accuracy of screening instruments to identify persons at increased risk for suicide. Of these, 2 were conducted in adolescent populations that were considered to be at increased risk. One was conducted in an outpatient mental health setting in patients who had a prior diagnosis of depression14. The second was conducted in a school setting and consisted of a questionnaire administered by research staff to students at risk for school dropout15. An additional study involved primary care patients aged 65 years or older16, and the final study involved primary care patients aged 18 to 70 years17.

	Each study used a different tool to screen patients for increased suicide risk. All 4 studies were considered to be fair-quality. A strength of these studies was that they each applied the same reference standard to all screened participants and recruited the sample from a single identified population. However, as mentioned previously, neither of the studies of adolescents was conducted in a primary care setting and both recruited participants who were already at increased risk for suicide. Only 1 of the 4 studies reported that the reference test was independent of the screening test16. An additional concern was the lag time between the screening and reference tests, with only 1 study conducting both within 24 hours of each other. Lag times for other studies ranged from 0 to 35 days or were not reported.

	Effectiveness of Early Detection

	The USPSTF found no direct evidence that screening for suicide risk is associated with improved health outcomes in asymptomatic adolescents or adults. Although studies evaluating screening were more likely to be conducted in a primary care population, studies assessing the effectiveness of treatment were predominantly conducted in patients known to be at high risk. In particular, many treatment studies were of patients with previous suicide attempts or a history of mental illness, such as borderline personality disorder or depression. The proportion of patients in control groups with a history of suicide attempts in treatment studies ranged from 11% to 68%, evidence that the study populations were at high risk for suicide 2.

	Three broad treatment approaches to suicide prevention have been evaluated: psychotherapy, enhanced usual care (approaches designed to improve the quality or format of recommended treatment or improve patient adherence to usual care), and medications. Of these, psychotherapy providing specific treatment approaches showed better outcomes than enhanced usual care; few studies addressed medications. Suicide attempts were reduced by a pooled average of 32% in 11 psychotherapy trials in adults. Interventions that focused on enhancing usual care showed little effect on suicide deaths, suicide attempts, or related outcomes. A single large trial of older primary care patients reported a 20% reduction in the relative risk for a combined outcome of suicide attempts and ideation; however, the study involved education and training of a volunteer sample of general practitioners, who may have been more motivated to improve their practice than a random sample of general practitioners18.

	Minimal data are available on the effectiveness of using medications to prevent suicidal behavior. The lone study was a short-term, fair-quality trial that assessed the use of lithium (19). The study reported hazard ratios that suggested a possible benefit for suicide attempts but were not statistically significant. There was a statistically significantly lower rate of suicide deaths per patient-year in the intervention group; however, the study had high attrition rates and there were only 3 suicide deaths.

	The evidence base for treatment interventions in adolescents is limited. Study populations primarily consisted of participants at high risk for suicide, most with recent suicide attempts or acute suicidal ideation. The effect of treatment to prevent suicide on suicide deaths could not be determined because there was only 1 death in any of the 3 trials that reported this outcome. Suicide attempts were not reduced with psychotherapy treatment at 6 to 18 months. The CI for the pooled effect was wide and crossed zero, ranging from a 25% reduction in risk to a 31% increase. Therefore, the possibility of harm or benefit cannot be ruled out with the existing evidence from psychotherapy trials2.

	The sole enhanced usual care study in adolescents also had a sample of high-risk patients, all of whom had a history of suicide attempts, threats, or ideation20. Although the study was rated fair-quality, the groups were not entirely comparable at baseline and retention varied. The study did not find any differences between the groups in suicidal ideation, depression, or hopelessness at the 12-month follow-up, thus providing no evidence of treatment benefit.

	Potential Harms of Screening

	Three studies reported on the potential adverse effects of screening. One was a trial of adults with depression in 4 primary care practices in the United Kingdom. The other 2 were conducted in high school settings.

	In the study of adults, no statistically significant increases in suicide attempts or ideation were seen at 2 weeks after screening21. The trial, however, had a relatively small sample (n = 443) and limited power. In addition, differential ascertainment may have biased the results; a higher proportion of participants who were screened withdrew consent for follow-up (6.6% of screened vs. 2.2% of unscreened).

	In both of the high school studies, students were randomly assigned to screening for suicide risk on 1 of 2 occasions 1 to 2 days apart. The items used to screen for suicide risk were embedded in an instrument that addressed broader mental health issues. The larger trial (n = 2342), conducted in 6 high schools in New York, randomly assigned the students at the classroom level22. No immediate increase in students reporting suicidal ideation or mean suicidal ideation score was reported.

	The second study, conducted in Australia, was smaller (n = 308) and found no differences between the 2 groups in anger, confusion, depression, fatigue, or tension based on Profile of Mood States scores immediately after screening for suicide risk or completion of other mental health items23. “Vigor” was the only characteristic that was reported to be higher in screened participants. After both groups had completed the suicide risk screening items, 8.9% reported that the suicide-related items were “moderately distressing” or “very distressing” and 31.5% found them to be “a little distressing.”

	Because of the paucity of data and study limitations, the possibility of short-term harms from participation in suicide screening cannot be dismissed, although no serious adverse events were documented in the studies. Other potential harms of screening include harms that may result from treatment in persons with screen-detected risk after referral.

	Few treatment trials in adults reported adverse events. One cognitive behavioral therapy trial reported that none of the suicide attempts was believed to be a result of study participation24. In a study of a video-based problem-solving intervention, none of the participants withdrew because of worsening symptoms25. A study of writing as a means for reducing suicidal ideation reported that 3 participants asked to speak with a supervisor because they became upset after writing or their writing reflected current suicidal ideation (26). Not enough data were available to draw conclusions on whether harms occurred due to screening in adults.

	Of the 11 adolescent psychotherapy treatment trials reporting suicide attempts, 4 noted non–statistically significant increases in suicide attempts, ranging from 22% to 113%27–29. One was a small trial that had few events and wide CIs associated with the effect; however, the other trials probably had enough events to represent stable but still statistically nonsignificant effects. Thus, the possibility of harm due to treatment cannot be ruled out in currently or recently suicidal adolescents receiving therapy.

	In the medication trial that evaluated treatment with lithium, a higher percentage of participants in the treatment group than in the placebo group withdrew from the study because of adverse events (13% vs. 2%), although the statistical significance was not reported and overall dropout rates were similar between the groups19.

	Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit

	The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of screening tests for suicide risk, the effectiveness of treatment, and the harms of screening or treatment. In attempting to build a chain of indirect evidence from screening to treatment to beneficial health outcomes, the link between screening and treatment is problematic because of the poor fit between the populations in the 2 bodies of evidence. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening is lacking for adolescents, adults, and older adults.

	Response to Public Comments

	A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 23 April to 21 May 2013. Most comments generally agreed with the recommendation statement. However, many requested clarification about whether it applies only to primary care settings. Several comments expressed concern that primary care providers would interpret the I statement as a statement against screening for suicide risk. In response to these comments, the USPSTF clarified that the recommendation applies to screening in a primary care setting, updated statistics on suicide, included additional information on risk factors, expanded the Research Needs and Gaps section, and updated the Recommendations of Others section.","<p><strong>Importance</strong> <br />Suicide was the 10th leading overall cause of death in the United States in 2010 and 1 of the 5 leading causes of death for children, adolescents, and adults aged 10 to 54 years. Rates of suicide attempts and deaths vary by sex, age, and race or ethnicity. Psychiatric disorders and previous suicide attempts increase suicide risk. <br /><br /><strong>Detection</strong> <br />There is insufficient evidence to conclude that screening adolescents, adults, and older adults in primary care adequately identifies patients at risk for suicide who would not otherwise be identified based on an existing mental health disorder, emotional distress, or previous suicide attempt. <br /><br /><strong>Benefits of Detection and Early Intervention or Treatment</strong> <br />Evidence on the benefits of screening adolescents, adults, and older adults for suicide risk in primary care is inadequate. &nbsp; <br /><br />Evidence is inadequate on whether interventions reduce suicide risk in patients identified through primary care screening or similar methods; most evidence for treatment effectiveness is in high-risk populations who were not discovered through screening, such as persons who presented to an emergency department because of a suicide attempt. <br /><br /><strong>Harms of Detection and Early Intervention or Treatment</strong> <br />Evidence on the possible harms of screening adolescents, adults, and older adults for suicide risk is inadequate. <br /><br /><strong>USPSTF Assessment</strong> <br />The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on screening for suicide risk in primary care is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.</p>","Suicide Risk in Adolescents, Adults, and Older Adults in Primary Care","Suicide Risk in Adolescents, Adults and Older Adults, Screening, 2014"
"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to children and adolescents younger than age 18 years. It does not apply to children and adolescents who have been diagnosed with a substance use disorder. All persons with a substance use disorder should receive appropriate treatment. Although this statement does not include a recommendation on screening for drug use, further information on screening tests is provided in the <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/drugmisuse/drugmisusefinalrs.htm#discussion"">Discussion</a>&nbsp;section.
<h3>Definitions</h3>
The USPSTF recognizes that various definitions have been applied to the terms <em>drug use</em>, <em>misuse</em>, and <em>abuse</em>. For the purpose of this recommendation statement, &ldquo;drug use&rdquo; encompasses the general concepts of &ldquo;illicit drug use&rdquo; and &ldquo;nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals&rdquo; (prescription and over-the-counter drugs). &ldquo;Illicit drug use&rdquo; specifies use of illegal drugs (such as cocaine and heroin) and inhalants (such as aerosols, glue, and gasoline). &ldquo;Nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals&rdquo; includes the use of prescribed medications for a purpose other than prescribed (or by a person not prescribed the medication) or the use of over-the-counter drugs for a purpose other than medically indicated. To be consistent with the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition</em>, &ldquo;substance use disorder&rdquo; is used instead of &ldquo;substance abuse&rdquo; and &ldquo;substance dependence&rdquo; unless describing previously collected study or survey results that reported findings using the terms <em>abuse</em> and <em>dependence</em>.
<h3>Behavioral Interventions</h3>
Although the evidence to recommend specific interventions in the primary care setting is insufficient, interventions that have been studied include face-to-face counseling, videos, print materials, and interactive computer-based tools. Studies on these interventions provide little to no evidence of significant improvements in health outcomes.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
In deciding whether to provide behavioral interventions to prevent or reduce illicit drug and nonmedical pharmaceutical use for children and adolescents, primary care providers should consider the following.
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
According to the NSDUH, nearly 1 in 10 American adolescents use drugs. In 2011, the Drug Abuse Warning Network estimated that more than 75,000 emergency department visits by children and adolescents involved illicit drugs, and more than 75,000 visits involved the nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals. The consequences of drug use include risk for progression to a substance use disorder, an increase in risk-taking behaviors while under the influence, and lower educational achievement and attainment. Persons who initiate marijuana use at younger ages are more likely to progress to drug abuse and dependence as adults compared with those who initiate use after age 18 years.
<h4>Costs</h4>
The costs associated with primary care&ndash;based behavioral interventions vary substantially and are similar to costs of interventions for tobacco and alcohol reduction. Health systems and providers should account for the staff time associated with any intervention, which may range from distributing educational materials to a series of office-based, 1-on-1 counseling sessions. Computer-based interactive tools linked to an adolescent's personal health record may require less ongoing staff time to administer. There are also potential costs for families, especially for interventions that require significant participation from parents as well as adolescents.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
Potential harms associated with behavioral interventions include anxiety, interference with the clinician&ndash;patient relationship, opportunity costs (that is, time spent on these interventions that could be used for other, more effective interventions), unintended increases in other risky behaviors, and even paradoxical increases in drug use or initiation. Although evidence is limited, no direct harms were identified.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
Most clinicians who care for children and adolescents in the United States do not provide behavioral interventions to reduce drug use. Given the lack of evidence of effective primary care&ndash;based interventions, this is not surprising. It is important to recognize that this recommendation does not address screening for drug use. Screening adolescents who are not suspected to be using drugs may identify some who meet criteria for a substance use disorder and for whom treatment is available. The Task Force did not find effective interventions to reduce future drug use in adolescents who have tried illicit drugs.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The USPSTF has made recommendations on screening for and interventions to decrease the unhealthy use of other substances, including alcohol and tobacco. These recommendations are available on the USPSTF Web site (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Illicit drug and nonmedical pharmaceutical use in adolescents is an important public health problem. Evidence to assess the effects of behavioral interventions in adolescents is limited, and high-quality studies that focus on the role of primary care professionals in preventing initiation of drug use and reducing use among those who have experimented are needed. Research on brief interventions; interventions that link screening with tailored interventions; and social media, cell phone, and Internet-based interventions is needed and may identify novel, effective risk-reduction strategies. Research should continue to study diverse populations and the effects of interventions on children and adolescents with different risks, as well as which interventions work best in these subpopulations. Research should continue to examine the effectiveness of behavioral interventions with and without parental involvement. Additional high-quality studies that evaluate interventions and address drug use in the context of other substances, including tobacco and alcohol, are also needed. Research to develop and validate tools to measure current and past substance use is needed. Attention should be given to the standardization of research outcomes to improve the ability of future systematic reviews to move the field forward.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/drugmisuse/drugmisusefinalrs.htm#consider,140,"The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all adolescents be screened for alcohol and drug use and that, based on the results, clinicians conduct further assessment, provide guidance and brief counseling interventions, and, if appropriate, refer for treatment. The American Academy of Family Physicians' recommendation on interventions to address drug use in children and adolescents is currently under review.","Burden of Disease

	According to the NSDUH, more than 4300 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years use drugs for the first time each day in the United States (1). The first drug used is often marijuana (by approximately two thirds of adolescents). However, for more than 1 in 4 adolescents, the initial drug is a prescription medication taken for nonmedical purposes (most often an opioid pain medicine). The percentage of adolescents aged 12 to 17 years who report drug use in the past month is greater than those who report cigarette use and only slightly less than those who report alcohol use (9.5% vs. 6.6% vs. 12.9%, respectively) 11. More than 7% of adolescents aged 12 to 17 years report marijuana use in the past month; 2.8% report using prescription-type drugs for nonmedical purposes; and less than 1% report cocaine, hallucinogen, or inhalant use 1. In addition, in 2012, 4.4% of eighth-, tenth-, and twelfth-grade students reported using over-the-counter cough or cold medicine in the past year for nonmedical reasons 2. In 2012, the rate of drug dependence or abuse in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years was 4% 1.

	Drug use is associated with many negative health, social, and economic consequences and is a significant contributor to 3 of the leading causes of death among adolescents: motor vehicle accidents, homicide, and suicide. Consequences not only arise from frequent or heavy drug use, but use increases risk-taking behaviors while intoxicated, such as driving under the influence, unsafe sexual activity, and violence. In 2011, more than 150,000 adolescents were treated in emergency departments for complications of illicit drug and nonmedical pharmaceutical use 3.

	Scope of Review

	The USPSTF uses the term drug use to reflect a spectrum of behaviors that may progress, typically in stages. The stage of primary abstinence includes persons who never use drugs. The stages of use begin with experimentation and may progress from limited use to problematic or harmful use and mild to severe substance use disorder. The stage of secondary abstinence includes persons who stop using drugs. The focus of this recommendation is 2-fold: interventions to help adolescents who have never used drugs to remain abstinent and interventions to help adolescents who are using drugs but do not meet criteria for a substance use disorder to reduce or stop their use. Adolescents who are diagnosed with a substance use disorder require treatment. These treatments are not part of clinical prevention and are outside the scope of this recommendation.

	This review includes consideration of illicit drug and nonmedical pharmaceutical use, which includes both prescription and over-the-counter medications. Although the USPSTF recognizes that laws that apply to marijuana use are shifting in some areas of the United States, potentially raising questions about whether marijuana is an illicit drug, the Task Force includes marijuana use within the scope of this recommendation. Other illicit drugs within the scope of this recommendation include cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, and inhalants.

	Nonmedical use of prescription and over-the-counter medications involves taking a drug for reasons other than why it was prescribed or recommended, often by a person other than for whom it was prescribed and for the purpose of “getting high.” The largest classes of prescription medications used for nonmedical purposes within the scope of this recommendation are opioid pain relievers, central nervous system depressants (commonly called tranquilizers), and stimulants, including medications used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Nonmedical use of over-the-counter medications, including dextromethorphan and cough suppressants, also occurs. This recommendation only applies to psychoactive medications and does not include the nonmedical use of anabolic steroids or athletic performance–enhancing drugs.

	Although alcohol and tobacco are both psychoactive drugs, they are not the focus of this recommendation. The USPSTF has made separate recommendations on screening and counseling adolescents for tobacco and alcohol use.

	Screening Tests

	Although the focus of this recommendation is not on screening for drug use, screening may allow behavioral interventions to be tailored to the situation of the individual adolescent. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the CRAFFT (Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, Trouble) screening tool (available at www.projectcork.org/clinical_tools/pdf/CRAFFT.pdf), which was developed specifically for use with adolescents. The 2-part screening tool takes less than 2 minutes to administer and screens for alcohol and drug use. It is designed to be delivered as an interview or paper- or computer-based self-report. It is simple to score and has good sensitivity and specificity across a range of populations and settings.

	Although the USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to make a recommendation for or against behavioral interventions to prevent or reduce drug use in children and adolescents who do not have a substance use disorder, primary care professionals may consider screening adolescent patients to identify those who are experiencing consequences of drug use. Adolescents who have a substance use disorder should receive appropriate treatment.

	Effectiveness of Behavioral Interventions to Change Behavior and Outcomes

	The USPSTF found only 6 fair- or good-quality studies of 4 primary care–relevant behavioral interventions that focused on reducing drug use in adolescents 4. These interventions included face-to-face counseling, videos, print materials, and interactive computer-based tools. Although the interventions substantially varied in their intensity, components, populations, and sample sizes, they provide almost no evidence of significant improvements in health outcomes. A few changes in drug use and drug initiation were found, but given the lack of clear and consistent findings and the overall small evidence base, the USPSTF could not draw definitive conclusions. It is possible that brief primary care–relevant interventions do not significantly affect adolescent drug use or that more effective interventions may need to be developed.

	Harris and colleagues 5 conducted a large trial of a brief behavioral intervention provided in primary care practice settings. The intervention included computer-assisted screening of more than 2000 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years using the CRAFFT screening tool; a nontailored, brief, computer-based educational session; and 2 to 3 minutes of tailored advice from the patient's primary care clinician. Clinicians were provided with training and given talking points for each patient based on his or her responses to the CRAFFT questionnaire. The intervention targeted alcohol and marijuana use and took less than 10 minutes to complete. Although relevant in U.S. practice, the U.S. group of the study found no significant differences between the intervention and control groups in marijuana initiation, cessation, or consequences of use at the 12-month follow-up. The study did find a statistically significant reduction in the number of adolescents who did not initiate alcohol use in the U.S. intervention group at 12 months (adjusted relative risk ratio, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.47 to 0.93]). The study's parallel group in the Czech Republic found a large and statistically significant reduction in the initiation of marijuana use and an increase in cessation rates at 12 months in the intervention group (adjusted relative risk ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.29 to 0.76] and 2.53 [95% CI, 1.06 to 6.05], respectively) but no effect on alcohol use 5.

	Walton and colleagues (6) conducted a study that involved more than 300 U.S. adolescents aged 12 to 18 years who reported marijuana use. The trial compared the effectiveness of an interactive computer-delivered intervention and a therapist-delivered intervention based on motivational interviewing with a control group. Both interventions took approximately 35 to 40 minutes to complete. The study authors concluded that there were “no effects of a computer or therapist behavioral intervention on cannabis use” 6.

	Schinke, Fang, and Cole 7–10 conducted 3 studies, reported in 4 publications, of a similar intensive, computer-based behavioral intervention delivered at home to mothers and their daughters aged 11 to 14 years. Mothers and daughters each completed a 45-minute interactive session weekly for 9 weeks; some sessions were completed separately and others completed together. The goals for the mothers were not solely focused on drug use and included improving communication with their daughters, monitoring their daughters' behaviors and activities, building their daughters' self-image and self-esteem, and establishing rules and consequences for substance use. For the daughters, the program focused on building skills for managing stress, conflict, and mood; dealing with peer pressure; and improving body esteem and self-efficacy. The studies measured several outcomes and examined marijuana, nonmedical prescription drug, and inhalant use. They found statistically significant decreases in marijuana use and nonmedical use of prescription drugs in all 3 studies after 12 to 24 months, as well as statistically significant decreases in inhalant use in 1 study. The studies used an unusual and difficult-to-interpret measure of drug use. It seems that overall drug use was very low across the studies, and the clinical significance of the results is difficult to determine. It is not clear whether the intervention helped girls who had never used drugs to remain abstinent or helped a few girls who were frequently using drugs to reduce or stop their drug use 7–10.

	Potential Harms of Behavioral Interventions

	No studies provided evidence about the magnitude of the harms of behavioral interventions to prevent or reduce drug use. Although the USPSTF recognizes that theoretical harms, such as the potential to increase drug initiation through a false sense of security, may exist, it believes that the harms of behavioral interventions are probably small to none.

	Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit

	Given the limited and inconsistent available evidence about the effectiveness of behavioral interventions to prevent or reduce illicit drug use and the nonmedical use of prescription medications, the USPSTF concludes that the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.

	Associated Issues

	Illicit drug and nonmedical pharmaceutical use is associated with alcohol and tobacco use in adolescents. Although it was once believed that tobacco and alcohol use were usually precursors to drug use, it is important to recognize that more adolescents use drugs than tobacco. Drugs, including illicit drugs, may be easier for U.S. adolescents to obtain than tobacco products. The strong association of use suggests that primary care professionals may want to screen for use of all 3 substances if they choose to screen for any. Because of the strong association among tobacco, alcohol, and drug use in adolescents, researchers should consider developing behavioral interventions to prevent and reduce use of all 3 substances. However, it is also possible that effective strategies for preventing and reducing use may need to be targeted, especially among different communities of adolescents and even for different drugs. Primary care professionals should remain aware of substance use patterns in their communities and the evolving evidence on effective prevention interventions.

	Response to Public Comment

	A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 1 October to 28 October 2013. All comments were reviewed and considered. Overall, most comments agreed that more evidence is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of behavioral interventions to reduce drug use. The recommendation statement was revised in response to comments seeking clarification of the terminology used and the patient population to whom the recommendation statement applies. A few comments requested that a future single recommendation statement be issued that includes alcohol, tobacco, and drug use in children and adolescents. The USPSTF currently has separate recommendation statements that address each substance and will consider concurrently updating recommendation statements that pertain to screening and interventions for all 3 areas in the future.",,Primary Care Behavioral Interventions to Reduce Illicit Drug and Nonmedical Pharmaceutical Use in Children and Adolescents,"Drug (Illicit) and Nonmedical Pharmaceutical Use in Children and Adolescents, Primary Care Behavioral Interventions, 2014"
"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to universal screening with formal screening instruments in community-dwelling adults in the general primary care population who are older than age 65 years and have no signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment. Early detection and diagnosis of dementia through the assessment of patient-, family-, or physician-recognized signs and symptoms, some of which may be subtle, are not considered screening and are not the focus of this recommendation.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<em>Potential Preventable Burden</em> <br /><br />The prevalence of dementia in the United States is 5% in persons aged 71 to 79 years, increasing to 24% in those aged 80 to 89 years and 37% in those older than 90 years. The prevalence of older adults with MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment)&nbsp;is difficult to estimate because of differences in the definition of MCI and methods used in studies; estimates range widely, from 3% to 42% in adults age 65 years and older. Approximately 40% to 50% of older adults report subjective memory symptoms. The rate of progression of MCI to dementia is uncertain. <br /><br />Although the evidence on routine screening is insufficient, there may be important reasons to identify early cognitive impairment. In addition to its potential to help patients make diagnostic and treatment decisions, including treatment of reversible causes of dementia and management of comorbid conditions, early recognition of cognitive impairment allows clinicians to anticipate problems patients may have in understanding and adhering to recommended therapy. This information may also be useful to patients and their caregivers and family members in anticipating and planning for future problems that may develop as a result of progression of cognitive impairment. Although the overall evidence on routine screening is insufficient, clinicians should remain alert to early signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment (for example, problems with memory or language) and evaluate as appropriate. The National Institute on Aging has information on the detection and management of cognitive impairment for patients and clinicians, including a database of tools to detect cognitive impairment (available at <a href=""http://www.nia.nih.gov/"">www.nia.nih.gov</a>). <br /><br /><em>Potential Harms</em> <br /><br />Information about the harms of screening, including labeling and the effect of false-positive results, is limited. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are associated with adverse effects, some of which are serious, including central nervous system disturbances and bradycardia. Gastrointestinal symptoms are also common. Information about the harms of nonpharmacologic interventions is limited, but these harms are assumed to be small. Exercise interventions are not associated with serious adverse effects. <br /><br /><em>Costs</em> <br /><br />The cost of screening varies depending on the screening instrument. Some instruments take little time and are free to the public. The most widely studied instrument, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), takes approximately 10 minutes to administer and is not free. Total health, long-term, and hospice care costs for dementia in the United States were an estimated $183 billion in 2011. Medicare and Medicaid pay approximately 40% to 70% of these costs, representing $130 billion. These costs do not include the estimated $202 billion in uncompensated care that informal caregivers provide annually. <br /><br /><em>Current Practice<br /><br /></em>At present, diagnosis of dementia primarily occurs as a result of a clinician's suspicion of patient symptoms or caregiver concerns and not as a result of routine formal screening. As much as 29% to 76% of patients with dementia or probable dementia in the primary care setting are undiagnosed. In 2011, Medicare added detection of cognitive impairment to the new annual wellness visit benefit, and the Alzheimer's Association has published guidance on how to implement this benefit.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
Increasing age is the strongest known risk factor for cognitive impairment. The &epsilon;4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene is a reported risk factor for Alzheimer disease. Other reported risk factors for cognitive impairment include cardiovascular risk factors (such as diabetes, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and the metabolic syndrome), head trauma, learning disabilities (such as Down syndrome), depression, alcohol abuse, physical frailty, low education level, low social support, and having never been married.<br /><br />Several dietary and lifestyle factors have been associated with decreased risk for dementia; these factors have weaker supporting evidence than those previously mentioned. Adequate folic acid intake, low saturated fat intake, longer-chain &omega;-3 fatty acids, high fruit and vegetable intake, Mediterranean diet, moderate alcohol intake, educational attainment, cognitive engagement, and participation in physical activity are all associated with decreased risk for dementia.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Screening tests for cognitive impairment in the clinical setting generally include asking patients to perform a series of tasks that assess at least 1 cognitive domain (memory, attention, language, and visuospatial or executive functioning). Blood tests and radiology examinations are not currently used as screening tests but are often used after a positive screening result to confirm the diagnosis of dementia and determine its subtype. Although optimum sensitivity and specificity of the MMSE probably vary depending on the patient's age and education level, a large body of literature suggests that a general cut point of 23/24 or 24/25 (score considered &ldquo;positive&rdquo;/&ldquo;negative&rdquo;) is appropriate for most primary care populations. <br /><br />Other instruments with more limited evidence include the Clock Drawing Test, Mini-Cog Test, Memory Impairment Screen, Abbreviated Mental Test, Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, 7-Minute Screen, Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status, and Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly. Each of these tests has reasonable performance in some studies, but estimates of sensitivity and specificity vary, and the optimum diagnostic threshold or cut point for many of these instruments is unclear. For information on all instruments reviewed by the USPSTF, including the Montreal Cognitive Screening Assessment, the St. Louis University Mental Status examination, and other instruments with 2 or fewer studies, see the full evidence report (available at <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">wwww.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).
<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>
Treatment of cognitive impairment focuses on several signs and symptoms, including quality-of-life, cognition, mood, and behavioral impairments.<br /><br />Several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions aim to prevent, slow, or reverse cognitive impairment in older adults or improve caregiver burden and depression. Pharmacologic treatments approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration include AChEIs and memantine. Nonpharmacologic interventions include cognitive training, lifestyle behavioral interventions, exercise, educational interventions, and multidisciplinary care interventions. Several interventions focus on the caregiver and aim to improve caregiver morbidity and delay institutionalization of persons with dementia.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
The USPSTF has published recommendations related to several of the risk factors for cognitive impairment, including counseling on tobacco cessation, alcohol use, healthful diet, physical activity, and falls prevention and screening for high cholesterol, hypertension, and depression (available at <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">wwww.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
More research on screening for and treatment of MCI is needed. Evidence on the effect of screening and early detection of mild to moderate dementia on decision making, planning, or other important patient outcomes is a critical gap in the evidence. Given the lack of evidence that treatment affects long-term cognitive outcomes for mild to moderate dementia, its effect on decision making and planning could be the most compelling reason for screening. However, no studies provided information on this effect. More research on the harms of screening is needed. Research on new interventions that address the changing needs of patients and families and interventions that clearly have an effect on the long-term clinical course of mild to moderate dementia are also critically needed.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf14/dementia/dementiafinalrs.htm#consider,141,"In 2011, Medicare began covering the detection of cognitive impairment as a part of the new annual wellness visit benefit. In 2013, the Alzheimer's Association published guidance on the detection of cognitive impairment during the annual wellness visit and recommended an algorithm involving a health risk assessment, patient observation, and unstructured questioning. The Alzheimer's Association recommends the use of a brief structured assessment (such as the General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition, Mini-Cog Test, Memory Impairment Screen, Alzheimer Disease 8-Item Informant Interview, or the short version of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly) if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment are present or if an informant is not available to confirm the absence of signs or symptoms.","Discussion

	Dementia is an acquired condition characterized by a decline in at least 2 cognitive domains (loss of memory, attention, language, and visuospatial or executive functioning) that is severe enough to affect social or occupational functioning7. Patients with dementia may also exhibit behavioral and psychological symptoms. The major dementia syndromes in older adults include Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson disease with dementia, and dementia of mixed cause (8). Mild cognitive impairment is different from dementia in that the cognitive impairment is not severe enough to interfere with instrumental activities of daily life.

	Dementia affects approximately 2.4 to 5.5 million Americans, but its prevalence is difficult to determine because of differences in definitions and populations used in studies (8–10). Age is the most important risk factor. Data from large population-based surveys indicate that the prevalence of dementia in the United States is 5% in persons aged 71 to 79 years, 24% in those aged 80 to 89 years, and 37% in those older than 90 years(8. Prevalence varies by race; prevalence in adults aged 71 years and older in 1 large study was 21.3% for blacks and 11.2% for whites11. The prevalence of Alzheimer disease in Hispanics is approximately 1.5 times that seen in the white population11–13. Dementia also affects more women than men. In persons aged 71 years and older, approximately 16% of women have dementia compared with 11% of men; these differences are primarily explained by women's longer life expectancy rather than any sex-based risk factors 14. Alzheimer disease accounts for 60% to 80% of all dementia, frontotemporal dementia accounts for 12% to 25%, 10% to 20% is considered vascular dementia, 5% to 10% is considered dementia with Lewy bodies, and 10% to 30% is considered dementia with mixed cause8, 10, 15 It is difficult to estimate the prevalence of MCI, and estimates range widely, from 3% to 42% in adults aged 65 years and older, depending on the population and diagnostic criteria used16, 17.

	Scope of Review

	In 2003, the USPSTF concluded that the evidence was insufficient to recommend for or against routine screening for dementia in older adults. To update its recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review of the evidence on screening for cognitive impairment, including dementia and MCI. The evidence review gathered evidence on the benefits, harms, and test performance of screening instruments to detect cognitive impairment in older adults and the benefits and harms of commonly used treatment and management options for older adults with MCI or early dementia and their caregivers. Important potential benefits included decision making, cognitive function, physical function, quality of life, safety, and caregiver burden. The USPSTF reviewed a significant amount of evidence, including available studies on caregiver burden and future planning (the full evidence report is available at wwww.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org)1. The review focused on screening adults in the general primary care population and management of screen-detected patients with cognitive impairment, excluding delirium. The review on treatment and management focused on studies of adults with mild to moderate dementia because these are the patients most likely to be identified by screening.

	Accuracy of Screening Tests

	The review identified 55 studies on instruments that screen for cognitive impairment. Forty-six of the studies provided evidence on the sensitivity and specificity of screening for dementia, and 27 provided evidence on MCI. Included studies had to use a diagnostic reference standard (such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third or Fourth Edition) or criteria from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (now known as the Alzheimer's Association). These studies were conducted in primary care–relevant populations, and most instruments were brief (≤10 minutes) and administered in a clinical setting. Studies on self-administered instruments were also reviewed.

	Screening instruments evaluated in more than 2 studies include the MMSE, Clock Drawing Test, verbal fluency tests, Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, Memory Impairment Screen, Mini-Cog Test, Abbreviated Mental Test, and Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire. The MMSE was the most evaluated instrument, with 25 published studies. The MMSE is a 30-point instrument with 11 items. It has been studied in various populations; the mean age of participants ranged from 69 to 95 years, the mean prevalence of dementia ranged from 1.2% to 38.0%, and education level also varied widely but was not always reported. For the most commonly reported cut points (23/24 or 24/25 [score considered “positive”/“negative”]), the pooled sensitivity from 14 studies (involving 10,185 participants) was 88.3% (95% CI, 81.3% to 92.9%) and specificity was 86.2% (95% CI, 81.8% to 89.7%)1, 2. The other instruments were studied in far fewer studies (4 to 7 studies each), had limited reproducibility in primary care–relevant populations, and had unknown optimum cut points. Sensitivity and specificity ranged widely in these studies.

	Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment

	No trials evaluated the direct effect of screening for cognitive impairment by comparing screened and unscreened older adults and reporting important patient outcomes, including decision-making outcomes. The review identified more than 130 studies on several interventions for managing or treating mild to moderate dementia, including pharmacologic and nonpharmacological interventions. Pharmacologic interventions included U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved medications for the treatment of Alzheimer disease with the purpose of preventing or delaying cognitive impairment (AChEIs and memantine), medications for cardiovascular risk reduction for vascular dementia, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, gonadal steroids, and dietary supplements. The review also considered evidence on nonpharmacologic interventions, including interventions aimed primarily at the caregiver or patient–caregiver dyad and at the patient (such as cognitive training, rehabilitation, or stimulation, with or without motor skills training interventions; exercise interventions; multidisciplinary care interventions involving assessment and care coordination; and education-only interventions).

	Fifty-four trials provided evidence on AChEIs for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and tacrine), including 4 trials of persons with MCI. Ten additional trials reported on memantine in persons with moderate dementia. Many studies reported differences in scores on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale–Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog). The ADAS-cog is a validated instrument that assesses memory, attention, orientation, language, and praxis. Scores range from 0 to 70, with higher scores signifying greater cognitive impairment; a change of 4 points or more is commonly accepted to be clinically significant for patients with mild to moderate dementia. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine improved global cognitive function by approximately 1- to 3-point differences on the ADAS-cog. A meta-analysis of 7 rivastigmine trials reported a 3-point difference on the ADAS-cog (−3.06 [95% CI, −4.48 to −1.65]; I2 = 92.6%). Only 4 trials were conducted in persons with MCI and reported global cognitive function18–21. These trials of donepezil and galantamine generally showed a small but unclear clinical effect on global cognitive function. Only one half of the trials reported global physical function; findings were inconsistent and sparsely reported. Few studies reported outcomes beyond 6 months. Longer-term studies were generally consistent with studies of shorter duration and demonstrated statistically significant small improvements of unknown clinical importance.

	The review considered 26 studies that evaluated other medications or supplements, including low-dose aspirin, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (or “statins”), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, gonadal steroids, and dietary supplements, and did not find any evidence that these medications or supplements provided a benefit in global cognitive or physical function in persons with mild to moderate dementia or MCI1.

	The review identified 59 studies that evaluated the effect of nonpharmacological interventions aimed at the caregiver or both the patient and caregiver. Most of these trials evaluated interventions that included an educational component designed to increase caregiver skills. Although the approaches to education in the interventions varied, there was a generally consistent finding of a small benefit on caregiver burden and depression outcomes in persons caring for patients with moderate dementia. The clinical meaning of the changes in caregiver burden and depression is unknown but on average is probably small at best. Ten studies on exercise interventions were reviewed; the clinical effect of these results on important outcomes is uncertain because of the limited number of trials and variability in studied populations, exercise interventions, and reported outcomes.

	Fifteen cognitive intervention trials provided somewhat inconsistent evidence that cognitive stimulation with or without cognitive training seems to improve global cognitive function measures in the short term for persons with MCI or dementia. However, the magnitude and certainty of the clinical benefit is difficult to determine because of the limited number of trials, clinical and statistical heterogeneity combined, and imprecision of results.

	Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment

	No studies reported on direct or indirect harms from false-positive or false-negative results, psychological harms, unnecessary diagnostic testing, or labeling. One study provided some information on the potential harms of screening for cognitive impairment in primary care. In this study of 3573 older adults, approximately one half of patients who had a positive screening result for cognitive impairment (207 out of 434 patients) declined a formal diagnostic work-up for dementia. Only 233 out of 3573 participants initially declined to be screened22, 23.

	Adverse effects from AChEIs are common. Withdrawal or discontinuation rates in studies of AChEIs were 14% for donepezil and rivastigmine and 17% for galantamine. Serious adverse effects from these medications seem to occur with similar frequency across the different AChEIs. Bradycardia and adverse effects related to bradycardia (such as falls and syncope) may result from taking AChEIs. Tacrine, which had very high discontinuation rates in trials, has an uncommon but serious adverse effect of liver toxicity. Tacrine is no longer used in the United States for this reason. In trials, memantine did not differ from placebo in the percentage of withdrawals from medication due to adverse or serious adverse effects. Evidence on the harms of nonpharmacologic interventions in patients with dementia or their caregivers is limited.

	Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit

	The USPSTF found no evidence on the direct benefits and harms of screening for cognitive impairment and therefore considered the indirect evidence on screening accuracy, early treatment, and harms. Evidence is adequate that some screening tools can accurately identify dementia. Treatment of mild to moderate dementia with several drug therapies and nonpharmacologic interventions results in small improvements in measures of cognitive function and caregiver outcomes, but the clinical significance of these improvements is uncertain. The USPSTF found no published evidence on the effect of screening on decision making or planning by patients, clinicians, or caregivers. Evidence on the harms of screening and nonpharmacologic interventions is inadequate. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that AChEIs are associated with adverse effects, some of which are serious. Overall, the USPSTF was unable to estimate the balance of benefits and harms of screening for cognitive impairment.

	How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?

	Dementia is the manifestation of various pathophysiologic changes in the brain; therefore, the development of early interventions that result in an important clinical effect on all types of dementia is difficult. The exact causal mechanism for many types of dementia is unknown. Most dementia in the United States is a result of Alzheimer disease, which is the target of most U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved drugs for dementia. Given that current therapies for dementia do not seem to affect the long-term progression of mild to moderate cognitive impairment, the hope is for effective interventions that can help patients and caregivers prepare for dealing with dementia symptoms.

	Response to Public Comment

	A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 5 November to 2 December 2013. Several comments agreed with the insufficiency of the evidence. A few comments disagreed with the recommendation, and some comments expressed confusion about the meaning of an I statement and how it may affect early detection. The recommendation contains suggestions for practice regarding the I statement and notes that, although evidence on routine screening is insufficient, there may be important reasons to identify early cognitive impairment in specific circumstances. Other comments requested clarification on the meaning of screening and for whom the recommendation is intended; in response, information was added to the recommendation. A few comments provided evidence on additional risk factors for cognitive impairment and suggested additional research gaps; these were added to the Clinical Considerations section. The importance of vascular causes of dementia was mentioned in a few comments, and information on USPSTF recommendations related to vascular risk factors was added.",,Screening for Cognitive Impairment,"Cognitive Impairment, Screening, 2014"
"<h3><a id=""consider"" name=""consider""></a>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
<p>This recommendation applies to community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are not known to have osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency.</p>
<h3>Brief Risk Assessment</h3>
<p>When determining to whom these recommendations apply, primary care clinicians can reasonably consider a small number of risk factors to identify older adults who are at increased risk for falls. Age is strongly related to risk for falls. Studies most commonly used a history of falls to identify increased risk for future falls; history of falls is generally considered together or sequentially with other key risk factors, particularly impairments in mobility, gait, and balance. A pragmatic approach to identifying persons at high risk for falls, consistent with the enrollment criteria for intervention trials, would be to assess for a history of falls or for problems in physical functioning and limited mobility. Clinicians could also use assessments of gait and mobility, such as the Timed Up and Go test.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation5""><span style=""font-size: small;"">5-7</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Interventions</h3>
<h4>Exercise Interventions</h4>
<p>Effective exercise interventions include supervised individual and group classes and physical therapy, although most studies reviewed by the USPSTF included group exercise. Given the heterogeneity of interventions reviewed by the USPSTF, it is difficult to identify specific components of exercise that are particularly efficacious. The most common exercise component was gait, balance, and functional training (17 trials), followed by resistance training (13 trials), flexibility (8 trials), and endurance training (5 trials). Three studies included tai chi, and 5 studies included general physical activity. The most common frequency and duration for exercise interventions was 3 sessions per week for 12 months, although duration of exercise interventions ranged from 2 to 42 months.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation8""><span style=""font-size: small;"">8</span></a></sup> The 2008 US Department of Health and Human Services guidelines recommended that older adults get at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, as well as muscle-strengthening activities twice per week.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation9""><span style=""font-size: small;"">9</span></a></sup> It also recommended performing balance training on 3 or more days per week for older adults at risk for falls because of a recent fall or difficulty walking.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation9""><span style=""font-size: small;"">9</span></a></sup></p>
<h4>Multifactorial Interventions</h4>
<p>Multifactorial interventions include an initial assessment of modifiable risk factors for falls and subsequent customized interventions for each patient based on issues identified in the initial assessment. The initial assessment could include a multidisciplinary comprehensive geriatric assessment or an assessment using a combination of various components, such as balance, gait, vision, postural blood pressure, medication, environment, cognition, and psychological health. In studies, nursing staff usually performed the assessment, and a number of different professionals performed subsequent interventions, including nurses, clinicians, physical therapists, exercise instructors, occupational therapists, dieticians, or nutritionists. Intervention components vary based on the initial assessment and could include group or individual exercise, psychological interventions (cognitive behavioral therapy), nutrition therapy, education, medication management, urinary incontinence management, environmental modification, physical or occupational therapy, social or community services, and referral to specialists (eg, ophthalmologist, neurologist, or cardiologist). For additional details on multifactorial interventions reviewed by the USPSTF, please see the full evidence report.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation8""><span style=""font-size: small;"">8</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation10"">10</a></sup></span></p>
<h4>Other Interventions</h4>
<p>The following single interventions lack sufficient evidence for or against their use to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults when offered alone and not in the context of a multifactorial intervention: environmental modification, medication management, psychological interventions, and combination interventions not customized to an individual risk profile.</p>
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
<p>Fractures are an important injury associated with falls, and the USPSTF has issued 2 related recommendation statements on the prevention of fractures. The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis in women 65 years or older and in younger women at increased risk.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation11""><span style=""font-size: small;"">11</span></a></sup> In its recommendation on vitamin D and calcium supplementation to prevent fractures, the USPSTF states that it found insufficient evidence on vitamin D or calcium supplementation to prevent fractures in men, premenopausal women at any dose, and in postmenopausal women at doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D and greater than 1000 mg of calcium; the USPSTF recommends against supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D or 1000 mg or less of calcium in postmenopausal women.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation12""><span style=""font-size: small;"">12</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published guidance on implementing community-based interventions to prevent falls.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation13""><span style=""font-size: small;"">13</span></a></sup></p>",,191,"<h3>Other Considerations</h3>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Although the evidence does not support routinely performing an in-depth multifactorial risk assessment with comprehensive management in all older adults, there may be reasons for providing this service to certain patients. Important items in the patient's medical history could include the circumstances of prior falls and the presence of comorbid medical conditions. The American Geriatric Society (AGS) recommends multifactorial risk assessment with multicomponent interventions in older adults who have had 2 falls in the past year (1 fall if combined with gait or balance problems), have gait or balance problems, or present with an acute fall.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation14""><span style=""font-size: small;"">14</span></a></sup> According to the AGS, evaluation of balance and mobility, vision, and orthostatic or postural hypotension are effective components of multifactorial risk assessment with comprehensive management, as well as review of medication use and home environment.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation14""><span style=""font-size: small;"">14</span></a></sup> Follow-up and comprehensive management of identified risk factors are essential to the effectiveness of this strategy.</p>
<p>The burden of falls on patients and the health care system is large. Reducing the incidence of falls would also improve the socialization and functioning of older adults who have previously fallen and fear falling again. Many other interventions could potentially be useful to prevent falls, but because of the heterogeneity in the target patient population, heterogeneity (ie, multiplicity) of predisposing factors, and their additive or synergistic nature, the effectiveness of other interventions is not known. However, many interventions with insufficient evidence to support their use to prevent falls have other arguments that support their use.</p>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
<p>Studies are needed on the clinical validation of primary care tools to identify older adults at increased risk for falls. More efficacy trials are needed on how the following interventions may help prevent falls if offered alone and not as part of multifactorial interventions: environmental modification, medication management, and psychological interventions. Additional research is needed on the effectiveness of interventions in different age groups, in particular adults older than 85 years. Additional research to identify effective components of exercise interventions would also be useful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations of Others</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute on Aging outlines similar interventions for the prevention of falls: exercise for strength and balance, monitoring for environmental hazards, regular medical care to ensure optimized hearing and vision, and medication management.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation30""><span style=""font-size: small;"">30</span></a></sup> According to the AGS, detecting a history of falls is fundamental to a falls reduction program, and it recommends asking all older adults once a year about falls.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation14""><span style=""font-size: small;"">14</span></a></sup> The AGS further recommends that older persons who have experienced a fall should have their gait and balance assessed using one of the available evaluations; those who cannot perform or perform poorly on a standardized gait and balance test should be given a multifactorial falls risk assessment that includes a focused medical history, physical examination, functional assessment, and an environmental assessment. The AGS also recommends the following interventions for falls prevention: adaptation or modification of home environment; withdrawal or minimization of psychoactive or other medications; management of postural hypotension; management of foot problems and footwear; exercise (particularly balance), strength, and gait training; and vitamin D supplementation of at least 800 IU per day for persons with vitamin D deficiency or who are at increased risk for falls. The AGS found insufficient evidence to recommend vision screening alone as a single intervention for falls prevention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends STEADI, a coordinated approach to implementing the AGS clinical practice guidelines for falls prevention that consists of 3 core elements: screen to identify fall risk, assess modifiable risk factors, and intervene using effective clinical and community strategies to reduce the identified risk. Clinical strategies include but are not limited to physical therapy and medication management. Community strategies include but are not limited to evidence-based exercise programs and home modification.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation31""><span style=""font-size: small;"">31</span></a></sup> Similar to the 2012 USPSTF recommendation, the American Academy of Family Physicians recommends exercise or physical therapy and vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are at increased risk for falls. It does not recommend automatically performing an in-depth multifactorial risk assessment in conjunction with comprehensive management of identified risks.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation32""><span style=""font-size: small;"">32</span></a></sup></p>

<p><strong><sup><span style=""font-size: small;"">Update of Previous</span></sup></strong><sup><span style=""font-size: small;""> Recommendation</span></sup></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">The USPSTF last issued a recommendation on interventions to prevent falls in older adults in 2012. At that time, consistent with the current recommendation statement, the USPSTF recommended exercise (B recommendation) and selectively offering multifactorial interventions (C recommendation) to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults at increased risk for falls. At that time, the USPSTF also recommended vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls (B recommendation), based on previous evidence that found a reduction in the number of persons experiencing a fall. The current review excluded studies considered in the previous review that enrolled persons with vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency because, on further consideration, vitamin D supplementation in these examined additional fall-related outcomes, including incident falls (in addition to the number of persons experiencing a fall, which was considered in the previous review). With this revised scope of review, as well as newer evidence from trials reporting no benefit, the USPSTF found that vitamin D supplementation has no benefit in falls prevention in community-dwelling older adults not known to have vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. Thus, the USPSTF now recommends against vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of falls in community-dwelling older adults.</span></p>","Burden of Disease
In 2014, approximately 2.8 million older adults sought treatment in emergency departments for falls; approximately 800,000 of older adults experiencing a fall were hospitalized, and more than 27,000 older adults died from a fall.1, 15 More than 90% of hip fractures are caused by falls, and 25% of older adults who sustain a hip fracture die within 6 months.16, 17 Risk for falls increases with age; in 2014, 27% of adults aged 65 to 74 years and 37% of adults 85 years or older reported a fall.1
Scope of Review
The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review on the effectiveness and harms of primary care–relevant interventions to prevent falls and fall-related morbidity and mortality in community-dwelling older adults 65 years or older.8, 10 Although the review evaluated risk-assessment approaches used in studies to identify patients at increased risk for falls, it did not evaluate the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening all patients for falls risk factors (ie, did not compare health outcomes in screened vs unscreened groups). Studies conducted solely in populations with specific medical diagnoses that could affect fall-related outcomes or for which interventions could be considered disease management (eg, osteoporosis, vitamin D deficiency, visual impairment, and neurocognitive disorders) were excluded. This systematic evidence review updates the 2010 review and varies from the previous review in a few ways: additional falls outcomes, such as number of falls and injurious falls, were included, and studies of vitamin D supplementation conducted in populations known to be vitamin D deficient were excluded.
Brief Risk Assessment
The majority of intervention studies (40/62) reviewed by the USPSTF targeted patients at high risk for falls.8, 10 However, studies used variable approaches to identify high-risk patients. Most commonly, studies used history of prior falls to identify persons at high risk for future falls (16 studies).8 Other trials evaluated 2 or more risk factors, such as history of prior falls, difficulty with mobility, and use of health care, and included participants with any of these risk factors. Studies that evaluated exercise interventions most commonly used physical function or mobility limitation problems to identify high-risk populations. Therefore, history of prior falls or physical function or mobility limitation problems may be adequate and appropriate factors for determining high risk.
Effectiveness of Preventive Measures
The USPSTF reviewed the evidence from 62 trials on the use of multifactorial interventions, exercise, vitamin D supplementation, environmental modifications, psychological interventions, and multiple interventions to prevent falls and fall-related morbidity and mortality.8, 10 The USPSTF focused on the outcomes of reductions in falls, number of persons experiencing a fall, reductions in injurious falls, and number of persons experiencing an injurious fall. Although many studies reported on mortality, they were generally underpowered to detect changes in mortality, and results were not statistically significant. The most commonly reported outcomes were falls and number of persons experiencing a fall; half (31/62) of the trials were powered to detect clinically meaningful differences in these 2 outcomes. The most commonly reported interventions included multifactorial interventions (26 trials), exercise (21 trials), and vitamin D supplementation (7 trials).
Exercise Interventions
The USPSTF found 5 good-quality and 16 fair-quality studies (n=7297) reporting on various exercise interventions to prevent falls.8, 10 A little more than half of studies (12/21) recruited populations at high risk for falls. Physical function/mobility limitation problems, measured objectively or self-reported by participants, was the most common risk factor used to identify persons at high risk. The number of study participants ranged from 55 to 1635, and the mean age ranged from 68 to 88 years. Six studies were conducted exclusively in women; women comprised the majority of participants in the other studies, except for 1 study in which 42% of participants were women. Only 3 studies reported the race/ethnicity of study participants, who were almost exclusively white. Three studies were conducted in the United States, 1 study in the United Kingdom, 8 studies in other parts of Europe, 7 studies in Australia or New Zealand, and 2 studies in Asia.
Studies found that exercise improved several fall-related outcomes. Based on pooled analyses of 15 studies (n=4926), exercise interventions reduced the number of persons experiencing a fall (relative risk [RR], 0.89 [95% CI, 0.81 to 0.97]).8 Pooled analyses from 10 studies (n=4622) found a reduction in the number of injurious falls experienced by participants undergoing exercise interventions (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.81 [95% CI, 0.73 to 0.90]).8 Although not statistically significant, pooled analyses of 14 studies (n=4663) revealed a reduction in the number of falls experienced by participants undergoing exercise interventions (IRR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.75 to 1.00]).8 Some initial, exploratory analyses suggest that group-based exercise (vs individual-based exercise), multiple exercise components (vs single exercise component), and interventions including strength or resistance exercises (vs interventions without those components) were more likely to be associated with a greater reduction in falls and number of persons experiencing a fall. However, given that these findings were only exploratory analyses to evaluate causes of heterogeneity, they should be interpreted with caution.8 Additional details about specific exercise interventions reviewed by the USPSTF can be found in the full evidence report.8
Multifactorial Interventions
Seven good-quality and 19 fair-quality studies (n=15,506) reported on multifactorial interventions.8, 10 Most studies (19/26) recruited participants at high risk for falls. Although studies used various assessment approaches, history of falls was the most common risk factor used to identify persons at high risk. The number of participants ranged from 100 to 5310, and the mean age ranged from 71.9 to 85.0 years. The percentage of women ranged from 53.2% to 94.0%. Race/ethnicity of study participants was reported in only 1 study, in which 94% of participants were white. Three studies were conducted in the United States; the remaining studies were conducted in the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, Canada, Spain, Finland, Denmark, Switzerland, Sweden, and New Zealand.
While studies found that multifactorial interventions reduced the number of falls, these interventions did not appear to improve other fall-related outcomes. Pooled analyses found reductions in the number of falls among participants who received multifactorial interventions (IRR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.68 to 0.91]; 17 studies; n=9737) but not in the number of persons experiencing a fall (RR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.89 to 1.01]; 24 studies; n=12,490) or experiencing an injurious fall (RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.85 to 1.03]; 16 studies; n=9,445).8 Of 9 studies (n=4306) reporting the number of injurious falls, only 1 reported a statistically significant reduction among participants receiving multifactorial interventions.8 Given that studies used heterogeneous multifactorial interventions, it is difficult to identify specific components that may be effective. The initial assessment to screen for modifiable falls risk factors used either a multidisciplinary comprehensive geriatric assessment or a specific falls risk assessment that evaluated any of the following: balance, gait, vision, cardiovascular health, medication, environment, cognition, and psychological health. Treatment interventions varied substantially across studies and included targeted combinations of any of the following components: exercise, psychological interventions, nutrition therapy, knowledge, medication management, urinary incontinence management, environmental modification, and referrals to physical or occupational therapy, social or community services, or specialists (eg, ophthalmologist, neurologist, or cardiologist). Most studies referred participants to or offered an exercise or physical therapy intervention. The majority of studies included home visits for the initial assessment, environmental modification, or physical therapy or exercise interventions; other services were conducted in outpatient settings. Total contact time was rarely reported, precluding quantification of intervention intensity.
Vitamin D Supplementation
Four good-quality and 3 fair-quality studies (n=7531) reported on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of falls in community-dwelling older adults.8, 10 Three studies recruited participants at high risk for falls, most commonly based on a history of falls. Baseline mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels ranged from 26.4 to 31.8 ng/mL, which correspond with National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data on vitamin D levels in adults 60 years or older. The number of participants ranged from 204 to 3314, and the mean age ranged from 71.0 to 76.8 years. Five studies were conducted exclusively in women; women comprised approximately half of the study population in the other 2 studies. Only 3 studies reported the race/ethnicity of participants, who were almost exclusively white. Two trials were conducted in the United States, 2 in Australia, and 1 each in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Finland.
Five trials (n=3496) reported mixed findings.8 Only 1 trial showed a statistically significant reduction in falls;8, 18 however, another study using high doses of vitamin D (500,000 IU per year) showed a statistically significant increase in falls (8, 19). Pooled analyses showed neither a significant reduction in falls (IRR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.79 to 1.20]; 5 studies; n=3496) nor a significant effect on the number of persons experiencing a fall with vitamin D supplementation (RR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.08]).8 Only 2 trials reported on the number of injurious falls; 1 trial using an annual high dose of vitamin D reported an increase in injurious falls (IRR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.02 to 1.29]),8, 19 and the other trial reported no statistically significant difference (IRR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.45 to 1.57]).8, 20 Only 1 trial reported on fractures and found a nonsignificant increase in fractures with vitamin D supplementation (IRR, 1.25 [95% CI, 0.97 to 1.61]).19 Four trials reported mixed results on the number of persons experiencing a fracture.8 Vitamin D formulations and dosages varied among trials. Five trials used cholecalciferol at doses of 700 IU per day, 800 IU per day, 150,000 IU every 3 months, or 500,000 IU per year; 1 trial used 1-hydroxycholecalciferol (1 μg per day) and another used calcitriol (0.25 μg twice per day).8
Other Interventions
The USPSTF found evidence on other interventions, including environmental modification (3 studies; n=2175), medication management (2 studies; n=266), psychological interventions (2 studies; n=929), and multiple interventions (6 studies; n=1770).8 Multiple interventions provided at least 2 intervention components but were not customized to individual participants. Studies of these other interventions were too few, too small, and too heterogeneous for the USPSTF to draw any definitive conclusions.
Other Outcomes
The effect of interventions to prevent falls on functional status or quality of life remains uncertain. The few trials reporting quality of life, activities of daily living, or independent activities of daily living showed no benefit, but these studies used different scales, and few were adequately powered to detect differences in these outcomes.
Potential Harms of Preventive Measures
Evidence on harms was reported in a subset of trials reporting on the effectiveness of interventions. Eight studies (n=4107) evaluating exercise interventions reported on harms; in general, adverse events were minor.8, 10 The most common adverse events included pain or bruising related to exercise. One study reported 1 wrist fracture in the intervention group21 and another study reported a rate of 2.6 serious fall injuries per 100,000 physical activity sessions.22 Only 2 trials reported on harms in control groups for comparison and found no between-group difference in the rate of serious injuries.8 For multifactorial interventions, 4 studies (n=1466) reported on harms.8 In general, reported harms were rare, minor, and associated with the exercise component of the intervention. Five studies (n=3955) on vitamin D supplementation reported no difference in the frequency of harms between intervention and control groups.8 However, as mentioned previously, the study using the highest dose of vitamin D (500,000 IU per year) reported an increase in falls, injurious falls, and the number of persons experiencing falls.19 Other reported harms were rare and included kidney stones, diabetes, transient hypercalcemia, and hypercalciuria; it was unclear if these rare harms were attributable to vitamin D supplementation. However, in a separate evidence review commissioned by the USPSTF on vitamin D supplementation to prevent fractures, the incidence of kidney stones increased with combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation (based on evidence from 3 studies, including the large Women’s Health Initiative trial).23, 24 Three studies (n=810) on multiple interventions reported no adverse or severe adverse events, although ascertainment of adverse events was unclear.8 One study on a single psychological intervention reported no adverse events.25 The remaining studies did not report on harms or adverse events.
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF found adequate evidence that exercise reduces the risk for falls by a moderate amount. Studies found reductions across several fall-related outcomes. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the harms of exercise as no greater than small. Potential harms include pain and bruising from exercise or a paradoxical increase in falls. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that exercise confers a moderate net benefit in the reduction of falls.
The USPSTF found adequate evidence that multifactorial interventions reduce the risk for falls by a small amount. Pooled analyses revealed statistically significant reductions in 1 fall-related outcome (number of falls) but not others (eg, number of persons experiencing a fall). The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the harms of multifactorial interventions as no greater than small. Most reported harms seem to arise from the exercise components of interventions. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that multifactorial interventions confer a small net benefit in the reduction of falls.
The USPSTF found adequate evidence that vitamin D supplementation does not prevent falls. Pooled analyses show no effect of vitamin D supplementation on the number of falls or the number of persons experiencing a fall. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of vitamin D supplementation are small to moderate. A study of annual high-dose vitamin D supplementation showed an increase in falls. Adequate evidence from a separate evidence review on vitamin D supplementation found an increase in the incidence of kidney stones with combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that vitamin D supplementation offers no net benefit in the reduction of falls.
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
Muscle weakness, gait disturbances, and imbalance are important factors that contribute to increased risk for falls in older persons. Exercise and physical therapy may improve strength and balance and therefore may result in fewer falls. Many interrelated variables affect the health status of older adults, some of which probably have additive effects and may explain why multifactorial risk assessment with comprehensive management is effective in preventing falls. Vitamin D receptors have been identified in various cell types, including skeletal muscle, and stimulation of these receptors promotes protein synthesis.26, 27 Although it has been previously demonstrated that vitamin D or its metabolites may have a beneficial effect on muscle strength and balance,28 the current evidence shows no benefit in preventing falls. In addition, the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) concluded that there may be a potential U-shaped relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum levels and health outcomes, with serum levels greater than 125 nmol/L being associated with worse health outcomes.29
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from September 26, 2017, to October 24, 2017. In response to public comment, the USPSTF clarified that physical therapy, which was described separately from exercise interventions in the 2012 recommendation, is now included among “exercise interventions” in the current recommendation. Additionally, the USPSTF clarified that these recommendations apply to older adults not known to be vitamin D deficient. The USPSTF added findings on additional outcomes, such as quality of life, as well. A few comments requested additional details about effective exercise and multifactorial interventions. Given the heterogeneity of included interventions, it is difficult for the USPSTF to identify specific components that it found to be particularly effective; however, the USPSTF included results from some exploratory analyses. A few comments also requested a recommendation on other interventions, such as reducing medication prescriptions and comprehensive eye examination. The USPSTF can only recommend the use of an intervention when it finds adequate evidence that the benefits outweigh the harms. Although the USPSTF may have reviewed additional interventions, it did not find adequate evidence to issue a recommendation on all of the reviewed interventions. Interventions that target health conditions that may affect falls risk but have other reasons for assessment and treatment (such as visual impairment or neurologic disorders) were considered to be out of scope for the current review. Information on all the interventions reviewed by the USPSTF can be found in the full evidence report.8","<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Falls are the leading cause of injury-related morbidity and mortality among older adults in the United States.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup> In 2014, 28.7% of community-dwelling adults 65 years or older reported falling, resulting in 29 million falls (37.5% of which needed medical treatment or restricted activity for a day or longer)<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation2""><span style=""font-size: small;"">2</span></a></sup> and an estimated 33,000 deaths in 2015.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1-4</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>Effective primary care interventions to prevent falls use various approaches to identify persons at increased risk. However, no instrument has been clearly identified as accurate and feasible for identifying older adults at increased risk for falls. Although many studies used a variety of risk factors functional tests, or both involving gait, balance, or mobility to identify study participants, history of falls was the most commonly used factor that consistently identified persons at high risk for falls.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Early Intervention</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that exercise interventions have a moderate benefit in preventing falls in older adults at increased risk for falls. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that multifactorial interventions have a small benefit in preventing falls in older adults at increased risk for falls. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that vitamin D supplementation has no benefit in preventing falls in older adults.</p>
<h3>Harms of Early Intervention</h3>
<p>Based on the noninvasive nature of most of the interventions, the low likelihood of serious harms, and the available information from studies reporting few serious harms, the USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the harms of exercise and multifactorial interventions as no greater than small. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the overall harms of vitamin D supplementation are small to moderate; evidence suggests that the harms of vitamin D supplementation at very high dosages may be moderate.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>

<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that multifactorial interventions provide a small net benefit in preventing falls in older adults at increased risk for falls.</p>

"There are no validated methods of identifying women at high risk for preeclampsia on the basis of biomarkers, clinical diagnostic tests, or medical history. Most clinicians use medical history to identify women at high risk. Risk factors, based on medical history, may help guide clinicians and their patients in the decision to begin aspirin use. <br /><br />Although clinical risk assessments were not systematically reviewed for this recommendation, a pragmatic approach is described in the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/low-dose-aspirin-use-for-the-prevention-of-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preeclampsia-preventive-medication#tab"">Table</a>. This approach may help to identify a patient population with an absolute risk for preeclampsia of at least 8%, which is consistent with the lowest preeclampsia incidence observed in control groups in studies reviewed by the USPSTF. Women with 1 or more high-risk factors should receive low-dose aspirin. Women with several moderate-risk factors may also benefit from low-dose aspirin (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/low-dose-aspirin-use-for-the-prevention-of-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preeclampsia-preventive-medication#tab"">Table</a>), but the evidence is less certain for this approach.

These risk factors are independently associated with moderate risk for preeclampsia, some more consistently than others.<br />&sect; Moderate-risk factors vary in their association with increased risk for preeclampsia.
<h3>Assessment of Risk for Adverse Effects</h3>
Low-dose aspirin use in women at increased risk for preeclampsia has not been shown to increase the occurrence of placental abruption; postpartum hemorrhage; or fetal harms, such as intracranial bleeding and congenital anomalies.
<h3>Use of Preventive Medication</h3>
The dosage and timing of initiation of low-dose aspirin varied across studies. However, the beneficial effects and small harms of low-dose aspirin were consistent across dosages and timing of initiation. It was not possible to determine from the evidence whether a specific dosage or timing of aspirin use conferred greater benefit over other dosages or intervals.
<h4>Dosage</h4>
Low-dose aspirin at dosages between 60 and 150 mg/d reduced the occurrence of preeclampsia, preterm birth, and IUGR in women at increased risk for preeclampsia in several randomized trials. The most commonly used dosage was 100 mg/d, but the 2 largest trials contributing to the estimates of benefit used 60 mg/d. Although studies did not evaluate a dosage of 81 mg/d, low-dose aspirin is available in the United States as 81-mg tablets, which is a reasonable dosage for prophylaxis in women at high risk for preeclampsia.
<h4>Timing</h4>
Use of low-dose aspirin was initiated between 12 and 28 weeks of gestation. Evidence did not suggest additional benefit when use of aspirin was started earlier (12 to 16 weeks) rather than later (&ge;16 weeks) in pregnancy in women at increased risk for preeclampsia.<br /><br />
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Research is needed on the effect of low-dose aspirin on the development of preeclampsia and how the magnitude of response to low-dose aspirin varies with individual or combined risk factors for preeclampsia. Research on how to improve clinicians' ability to identify women at increased risk for preeclampsia, particularly those who would receive the greatest benefit from aspirin as preventive medication, is also needed. Efforts to validate the effectiveness of risk assessment tools using clinical history alone or combined with clinical testing may help clinicians better identify high-risk women who will benefit from aspirin as preventive medication, and help reduce the incidence of preeclampsia and its consequent outcomes. <br /><br />Further research in populations that bear the highest disease burden for preeclampsia, including African American and nulliparous women, is needed. Multivariable risk prediction models that identify healthy nulliparous women who are likely to develop preeclampsia are in development, but further refinement and validation are needed. Additional research to further assess preeclampsia risk in pregnant women with 1 or more moderate-risk factors is needed. Future trials should recruit adequate numbers of women from racial/ethnic populations that are at disproportionate risk, such as African American women, in order to have sufficient power to determine the effectiveness of different aspirin dosages and timing of initiation in these high-risk groups. <br /><br />Larger studies investigating aspirin use in the first or early second trimester may improve the evidence base on optimal timing of low-dose aspirin as preventive medication. Other areas of research include optimal therapies that individualize the aspirin dosage and timing of administration (e.g., morning vs. bedtime). <br /><br />In addition, studies that explore less well-established risk factors that may better identify women at high risk for preeclampsia are needed. Further research should also investigate whether preeclampsia prevention with low-dose aspirin affects women's long-term risk for cardiovascular disease and whether there are benefits to continuing low-dose aspirin after delivery in women with 1 or more high-risk factors.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
The USPSTF recommends that all women planning or capable of pregnancy take a daily supplement containing 0.4 to 0.8 mg (400 to 800 &micro;g) of folic acid. More information is available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/low-dose-aspirin-use-for-the-prevention-of-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preeclampsia-preventive-medication,148,"The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends initiating use of low-dose aspirin (60 to 80 mg/d) during the late first trimester to prevent preeclampsia in women with a medical history of early-onset preeclampsia and preterm delivery (&lt;34 weeks) or history of preeclampsia in more than 1 previous pregnancy. <br /><br />The World Health Organization recommends the use of low-dose aspirin (75 mg/d) starting as early as 12 to 20 weeks of gestation for high-risk women (i.e., those with a history of preeclampsia, diabetes, chronic hypertension, renal or autoimmune disease, or multifetal pregnancies). It states that there is limited evidence regarding the benefits of low-dose aspirin in other subgroups of high-risk women. <br /><br />The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends that women at high risk for preeclampsia (i.e., women with a history of hypertension in a previous pregnancy, chronic kidney disease, autoimmune disease, type 1 or 2 diabetes, or chronic hypertension) take 75 mg/d of aspirin from 12 weeks until delivery. It recommends the same for women with more than 1 moderate-risk factor (first pregnancy, age &ge;40 years, pregnancy interval &gt;10 years, body mass index &ge;35 kg/m2, family history of preeclampsia, or multifetal pregnancies).<br /><br />The American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association recommend that women with chronic primary or secondary hypertension or previous pregnancy-related hypertension take low-dose aspirin from 12 weeks until delivery. <br /><br />The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) after 12 weeks of gestation in women who are at high risk for preeclampsia.","Burden of Disease

	Preeclampsia is a multisystem inflammatory syndrome with an unclear etiology and natural history. It is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and the second-leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide1.

	In 2010, preeclampsia affected 3.8% of deliveries in the United States8. The rate of severe preeclampsia has increased over the past 3 decades. In the United States, 12% of maternal deaths are directly attributable to preeclampsia and eclampsia. However, morbidity is more common than mortality, and it is estimated that more than one third of severe obstetric complications are related to preeclampsia1.

	Preeclampsia accounts for 15% of preterm births in the United States and is a leading cause of medically indicated preterm birth. Delivery is the only cure for preeclampsia 1. Early-onset preeclampsia is usually more severe and often requires preterm delivery. Preterm infants (<37 weeks of gestation) are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality, and complications increase with earlier delivery. Additional important threats to the fetus from preeclampsia include IUGR, being small for gestational age, placental abruption, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and neonatal death. It is estimated that perinatal mortality is about 2 times higher in pregnancies affected by preeclampsia1.

	There are racial/ethnic disparities in the prevalence of and mortality from preeclampsia. Non-Hispanic black women are at greater risk for developing preeclampsia than other women and bear a greater burden of maternal and infant morbidity and perinatal mortality. In the United States, the rate of maternal death from preeclampsia is higher in non-Hispanic black women than in non-Hispanic white women. Disparities in risk factors for preeclampsia, limited access to early prenatal care, and obstetric interventions may account for some of the differences in prevalence and clinical outcomes1.

	Scope of Review

	In 1996, the USPSTF reviewed the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia9. The current review included new evidence on the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin in preventing preeclampsia in women at increased risk and in decreasing adverse maternal and perinatal health outcomes, as well as assessing the maternal and fetal harms of low-dose aspirin during pregnancy.

	Effectiveness of Preventive Medication

	The USPSTF considered 15 RCTs (8 good-quality) in women at increased risk for preeclampsia to evaluate maternal and perinatal health benefits and 13 RCTs (8 good-quality) to evaluate preeclampsia incidence. All trials were placebo-controlled1. One large trial was conducted in the United States, and another large, multinational trial was coordinated from the United Kingdom. Thirteen smaller trials were conducted in various developed countries. Preeclampsia incidence in women at increased risk ranged from 8% to 30% across studies.

	In general, trial participants were young (mean age range, 20.3 to 31 years) and white. Only 1 trial of women at increased risk for preeclampsia and 2 trials reporting harms included majority populations of black women. None of the trials initiated use of low-dose aspirin before 12 weeks of gestation, and 8 trials initiated prophylaxis before 16 weeks. The most common discontinuation date was upon delivery; however, 6 trials stopped aspirin use before delivery, as early as 35 weeks of gestation or when preeclampsia developed. Aspirin dosages ranged from 60 to 150 mg/d, with the majority of trials using 60 mg/d (6 RCTs) or 100 mg/d (8 RCTs)1. Included trials defined ""high risk"" differently because a validated method for identifying women who are at increased risk for preeclampsia is lacking.

	Two large RCTs, the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) trial and the Collaborative Low-dose Aspirin Study in Pregnancy (CLASP), provided the majority of the data for pooled estimates of benefit6, 7. The MFMU trial was conducted at 13 U.S. study sites in women at increased risk for preeclampsia (n = 2503). The treatment group received 60 mg/d of aspirin, but was instructed to stop taking the medication if preeclampsia developed. Women were at 13 to 26 weeks of gestation and belonged to 1 of the following predefined preeclampsia risk categories: pregestational diabetes mellitus (n = 471), chronic hypertension (n = 744), current multifetal gestation (n = 688), or preeclampsia in a prior pregnancy (n = 606)6.

	CLASP was a multinational trial (n = 9364) that included 16 sites (e.g., United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Germany, Spain, and Hong Kong). Women were enrolled to prevent or treat preeclampsia and IUGR on the basis of medical history. Risk factors for preeclampsia were prior IUGR or preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, renal disease, age, family history of preeclampsia, and multifetal gestation. Women were still eligible for study participation if their clinician was unsure whether or not they should receive low-dose aspirin. Two thirds of participants began taking aspirin before 20 weeks of gestation. Use of low-dose aspirin (60 mg/d) was continued until delivery7.

	Perinatal Outcomes

	The USPSTF found evidence of a 14% reduction in risk for preterm birth (pooled relative risk [RR], 0.86 [95% CI, 0.76 to 0.98]; 10 studies; I2 = 33.2%) among women at increased risk for preeclampsia who received low-dose aspirin (n = 11,779). This reduction in risk for preterm birth resulted from a decrease in the number of women with preeclampsia, as well as a delay in the development of preeclampsia. Pooled estimates provided evidence of a 20% reduction in risk for IUGR (RR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.65 to 0.99]; 13 studies; I2 = 36.0%) in women at increased risk for preeclampsia (n = 12,504). Low-dose aspirin increased the mean birthweight of infants (n = 10,712) by a pooled weighted mean difference of 130.0 g (95% CI, 36.2 to 223.3 g; I2 = 60%). There was no statistically significant reduction in perinatal mortality (pooled RR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.65 to 1.01]; 10 studies; I2 = 0%) in women at increased risk for preeclampsia (n = 12,240)1.

	Maternal Outcomes

	The USPSTF found evidence of a 24% reduction in risk for preeclampsia (pooled RR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.95]; 13 studies) with low-dose aspirin use in women at increased risk (n = 12,184). Heterogeneity was moderate across studies (I2 = 40.5%). Stratified comparisons did not show that the timing of aspirin initiation (<16 weeks) or dosage had an effect on preeclampsia prevention1.

	Maternal complications of preeclampsia (e.g., the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count [HELLP] syndrome, organ system failure, eclampsia, or death) rarely occurred in studies and could not be evaluated. Pooled analysis of the outcome of cesarean delivery (10 studies; n = 10,419) indicated no difference in the cesarean delivery rate among women receiving aspirin compared with those receiving placebo (RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.79 to 1.08]; I2 = 24.9%)1.

	The number needed to treat was calculated from the event rate in the trial data at the lowest level of risk for the outcome. The number needed to treat to prevent 1 diagnosis of preeclampsia was 42 (95% CI, 26 to 200); it was 71 (95% CI, 41 to 1429) for IUGR and 65 (95% CI, 38 to 455) for preterm birth. Absolute risk estimates based on observed event rates ranged from 2% to 5% for preeclampsia, 1% to 5% for IUGR, and 2% to 4% for preterm birth1. Sensitivity analyses using an alternate method for estimating pooled random effects resulted in similar point estimates and CIs and did not change the statistical significance of results for benefits or harms1.

	Results from the USPSTF's review are generally consistent with the findings from a Cochrane Collaboration systematic review10 and an individual patient–data meta-analysis (Perinatal Antiplatelet Review of International Studies [PARIS])11. The Cochrane review included 59 trials (37,560 women), and the PARIS meta-analysis included data from 31 trials (32,217 women and 32,819 infants). Although there were differences in study inclusion criteria, the USPSTF found similar effect estimates for preeclampsia, IUGR, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality, particularly compared with results from the PARIS meta-analysis.

	Dosage and Timing

	The USPSTF found no evidence from stratified comparisons that the timing of aspirin administration or the dosage had different effects. Comparison of dosage effects showed 1 outcome with a significant difference—preterm birth—when a cut-point of 75 mg/d was used. The reduction in risk for preterm birth was greater in studies using doses greater than 75 mg/d. However, the analyses were confounded by unequal distribution of sample sizes in different dosage categories because the largest studies (MFMU and CLASP) used 60 mg/d of aspirin. There was no evidence of a dose–response relationship1, 5.

	In 15 trials, use of low-dose aspirin was initiated between 12 and 28 weeks of gestation. None of the trials initiated use of aspirin before 12 weeks. In 8 trials, use of low-dose aspirin was initiated before 16 weeks. Evidence did not demonstrate benefit of starting aspirin earlier (12 to 16 weeks) rather than later (≥16 weeks) in pregnancy1.

	Potential Harms of Preventive Medication

	The USPSTF considered 19 RCTs (12 good-quality) and 2 good-quality observational studies to evaluate maternal, perinatal, and developmental harms. Studies of low- or average-risk pregnant women were included with trials of women at increased risk1.

	Low-dose aspirin use appeared to have no short-term harms during pregnancy. Eleven RCTs (23,332 women) reported on the outcome of placental abruption (6 trials in women with increased preeclampsia risk and 5 trials in women with low/average risk). Pooled analyses showed no statistically significant increase in abruption associated with aspirin (RR, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.93 to 1.48]; I2 = 36.4%).

	Eighteen trials reported on the outcome of perinatal mortality (with 4 smaller studies reporting no events). Pooled analyses (14 studies; n = 22,848) on perinatal mortality (RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.76 to 1.11]; I2 = 0%) suggested no harm from low-dose aspirin. When limited to women at increased risk for preeclampsia (n = 12,240), the estimate approached statistical significance for a benefit (RR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.65 to 1.01]; 10 studies; I2 = 0%)1.

	Nine trials (6 in women at increased preeclampsia risk and 3 in women at low risk; 22,760 women in total) reported on the outcome of postpartum hemorrhage. There was no evidence of a treatment effect (RR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.96 to 1.09]). Five trials (1 good-quality) in a total of 2748 women reported on the outcome of blood loss. No evidence demonstrated that low-dose aspirin affected blood loss. Studies found slightly lower mean blood loss or equivalent amounts of blood loss between study groups1.

	The pooled relative risk for intracranial hemorrhage in neonates (6 studies; n = 22,158) was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.61 to 1.16), with low heterogeneity (I2 = 27.1%; P = 0.23). Maternal death was a rare outcome and could not be evaluated1.

	The USPSTF found limited evidence on long-term outcomes in offspring from in utero exposure to low-dose aspirin. One observational study of birth defects resulting from aspirin exposure showed that the rate of cryptorchidism did not differ between male infants exposed and unexposed to aspirin in utero12. Another observational study on aspirin use during pregnancy had null findings for miscarriage13. Follow-up data from the largest trial, CLASP, reported no differences in physical or mental developmental outcomes (e.g., gross motor development, height, weight, or hospital visits) in infants at 18 months of age14.

	Seven trials reported adverse events; however, most were determined to be unrelated to treatment. Two studies reported women withdrawing from treatment because of itching of the throat and epigastric pain1.

	Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit

	The USPSTF found adequate evidence that daily low-dose aspirin use in women at high risk for preeclampsia is associated with improved health outcomes through the reduction of risk for preeclampsia, preterm birth, and IUGR. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that low-dose aspirin use does not increase the risk for placental abruption, postpartum hemorrhage, fetal intracranial bleeding, or perinatal mortality. The USPSTF did not identify any harmful effects of low-dose aspirin use on long-term outcomes in offspring; however, evidence was limited.

	Overall, the harms of low-dose aspirin use in pregnancy are considered to be no greater than small. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the magnitude of net benefit of low-dose aspirin use to prevent morbidity and mortality from preeclampsia in women at high risk is substantial.

	How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?

	Preeclampsia is a complex, multisystem inflammatory syndrome that can originate from multiple causes. It is thought to evolve from changes in placental development that result in placental ischemia. Poor placental perfusion may produce inflammation and oxidative stress. Preeclampsia may also develop as a result of overactive inflammatory responses to normal placentation. Preexisting inflammatory conditions are also thought to trigger systemic inflammatory and oxidative stress processes. The anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenesis, and antiplatelet properties of low-dose aspirin are believed to account for its preventive effect on preeclampsia.

	Response to Public Comments

	A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 8 April to 5 May 2014. Some comments requested clarification about risk factors for preeclampsia and the dosage and timing of initiation of low-dose aspirin. In response to these comments, the USPSTF added language about populations that are at risk for preeclampsia and aspirin dosages in the Clinical Considerations section. The USPSTF also added language to the Table to clarify the populations at risk. The USPSTF added language on the timing of initiation of low-dose aspirin in the Research Needs and Gaps section. Finally, the USPSTF provided more details about study characteristics and results in the Discussion section.",,Low-Dose Aspirin Use for the Prevention of Morbidity and Mortality From Preeclampsia,"Aspirin Use for Prevention of Morbidity and Mortality from Preeclampsia: Preventive Medication, 2014"
"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to all sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant women.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
Age is a strong predictor of risk for chlamydial and gonococcal infections, with the highest infection rates occurring in women aged 20 to 24 years, followed by females aged 15 to 19 years. Chlamydial infections are 10 times more prevalent than gonococcal infections in young adult women. Among men, infection rates are highest in those aged 20 to 24 years. <br /><br />Other risk factors for infection include having a new sex partner, more than 1 sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI; inconsistent condom use among persons who are not in mutually monogamous relationships; previous or coexisting STI; and exchanging sex for money or drugs. Prevalence is also higher among incarcerated populations, military recruits, and patients receiving care at public STI clinics. There are also racial and ethnic differences in STI prevalence. In 2012, black and Hispanic persons had higher rates of infection than white persons. Clinicians should consider the communities they serve and may want to consult local public health authorities for guidance on identifying groups that are at increased risk. Gonococcal infection, in particular, is concentrated in specific geographic locations and communities.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
<em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>&nbsp;infections should be diagnosed by using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) because their sensitivity and specificity are high and they are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use on urogenital sites, including male and female urine, as well as clinician-collected endocervical, vaginal, and male urethral specimens. Most NAATs that are approved for use on vaginal swabs are also approved for use on self-collected vaginal specimens in clinical settings. Rectal and pharyngeal swabs can be collected from persons who engage in receptive anal intercourse and oral sex, although these collection sites have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Urine testing with NAATs is at least as sensitive as testing with endocervical specimens, clinician- or self-collected vaginal specimens, or urethral specimens that are self-collected in clinical settings. The same specimen can be used to test for chlamydia and gonorrhea.
<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>
In the absence of studies on screening intervals, a reasonable approach would be to screen patients whose sexual history reveals new or persistent risk factors since the last negative test result.
<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>
Chlamydial and gonococcal infections respond to treatment with antibiotics. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and expedited partner therapy are available at &nbsp;<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/default.htm"" target=""_blank"">www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/default.htm</a>&nbsp; and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/std/ept/default.htm"" target=""_blank"">www.cdc.gov/std/ept/default.htm</a>, respectively. <br /><br />Posttest counseling is an integral part of management of patients with a newly diagnosed STI. The USPSTF recommends offering or referral to high-intensity behavioral counseling for patients with current or recent STIs (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsstds.htm"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsstds.htm</a>). Posttest counseling can also serve as an educational opportunity for patients who present with STI concerns but test negative for infection. It should address safe sex practices that can reduce disease transmission or reinfection; motivational interviewing strategies may also promote risk-reducing behaviors.<br /><br />To maximize adherence, the CDC recommends that drug treatment be dispensed on site. The CDC recommends that all sex partners of infected patients from the preceding 60 days be evaluated, tested, and treated for infection. It also recommends that infected patients be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until after they and their sex partners have completed treatment and no longer have symptoms. For a sex partner who cannot be linked to care, the CDC suggests that clinicians consider expedited partner therapy, which allows for the delivery of a drug or drug prescription to the partner by the patient, a disease investigation specialist, or a pharmacy. Because of a high likelihood of reinfection, the CDC also recommends retesting all patients diagnosed with chlamydial or gonococcal infection 3 months after treatment, regardless of whether they believe their partners have been treated.<br /><br />In pregnant women, a test of cure to document eradication of chlamydial infection 3 weeks after treatment is recommended. Pregnant women diagnosed with a chlamydial or gonococcal infection in the first trimester should be retested 3 months after treatment. Gonococcal neonatal ophthalmia, which can be transmitted from an untreated woman to her newborn, may be prevented with routine topical prophylaxis at delivery. However, prevention of chlamydial neonatal pneumonia and ophthalmia requires prenatal detection and treatment.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
Chlamydial and gonococcal infections are often asymptomatic in men but may result in urethritis, epididymitis, and proctitis. Uncommon complications include reactive arthritis (chlamydia) and disseminated gonococcal infection. Infections at extragenital sites (such as the pharynx and rectum) are typically asymptomatic. Chlamydial and gonococcal infections may facilitate HIV transmission in men and women. Median prevalence rates among men who have sex with men who were tested in STD Surveillance Network clinics in 2012 were 16% for gonorrhea and 12% for chlamydia.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
Potential harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea include false-positive or false-negative results as well as labeling and anxiety associated with positive results.
<h4>Costs</h4>
According to the CDC, STIs in the United States are associated with an annual cost of almost $16 billion. Among nonviral STIs, chlamydia is the most costly, with total associated costs of $516.7 million (range, $258.3 to $775.0 million). Gonococcal infections are associated with total costs of $162.1 million (range, $81.1 to $243.2 million). <br /><br />In 2008, estimated direct lifetime costs (in 2010 U.S. dollars) per case of chlamydial infection were $30 (range, $15 to $45) in men and $364 (range, $182 to $546) in women. Similarly, gonococcal infections were associated with direct costs of $79 (range, $40 to $119) in men and $354 (range, $182 to $546) in women.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
A review of health care claims of 4296 male and female patients presenting for general medical or gynecologic examinations from 2000 to 2003 found that a large proportion of those with high-risk sexual behaviors did not receive STI or HIV testing during their visit. According to a review of diagnostic billing codes for patients with high-risk sexual behaviors, men were significantly less likely than women to be tested for chlamydia (20.7% vs. 56.9%) and gonorrhea (20.7% vs. 50.9%), although they were more likely to be tested for HIV (79.3% vs. 38.8%) and syphilis (39.1% vs. 27.6%).
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
The USPSTF has issued recommendations on screening for other STIs, including hepatitis B, genital herpes, HIV, and syphilis. The USPSTF has also issued recommendations on behavioral counseling for all sexually active adolescents and for adults who are at increased risk for STIs. These recommendations are available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>.

<h3>Other Considerations</h3>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
Although the prevalence of chlamydia and gonorrhea differs, the risk factors for infection overlap and the USPSTF recommends screening for both simultaneously.
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Studies evaluating the effectiveness of different screening strategies for identifying persons who are at increased risk for infection, cotesting for concurrent STIs, and different screening intervals are needed to inform practice guidelines. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of screening asymptomatic men to reduce the consequences of infection and transmission to sexual partners are needed. Identification of subgroups for whom screening may be effective is a high priority. Possible subgroups include men who have sex with men, sexually active males younger than 24 years, and men residing in high-prevalence communities. Currently, no studies provide data about the potential adverse effects of screening in any population.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chlamydia-and-gonorrhea-screening#Pod5,149,"The CDC recommends annual screening for chlamydia in all sexually active females aged 25 years or younger and in older women with specific risk factors (for example, those who have new or multiple sex partners and those reporting that their sex partner may have a concurrent sex partner), as well as screening for gonorrhea in sexually active females who are at increased risk for infection (such as those aged &lt;25 years). The CDC does not recommend routine screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in the general population. It recommends that clinicians consider screening for chlamydia in sexually active young men in high-prevalence settings. The CDC recommends annual screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men who have sex with men, based on exposure history, with more frequent screening in populations at highest risk. <br /><br />The CDC recommends screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea upon intake in juvenile detention or jail facilities in females aged 35 years or younger. It also recommends screening for gonorrhea in high-risk pregnant women and for chlamydia in all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit. The CDC recommends retesting in the third trimester in pregnant women with continued risk for infection and in those who test positive at their first prenatal visit. <br /><br />Because of the high likelihood of reinfection, the CDC also recommends retesting all patients diagnosed with chlamydial or gonococcal infections 3 months after treatment, regardless of whether they believe their partners have been treated. <br /><br />The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in sexually active females aged 25 years or younger. It also recommends screening for chlamydia in women older than 25 years who have risk factors (such as new or multiple sex partners) and for gonorrhea in asymptomatic women who are at high risk for infection (such as those with a previous gonococcal infection, other STIs, or new or multiple sex partners, as well as inconsistent condom use, commercial sex work, or illicit drug use). <br /><br />The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends routine annual screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in all sexually active females aged 25 years or younger. It recommends routine annual screening for rectal and urethral chlamydia in sexually active adolescent and young adult males who have sex with males if they engage in receptive anal or insertive intercourse, respectively, and routine annual screening for pharyngeal, rectal, and urethral gonorrhea if they engage in receptive oral, anal, or insertive intercourse, respectively. It recommends screening every 3 to 6 months for persons in this population if they are at high risk (for example, if they have multiple or anonymous partners, sex in conjunction with illicit drug use, or sex partners who participate in these activities). It also recommends screening adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to chlamydia or gonorrhea in the past 60 days from an infected partner. Clinicians should consider annual screening for chlamydia in sexually active males in settings with high prevalence rates, such as jail or juvenile correction facilities, national job training programs, STD clinics, high school clinics, and adolescent clinics (for patients who have a history of multiple partners). Clinicians should consider annual screening for gonorrhea in other sexually active and young adult males on the basis of individual and population-based risk factors. <br /><br />The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in sexually active females aged 24 years or younger and in older women who are at increased risk for infection. It concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men. <br /><br />Canadian guidelines recommend screening for chlamydia in all sexually active males and females younger than 25 years and retesting at 6 months after treatment in infected patients. They also recommend screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea at the first prenatal visit and again during the third trimester in pregnant women who test positive or are at increased risk for infection.","Burden of Disease

	Chlamydia and gonorrhea are the most commonly reported STIs in the United States1. In 2012, more than 1.4 million cases of chlamydial infection were reported to the CDC1. However, its true incidence is difficult to accurately estimate because most infections are asymptomatic and are therefore undetected. Chlamydial infections are 10 times more prevalent than gonococcal infections (4.7% vs. 0.4%) in women aged 18 to 26 years2. In 2012, the rate of chlamydial infection in females (643.3 cases per 100,000) was more than double the rate in males (262.6 cases per 100,000), with the majority of cases occurring in females aged 15 to 24 years1.

	In 2012, more than 330,000 cases of gonococcal infection were reported to the CDC1. The majority of infections occurred in females aged 15 to 24 years and men aged 20 to 24 years. The infection rate was similar for females and males (108.7 vs. 105.8 cases per 100,000, respectively)1.

	Scope of Review

	The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review7, 11 of studies published since it previously reviewed these topics12–14. The USPSTF also considered evidence from its previous recommendations and reviews. Included studies had to be applicable to clinical settings and practices in the United States, as determined by the similarity of participants, health care services, and available screening tests. Conditions of interest included chlamydial and gonococcal infections in asymptomatic patients. The key questions are described in the systematic review7, 11.

	Accuracy of Screening Tests

	The USPSTF found convincing evidence that available screening tests can accurately diagnose chlamydial and gonococcal infections. Ten fair-quality studies on diagnostic accuracy15–24 indicate that screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea with NAATs is highly accurate for specimens from various anatomical sites for women and men 7.

	Sensitivity of NAAT specimens collected from genitourinary sites for detecting chlamydia ranged from 86% to 100% in studies without major limitations. In women, sensitivity of NAAT specimens varied slightly across endocervical specimens, clinician- or self-collected vaginal specimens, and urine specimens that were self-collected in clinical settings. In men, testing of urine specimens was slightly more sensitive than testing of urethral specimens. Sensitivity of NAATs for gonorrhea ranged from 90% to 100% in studies without major limitations. Specificity was high across all specimens and tests for both chlamydia and gonorrhea7.

	Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment

	Previous USPSTF reviews identified 2 randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) of the effectiveness of screening for chlamydia for the prevention of PID in nonpregnant women at increased risk for infection. In 1 large RCT, a strategy of identifying, testing, and treating women at increased risk for cervical chlamydial infection was associated with significantly reduced incidence of PID (relative risk [RR], 0.44 [95% CI, 0.20 to 0.90])25. Study limitations included a follow-up period of only 1 year, possible selection and ascertainment biases, and a relatively low participation rate. In another RCT, which was conducted in 1761 female high school students in Denmark, universal, 1-time, home-based screening was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of chlamydial infection (RR, 0.45 [CI, 0.24 to 0.84]) and a reduction in the incidence of PID that did not achieve statistical significance (RR, 0.50 [CI, 0.23 to 1.08]) compared with opportunistic physician-based screening after 1 year of follow-up26. This study was rated as poor-quality because of significant loss to follow-up.

	The current USPSTF review identified 1 good-quality RCT of 2529 sexually active young women recruited from universities and colleges in the United Kingdom27. Among asymptomatic women, 0.6% in the screening group versus 1.6% in the deferred group developed PID during follow-up (RR, 0.39 [CI, 0.14 to 1.08])7, 11. Study limitations included inadequate recruitment, testing for chlamydia outside the study protocol in nearly one quarter of participants, and difficulty in PID ascertainment. These limitations may have attenuated intervention effects, and the study may have been underpowered.

	The USPSTF previously found fair-quality evidence that treatment of chlamydial infection during pregnancy is associated with improved outcomes for infants and mothers28. The USPSTF reviewed large cohort studies of screening at the first prenatal visit in pregnant women at increased risk for infection29, 30. These studies found that treatment of chlamydial infection was associated with significantly lower rates of preterm delivery, early rupture of membranes, and infants with low birthweight compared with no treatment or treatment failure. No subsequent studies met inclusion criteria for the current USPSTF review7, 11.

	The USPSTF found little direct evidence on the effectiveness of screening for chlamydia in men or low-risk women. It found that the overall prevalence of chlamydial infection in the general population varies widely depending on age and other risk factors31. Chlamydial infection may cause epididymitis in men, but serious complications are not common. Screening and treating young men at increased risk may reduce the incidence of chlamydial infection; however, the USPSTF found no published prospective trials of the effect of routine screening in men or comparison with the strategy of screening women and treating their male partners7, 11, 28, 32. The USPSTF found no studies on the benefits of screening women, including pregnant women, who are not at increased risk for infection. Decisions about screening women who are not at high risk on the basis of individual factors may depend on local disease burden.

	The USPSTF found no studies of the effectiveness of screening for gonorrhea in its current or previous reviews7. It previously found indirect evidence of the benefits of early detection and treatment, including the substantial prevalence of asymptomatic infection, the availability of accurate screening tests and effective treatments, and the high morbidity associated with untreated infection in women29. Gonococcal infections in women are frequently asymptomatic33. Asymptomatic men and women represent an important reservoir of new infection. In women, 10% to 20% of untreated infections lead to PID34, which may lead to hospitalization, surgery, chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility.

	Although untested in controlled trials, early detection and treatment of gonorrhea in pregnant women at increased risk for infection may decrease morbidity from infection-related obstetric complications. The primary rationale for screening all pregnant women is prevention of ophthalmia neonatorum. However, the USPSTF recognizes the low prevalence of infection in pregnant women who are not at increased risk and the effectiveness of universal ocular prophylaxis in newborns. Accordingly, the USPSTF concluded that the net benefit of screening for gonorrhea in pregnant women who are not at increased risk for infection is small.

	The USPSTF found little direct evidence on the effectiveness of screening for gonorrhea in men or low-risk women7, 11, 29, 35. It previously found that screening for gonorrhea in all sexually active adults is inefficient because of its low prevalence in these groups29, 35. Moreover, the majority of genital gonococcal infections in men are symptomatic, which can result in more timely clinical presentation and lead to diagnosis and treatment that prevents serious complications36.

	The USPSTF found no studies comparing the effectiveness of different screening strategies for chlamydia and gonorrhea in asymptomatic persons or the effectiveness of sampling from various anatomical sites, cotesting for concurrent STIs, or using different screening intervals 7.

	Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment

	Ten fair-quality studies on diagnostic accuracy (described previously)15–24 indicated that screening tests for chlamydia and gonorrhea had low rates of false-positive and false-negative results across all NAATs and specimen types. False-positive test results may occur more frequently among low-prevalence populations.

	The current USPSTF review7 identified several published studies that describe some of the psychosocial harms of testing (such as anxiety and strain on relationships). However, these studies did not meet inclusion criteria because they included symptomatic persons and focused on reactions to positive test results rather than screening. No studies addressing other harms (for example, labeling or screening-related anxiety) met inclusion criteria.

	Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit

	The USPSTF found direct evidence that screening for chlamydia in women who are at increased risk for infection is associated with moderate benefit, including reduced incidence of PID in nonpregnant women and improved infant and maternal outcomes in pregnant women. The USPSTF noted the existence of shared risk factors for gonococcal and chlamydial infections as well as the availability of effective methods for their detection and treatment. On the basis of these factors, the USPSTF found indirect evidence of moderate benefit of screening for gonorrhea in women who are at increased risk for infection. The USPSTF found that screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea is associated with harms that are small to none. Therefore, it concludes with moderate certainty that screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea has a moderate net benefit in this population.

	The USPSTF found inadequate evidence of the benefit of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men, although the harms from screening are small to none. It concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men.

	How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?

	Chlamydial and gonococcal infections are often asymptomatic in women. Untreated infections may progress to PID-related complications, such as chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, or infertility. Infections may also be transmitted to sex partners and newborn children. Accurate screening tests and effective antibiotic treatments are available for chlamydia and gonorrhea.

	In men, chlamydial and gonococcal infections are more likely to cause symptoms that lead to diagnosis and treatment, and serious complications are less common; also, gonorrhea is more likely than chlamydia to cause symptoms. In the absence of empirical evidence that screening in men reduces disease transmission to women, the USPSTF concludes that the benefits of screening in men are unknown.

	Response to Public Comments

	A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 29 April to 26 May 2014. The USPSTF considered all comments received during this period. In response to comments, the USPSTF separated its recommendations on screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea, in recognition of differences in the diseases and the respective evidence. It clarified that the studies it reviewed on the direct effects of screening for chlamydia, including 1 new good-quality RCT, showed mixed results. This led to the change in grade for screening for chlamydia, which is now based on “moderate” certainty of a moderate net benefit rather than “high certainty” of a substantial net benefit. The USPSTF also clarified some of the differences between chlamydial and gonococcal infections in men and women. The revised recommendation statement also includes clarifications on risk assessment, screening tests, screening intervals, and treatments.","<div>
<h3>Importance</h3>
Chlamydia and gonorrhea are the most commonly reported sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the United States. In 2012, more than 1.4 million cases of chlamydia and more than 330,000 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Chlamydial infections are 10 times more prevalent than gonococcal infections (4.7% vs. 0.4%) in women aged 18 to 26 years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Although most identified cases are reported, the incidence of chlamydia and gonorrhea is difficult to estimate because most infections are asymptomatic and are therefore never diagnosed. The CDC estimates that more than 800,000 persons are infected with gonorrhea in the United States each year, and fewer than half of these infections are diagnosed and reported.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Chlamydial and gonococcal infections are often asymptomatic in women; however, asymptomatic infection may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and its associated complications, such as ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and chronic pelvic pain. Newborns of women with untreated infection may develop neonatal chlamydial pneumonia or gonococcal or chlamydial ophthalmia. Infection may lead to symptomatic urethritis and epididymitis in men, although gonorrhea is more likely than chlamydia to be symptomatic in men compared with women. Both types of infection may facilitate HIV transmission

"<h3>Patient Population</h3>
This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults aged 50 years or older. It does not apply to persons seeking evaluation for perceived hearing problems or for cognitive or affective symptoms that may be related to hearing loss. These persons should be assessed for objective hearing impairment and treated when indicated.
<h3>Risk Assessment</h3>
Aging is the most important risk factor for hearing loss. Presbycusis, a gradual, progressive decline in the ability to perceive high-frequency tones due to degeneration of hair cells in the ear, is the most common cause of hearing loss in older adults. However, hearing loss may result from several contributing factors. Other risk factors include a history of exposure to loud noises or ototoxic agents, including occupational exposures; previous recurring inner ear infections; genetic factors; and certain systemic diseases, such as diabetes.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Available screening tests include physical diagnostic tests, such as the whispered voice, finger rub, and watch tick tests (bearing in mind that many modern watches no longer audibly tick); single-question screening or longer patient questionnaires; and handheld audiometers. All are relatively accurate and reliable screening tools for identifying adults with objective hearing loss. In addition, self-administered questionnaires, such as HHIE-S, can identify adults with perceived (or subjective) hearing difficulty. Not all adults with perceived hearing difficulty have objective hearing loss.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
Before a person receives a hearing aid, diagnosis of objective hearing loss should be confirmed with a pure-tone audiogram. Fair evidence from studies in highly selected populations shows that hearing aids can improve self-reported hearing, communication, and social functioning for some adults with age-related hearing loss.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding I Statement</h3>
<em>Potential preventable burden.</em> Finding objective hearing loss indicates eligibility for a hearing aid but does not convincingly identify persons who will find the devices helpful and wearable and will use them. One subgroup analysis of a randomized, controlled trial found that in older adults who did not have self-perceived hearing loss at study entry, screening and receipt of a free hearing aid did not increase use after 1 year compared with an unscreened control group (and overall use was low, at 0% to 1.6%). However, health-related quality of life is improved for some adults with moderate to severe hearing loss who use hearing aids compared with those who do not. <em>Cost.</em>The cost of screening varies according to the test. The cost of a questionnaire consists of the time required of both the patient and clinician. In-office clinical techniques (whispered voice, finger rub, or watch tick tests) and audiometry are quick to perform; however, handheld audiometers have up-front equipment costs. Diagnostic confirmation of a positive screen is typically done with a pure-tone audiogram, which requires a soundproof booth and trained personnel to administer the test and takes approximately 1 hour to complete. The cost of a hearing aid is a barrier to use for many older adults because it is not covered by Medicare and many private insurance companies.
<h3>Other Considerations</h3>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Future studies should concentrate on patients older than 70 years and examine whether there are differential effects of treatment on outcomes at different ages (for example, older than 70 or 80 years). Adequately powered studies are needed to better evaluate the effect of screening for hearing loss on health outcomes, such as emotional and social functioning, communication ability, and cognitive function, rather than intermediate measures, such as hearing aid use or satisfaction, particularly among adults without self-perceived or established hearing loss at baseline. The incremental benefits and costs of screening asymptomatic adults compared with only testing and treating those who seek treatment of perceived hearing impairment are unknown. Knowledge of specific factors or patient characteristics associated with increased and sustained use of hearing aids, once prescribed, could permit testing and treatment targeted to those most likely to benefit.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf11/adulthearing/adulthearrs.htm#clinical,120,The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association recommends that adults be screened once per decade and every 3 years after age 50 years. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that female patients aged 13 years or older be evaluated and counseled on hearing as part of the periodic health assessment. The American Academy of Family Physicians is in the process of updating its recommendation.,"Burden of Disease
The normal human ear can process sound frequencies from 20 to 20,000 Hz, with 500 to 4000 Hz being the most important range for speech processing. There is no universally accepted definition for hearing loss because frequency and intensity thresholds vary depending on the reference criteria used. However, commonly used definitions for mild and moderate hearing loss are the inability to hear frequencies associated with speech processing at less than 25 or 40 dB of volume, respectively 3, 4.
The prevalence of hearing loss varies depending on the definition used, but 
      population-based estimates range from 20% to 40% in adults older than 50 years to more 
      than 80% in adults aged 80 years or older 3, 4. 
      Onset of sensorineural hearing loss is subtle, and individuals may therefore not recognize 
      or report symptoms to their health care providers; comorbid medical conditions, such as 
      cognitive impairment, may also interfere with acknowledgment of hearing deficits 
      5. Underreporting of symptoms may also occur if the person fears 
      social stigma as a result of diagnosis. As such, the prevalence of this condition may 
      be underestimated.
Hearing loss can negatively affect a person’s quality of life and ability to function 
      independently 6. Persons with hearing loss may have difficulty 
      with speech discrimination and localization of sounds 7. Hearing 
      impairment has been shown to be associated with increased social isolation and emotional 
      dysfunction among older adults 8, 9. 
Scope of Review
The USPSTF reviewed randomized, controlled trials and controlled observational studies 
      published between 1950 and January 2010 on screening for age-related sensorineural hearing 
      impairment in adults aged 50 years or older without diagnosed hearing loss in the primary 
      care setting. It examined evidence on the following topics: association of screening with 
      improved health outcomes, accuracy of screening methods, incremental benefit of early 
      (rather than symptomatic) detection, effectiveness of treatment, and harms of screening and 
      treatment. Congenital hearing loss, conductive hearing loss, and hearing loss due to 
      occupational exposure or acute trauma were not included in this review.
Accuracy of Screening Tests
Several screening examinations for hearing loss can be used in primary care settings, 
      including clinical testing methods (whispered voice, finger rub, and watch tick tests), 
      single-question screening (asking, “Do you have difficulty with your hearing?”) or 
      multiple-item patient questionnaires (HHIE-S), and handheld audiometers. Twenty studies, 
      including 7 of good quality and 13 of fair quality, evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of 
      various screening methods compared with a pure-tone audiogram for detection of hearing 
      impairment in older adults. Six good-quality studies directly compared the accuracy of 
      screening methods for hearing impairment in older adults 3, 4.
Studies used different thresholds and criteria to define hearing impairment, which makes 
      comparison of methods somewhat challenging, but evidence is consistent that common 
      screening tests are useful in identifying persons at increased risk for hearing loss. 
      Simple screening methods, such as the whispered voice test and single-question screening, 
      seem to be nearly as accurate for detecting hearing loss as more detailed questionnaires 
      or handheld audiometers 3, 4. Negative findings 
      on handheld audiometers may be particularly helpful in ruling out hearing loss greater 
      than 40 dB.
Median positive likelihood ratios (LRs) among the screening tests at greater than 25 or 
      30 dB were in the range of 3.0 to 5.1 for single-question screening, HHIE-S, and whispered 
      voice test at 2 feet (in ascending order). Negative LRs ranged from 0.03 to 0.52 for 
      whispered voice test, single-question screening, and HHIE-S. The median positive LR at 
      greater than 40 dB for the AudioScope audiometer (Welch Allyn, Skaneateles Falls, New York) 
      was 5.8 (range, 1.7 to 4.9), and the median negative LR was 0.05 (range, 0.03 to 0.08) 
      3, 4. Finger rub and watch tick tests had 
      substantially stronger positive LRs (10 and 70, respectively) compared with other screening 
      methods, but they were only evaluated in a single study 10 and 
      the CIs were very wide (2.6 to 43 and 4.4 to 1120, respectively). Negative LRs for 
      the finger rub and watch tick tests were 0.75 (95% CI, 0.68 to 0.84) and 0.57 (CI, 0.46 
      to 0.66), respectively.
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment
Direct evidence of the effect of screening for hearing loss on clinical outcomes is 
      limited. Only 1 fair-quality randomized, controlled trial examined the effect of screening 
      on hearing aid use. The SAI-WHAT (Screening for Auditory Impairment–Which Hearing 
      Assessment Test) trial 1 randomly assigned 2305 predominately 
      male veterans aged 50 years or older to hearing-loss screening with a tone-emitting 
      otoscope (AudioScope), the HHIE-S questionnaire, or combined testing versus a 
      control group of no screening. The primary outcome was hearing aid use 1 year 
      after screening. The mean age of participants was 61 years, and three fourths 
      reported self-perceived hearing loss at baseline. A total of 18.6% of participants 
      in the AudioScope group, 59.2% in the HHIE-S group, and 63.6% in the combined 
      method group had positive screening tests. Persons in any screening group were 
      more likely to wear hearing aids 1 year after screening than were control participants: 
      hearing aid use was 6.3% in the AudioScope group, 4.1% in the HHIE-S group, and 7.4% in the 
      combined group versus 3.3% in control participants (P = 0.003 for test of equality across 
      all 4 groups). Post hoc analysis showed that hearing aid use was more common among 
      participants reporting self-perceived hearing loss, but regardless of screening status 
      hearing aid use was very low among those without perceived hearing impairment at baseline 
      (0% to 1.6%). A secondary outcome of the trial was the effect of hearing aid use on quality 
      of life, as measured by the Inner Effectiveness of Aural Rehabilitation scale. No 
      statistically significant differences in scores were seen across the study groups after 1 
      year; however, the trial was powered to detect differences in hearing aid use rather than 
      hearing-related function, so this finding does not definitively rule out a potential 
      beneficial effect. The generalizability of these results is limited because the study 
      comprised relatively younger male veterans with a high prevalence of perceived hearing loss 
      who were eligible for free treatment services.
A good-quality trial 2 randomly assigned 194 male veterans (mean 
      age, 72 years) with screen-detected (two thirds of participants) or previously established 
      (one third of participants) hearing loss to immediate receipt of a free hearing aid or a 
      wait-list control group. Screening was done with the AudioScope when it was part of the 
      eligibility assessment, and a positive result was defined as hearing impairment of greater 
      than 40 dB in the better ear, with confirmation by a pure-tone audiogram. The outcome of 
      interest was quality-of-life improvements, including social, affective, cognitive, and 
      physical domains, at 4 months as measured by a battery of self-administered instruments, 
      including the HHIE, Quantified Denver Scale of Communicative Function (QDS), Short Portable 
      Mental Status Questionnaire, Geriatric Depression Scale, and Self-Evaluation of Life 
      Function. At study entry, 63% of participants reported having severe effects on 
      hearing-related social and emotional quality of life and functioning (as defined by an HHIE 
      score of ≥42); the mean HHIE score for all participants was 50. Moderate communication 
      difficulty was reported by 85% of participants (as defined by a QDS score of >30). At 
      the 4-month follow-up, HHIE and QDS scores were unchanged in the control group, but in the 
      group that received hearing aids mean HHIE scores improved from 49 to 15 and mean QDS 
      scores improved from 59 to 36. Mean between-group differences in HHIE and QDS scores at 4 
      months were 34 and 24, respectively. A follow-up study found that improvements in HHIE and 
      QDS scores in the intervention group persisted at 12 months 11. 
      Changes in Geriatric Depression Scale and Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire scores 
      differed significantly between the hearing aid and control groups, but the absolute effects 
      were very small (<1-point difference), and baseline scores did not indicate substantial 
      levels of depression or cognitive dysfunction in this population. The trial’s source 
      population of white male veterans, high prevalence of moderate to severe hearing loss at 
      study entry, and inclusion of a relatively large proportion of participants with 
      established (rather than screen-detected) hearing impairment restricts the generalizability 
      of these findings.
The USPSTF also reviewed 2 fair-quality trials and 1 poor-quality trial of treatment of 
      hearing loss with hearing aids. One trial found no clear difference between an assistive 
      listening device and no treatment on changes in mean baseline scores on the HHIE-S, 
      Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit, or Revised QDS in veterans who were ineligible 
      for free hearing aids 12. Another trial found no difference between 
      a hearing aid, assistive listening device, or both and no amplification in mean scores on 
      the HHIE-S, Brief Symptom Inventory, Activity Scale, Life Satisfaction in the Elderly 
      Scale, or Affect Balance Scale in a subset of patients who had mild baseline hearing loss 
      and were not using hearing aids at enrollment 13. The third trial 
      did not report outcomes with sufficient detail for reliable interpretation 
      14. 
Potential Harms of Early Detection and Treatment 
No  randomized trials or controlled observational studies evaluated potential adverse 
      effects associated with screening or treating hearing impairment using  hearing aids. In 
      community-based and primary care settings, rates of  false-positive tests (using >25 
      dB as a threshold for a positive screen)  ranged from 5% to 41% 3, 4, depending on the test and the population.  Screening could also 
      potentially be associated with anxiety, labeling and  stigma, or other psychosocial 
      effects, but no studies were available to  estimate these outcomes. According to case 
      reports, treatment with hearing aids  may be associated with cerumen impaction, 
      dermatitis, accidental retention of  molds, otitis externa, and associated middle 
      ear problems 3, 4. Because  screening and 
      confirmatory testing for hearing impairment are noninvasive and  serious harms of 
      treatment are rare, there are probably little to no adverse  effects of screening for 
      hearing loss.
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit 
A fair-quality randomized trial that directly evaluated the effect of screening for 
      hearing impairment showed a statistically significant increase in the use of hearing aids 
      among screened groups after 1 year; however, no conclusions could be drawn about the 
      effect of screening on health outcomes, such as improved quality of life and ability to 
      function. One good-quality randomized trial of treatment showed that hearing aids can 
      improve communication ability and social function for some older adults with known hearing 
      impairment. In both trials, however, the study population was essentially limited to white 
      male veterans with self-perceived or established moderate to severe hearing loss; as such, 
      the applicability of the findings to a broader asymptomatic population is unclear. 
      Furthermore, adherence to hearing aid use among participants diagnosed with hearing 
      impairment in the SAI-WHAT trial was low, particularly among those who did not report 
      self-perceived hearing loss at baseline. Although studies have consistently demonstrated 
      that various screening tests (including clinical examinations, single- or multiple-item 
      questionnaires, and handheld audiometers) can successfully identify persons with objective 
      hearing loss, it is less clear how to recognize persons who will adhere to—and thus 
      benefit from—treatment. The incremental value of screening and diagnosing 
      asymptomatic older adults with hearing impairment in advance of presentation with 
      symptoms is therefore unclear.
Given unknown efficacy in a general, asymptomatic population, the USPSTF concludes that 
      the evidence is insufficient to determine the net benefit of screening for hearing loss in 
      older adults.
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding? 
Although  sensorineural hearing loss is a relatively common consequence of aging, onset  
      of presbycusis is gradual, so many older adults may not recognize that they  have an 
      impairment or may not perceive their sensory deficits to be a problem.  Some persons may 
      simply alter their daily activities to adapt to the loss. In addition,  some older adults 
      may resist seeking treatment of hearing impairment or  adhering to use of a hearing aid 
      because of fear of social stigma or loss of  independence. Limited evidence suggests that, 
      when used, hearing aids can improve  quality of life and ability to function in selected 
      populations with moderate  to severe hearing loss; sustained hearing aid use seems to be 
      most closely associated  with self-perceived hearing impairment or a greater magnitude of 
      hearing loss.  Without additional study, the relative value and likelihood of success of  
      detecting and treating hearing loss in persons who are not aware of a problem  before 
      screening or have not sought care for perceived hearing loss are  unclear.
Response to Public Comments 
A draft version of this  recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the 
      USPSTF Web site  from 4 October to 11 November 2011 and again from 30 November to 13 
      December  2011. In response to the comments, the USPSTF has clarified its interest in 
      health and functional outcomes related to screening and treatment of hearing loss and added 
      language to emphasize that some persons with moderate to severe hearing  loss have shown
      improvements in quality of life with hearing aid use. It also  clarified the patient 
      population to which the recommendation applies.
Several commenters asked  the USPSTF to consider data about the effect of hearing loss on social  functioning of affected persons, their partners and families, and employment  issues. Commenters were concerned about hearing loss being potentially  misinterpreted by clinicians or caregivers as cognitive impairment. The USPSTF  was also asked to consider potential benefits of incidental detection of other  health conditions (for example, acoustic neuromas or multiple sclerosis) or  prevention of ongoing hearing deterioration. Although the USPSTF agrees that  these are important issues surrounding hearing loss, available evidence does  not permit conclusions to be drawn about the actual effect of screening on any of  these factors. Beneficial effects of hearing conservation measures should be  detectable through the broader evaluation of hearing outcomes over time.
Several commenters asked  the USPSTF to consider whether an alternative recommendation should be offered for  higher-risk groups. The USPSTF has specified populations that are at higher  risk for hearing loss in the recommendation statement; however, the net benefit  of screening in these groups and whether it differs from the general population  are unknown.
 Finally, commenters asked  for direction from the USPSTF on standardizing screening approaches in clinical  practice. Given the underlying uncertainty about the net benefit of screening,  it is presently difficult to provide evidence-based guidance on optimum screening  approaches. Currently, no single standard of care seems to exist. Therefore, additional  research is needed to clarify the ultimate effect of screening and treatment of  hearing loss and to better define best practices to maximize potential for  benefit.",,Hearing Loss in Older Adults,"Hearing Loss in Older Adults, Screening, August 2012"
"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
These recommendations apply to asymptomatic women of reproductive age and elderly and vulnerable adults. Reproductive age is defined across studies as ranging from 14 to 46 years, with most research focusing on women age 18 years or older. The term &ldquo;intimate partner violence&rdquo; describes physical, sexual, or psychological harm by a current or former partner or spouse. This type of violence can occur among heterosexual or same-sex couples and does not require sexual intimacy. A vulnerable adult is a person age 18 years or older whose ability to perform the normal activities of daily living or to provide for his or her own care or protection is impaired because of a mental, emotional, long-term physical, or developmental disability or dysfunction or brain damage. Definitions vary by state, and sometimes include the receipt of personal care services from others. Types of abuse that apply to elderly and vulnerable adults include physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional or psychological abuse, neglect, abandonment, financial or material exploitation, and self-neglect.Child abuse and neglect is addressed in a separate recommendation.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
Although all women are at potential risk for abuse, factors that elevate risk include young age, substance abuse, marital difficulties, and economic hardships.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Several screening instruments can be used to screen women for IPV. Those with the highest levels of sensitivity and specificity for identifying IPV are Hurt, Insult, Threaten, Scream (HITS) (English and Spanish versions); Ongoing Abuse Screen/Ongoing Violence Assessment Tool (OAS/OVAT); Slapped, Threatened, and Throw (STaT); Humiliation, Afraid, Rape, Kick (HARK); Modified Childhood Trauma Questionnaire&ndash;Short Form (CTQ-SF); and Woman Abuse Screen Tool (WAST).The HITS instrument includes 4 questions, can be used in a primary care setting, and is available in both English and Spanish. It can be self- or clinician-administered. HARK is a self-administered 4-item instrument. STaT is a 3-item self-report instrument that was tested in an emergency department setting.The USPSTF found no valid, reliable screening tools to identify abuse of elderly or vulnerable adults in the primary care setting.
<h3>Screening Interval</h3>
The USPSTF found no evidence on appropriate intervals for screening.
<h3>Interventions</h3>
Evidence from randomized trials support a variety of interventions for women of childbearing age, including counseling, home visits, information cards, referrals to community services, and mentoring support. Depending on the type of intervention, these services may be provided by clinicians, nurses, social workers, nonclinician mentors, or community workers. Counseling generally includes information on safety behaviors and community resources. In addition to counseling, home visits may include emotional support, education on problem-solving strategies, and parenting support. One study used a 20-minute nurse case management protocol focusing on a safety plan, supportive care, and guided referrals. No intervention studies were identified for elderly or vulnerable adults. See the following discussion for suggestions for practice in this population.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement for Elderly or Vulnerable Adults</h3>
<em>Potential benefits.</em> The estimated prevalence of elder abuse ranges from 2% to 10% based on a variety of different definitions, methods, and sampling strategies. One study indicated that 1 in 10 elderly adults may experience abuse, but only 1 in 5 or fewer cases are actually reported.  <em>Potential harms.</em> Although there is no direct evidence, the existing evidence about the lack of harms resulting from IPV screening suggests that the harms of screening elderly and vulnerable adults might also be small. Some potential harms of screening include shame, guilt, self-blame, fear of retaliation or abandonment by perpetrators, and the repercussions of false-positive results.  <em>Costs.</em> There is no evidence about the costs of screening for or interventions to reduce elder abuse. <em>Current practice.</em>Screening practices for elder abuse are limited for many reasons. Currently, there are no standards about how clinicians should ask elderly patients about possible abuse. In addition, there are varying definitions of abuse, a wide variety of mechanisms of elder abuse, no universal screening tools, wide-ranging risk factors, unclear guidance about whom to screen and what to do if abuse is identified, physician discomfort with screening, and time constraints. Screening is not done routinely and varies by locality. However, all providers should be aware of the laws in their states for reporting suspected abuse. Not all states mandate reporting, and some provide clear guidance about what type of injuries should arouse suspicion.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The USPSTF has several recommendations that may be relevant, including screening for depression&nbsp;and alcohol misuse (update in progress). Other useful resources include Web sites that contain materials useful to primary care providers. Providers often need guidance on how to address concerns about IPV with sensitivity and clarity and how to screen for IPV and provide follow-up care. Intimate partner violence introduces significant safety issues that compel a provider to be fully informed on such aspects as sensitivity. Providers also need easy access to available tools, specific guidelines, and other related materials to help them develop a clinical environment dedicated to the safety of their patients. Guidance is also available on how providers can work with local community-based domestic violence programs to receive training, information, and other resources to ensure effective management of patients who are victims of IPV. Providers should also be aware of their state and local reporting requirements. The laws vary from one jurisdiction to another, with differences in definitions, whom and what should be reported, who should report, and to whom. Although reporting suspected elder and child abuse is mandated in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, this is not the case with IPV. In addition, providers also need to be familiar with requirements in the privacy regulations of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which require that patients be advised on health information use and disclosure practices. Again, state laws around privacy issues or concerns vary. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has resources available for those needing additional information at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/intimatepartnerviolence/resources.html"">http://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/intimatepartnerviolence/resources.html</a>.
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Evidence on the use of newer screening approaches would be useful. Computerized screening and intervention increase rates of domestic violence discussion, disclosure, and service provision. Furthermore, computerized screening has been found to be more acceptable for patients. Patients perceive use of an audio questionnaire as more private and less likely to increase risk for abuse. Further evaluation of the accuracy, efficiency, and acceptability of these methods is needed.  Studies of the diagnostic accuracy of screening instruments are limited by the lack of accepted reference standards. Further development or validation of an accepted standard would allow more accurate assessment of performance measures and allow instruments to be more readily compared with each other. The broad and inconsistent definitions of abuse pose challenges for creating screening instruments, especially for detecting abuse and neglect in elderly and vulnerable populations. Although there are significant challenges in this research field, additional studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of different postscreening interventions. For the elderly and vulnerable adult populations, good-quality randomized, controlled trials focusing on both screening and interventions are needed. Because many elderly and vulnerable adults may not have sufficient physical, mental, or financial abilities to engage in screening functions, instruments need to be framed around third-party responses. Other challenges to research in this population include legal requirements related to disclosure, underlying medical conditions, and dependence on the perpetrators. It is important to note that this includes patients who have dementia or other cognitive deficiencies, as well as those with developmental disabilities. The USPSTF recognizes that these patients are particularly vulnerable to abuse because most live in a care-taking environment. Another important gap recognized by the USPSTF is the absence of evidence of effective interventions for middle-aged women who are past childbearing age but not yet elderly. Similar to the research needs for elderly and vulnerable adult populations, research is also needed to inform practice for this group of women. In addition, the USPSTF recognizes that a significant body of evidence is lacking for other populations, especially men. The CDC has conducted studies demonstrating the prevalence and importance of IPV against men perpetrated by women and other men. Research is needed in all areas related to screening and treatment in men, as well as reporting, safety, community linkages and supports, legal ramifications, and cultural aspects.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/ipvelder/ipvelderfinalrs.htm#consider,124,"The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that physicians screen all women for IPV. For women who are not pregnant, screening should occur at routine obstetric&ndash;gynecology visits, family planning visits, and preconception visits. For women who are pregnant, screening should occur over the course of the pregnancy, including at the first prenatal visit, at least once per trimester, and at the postpartum checkup. The American Medical Association states that physicians should routinely inquire about physical, sexual, and psychological abuse as part of the medical history. Physicians should also consider abuse as a factor in the presentation of medical complaints because patients' experiences with interpersonal violence or abuse may adversely affect their health status or ability to adhere to medical recommendations. Other organizations, such as the American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of Emergency Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, and Emergency Nurses Association, all have statements encouraging clinicians to be especially aware of the dynamics of family violence and the risk factors commonly found with those experiencing IPV. Further, clinicians should be prepared to respond appropriately and refer patients to available community resources where possible. In addition to recommendations for screening for IPV in all patients, some groups have specific, targeted opinion statements on screening for all forms of abuse, including screening all elderly patients for abusive or violent treatment by family, caretakers, or others. The American Medical Association and the American Academy of Neurology both have specific position statements on screening elderly patients for abuse.","Burden of Disease

	Intimate partner violence is considered to be a significant and largely unaddressed public health problem. The CDC estimates that nearly 31% of women and 26% of men report experiencing some form of IPV in their lifetime and that approximately 25% of women and 14% of men have experienced the most severe types of IPV. On the basis of data from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 23.6% of women reported a lifetime history of suffering abuse in 20052.

	In 1 study, abuse occurred in 11% of postmenopausal women3. In another study, a range of 1.3% to 4.6% of pregnant women reported abuse during the pregnancy. In a large study in 1 health care system, the prevalence of abuse in the preceding year was 7.9%, and 14.7% in the preceding 5 years4. Many factors make it difficult to obtain true estimates of abuse. Because of the stigma of abuse, including fear, shame, and reprisal, many cases go unreported5, 6. Only a minority of women (35.6%) injured during their most recent rape or during their most recent physical assault (30.2%) actually received medical treatment of any kind7.

	Among older and vulnerable adults, a recent study estimated that 14% of noninstitutionalized older adults had experienced physical, psychological, or sexual abuse; neglect; or financial exploitation during the past year34. Women with disabilities are 4 times more likely to experience sexual assault in the past year than women without disabilities35.

	Risk Factors

	The CDC has developed a comprehensive list of risk factors for IPV, which are organized into 4 categories36: individual (such as low self-esteem), relationship (such as marital conflict and instability), community (such as poverty and associated factors), and societal (such as traditional gender roles).

	Scope of Review

	In updating its 2004 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review on screening women for IPV and elderly and vulnerable adults for abuse and neglect. This review examined the accuracy of 14 screening tools for identifying IPV. Published literature on randomized, controlled trials and other systematic reviews were searched for evidence on the benefits and harms of screening adult women of childbearing age and elderly and vulnerable adults.

	Accuracy of Screening Tests

	This review37 included a total of 15 studies of 13 screening instruments to identify IPV in women, and 3 met criteria for good quality38-42. Most of the tools assessed current or past abuse rather than risk factors for future abuse.

	All of the screening instruments include questions for patients and are administered in a variety of ways: self-administered on paper or by computer, or interviews by various clinicians. Examples of questions from the instruments are “In the past year, have you ever been afraid of a partner?” and “Have you ever been in a relationship where your partner pushed or slapped you?”

	The 6 tools that achieved the highest levels of sensitivity and specificity were HITS (English and Spanish versions), OVAT, STaT, HARK, modified CTQ-SF, and WAST37. Limitations of the studies were high attrition rates, enrollment of dissimilar groups at baseline, and unclear application of the reference standard. A major limitation of the evidence is the lack of an established gold standard; all of the studies compared the screening instrument with a second instrument that was usually validated and often more detailed37.

	One study evaluated the 4-item HITS instrument by comparing it with 2 others: the Index of Spouse Abuse (ISA) and the Spanish version of WAST. In a sample of women attending a family practice clinic, the sensitivity and specificity were 86% and 99% for the English version and 100% and 86% for the Spanish version, respectively.

	The OAS, a 5-item instrument measuring current and past abuse, had sensitivity and specificity of 60% and 90% when compared with ISA in emergency department patients. This instrument was edited to a 4-item version, OVAT, which demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 93% and 86% in the same population. A subsequent study comparing OVAT with ISA among patients presenting to an emergency department also reported high sensitivity and specificity (86% and 83%).

	The 3-item STaT instrument was evaluated among women presenting to primary care clinics in 2 studies. Compared with a semistructured interview, STaT demonstrated sensitivity ranging from 62% to 96% and specificity ranging from 37% to 100%, depending on the reference standard and number of positive responses.

	The 4-item HARK instrument was compared with the Composite Abuse Scale (CAS) among women presenting to primary care in London, United Kingdom. For a positive response on any question, the sensitivity and specificity were 81% and 95%.

	Two items from CTQ-SF, an instrument designed to detect a history of physical or sexual abuse in childhood, were compared with the Evaluation of Lifetime Stressors structured interview among women in a health maintenance organization. With use of a single item from CTQ-SF, sensitivity and specificity were 70% and 94% for physical abuse and 82% and 89% for sexual abuse. Use of 2 items to screen for physical or sexual abuse resulted in sensitivity and specificity of 85% and 88%.

	Results from WAST were compared with CAS results for 2,461 women presenting to family practices, emergency departments, and women's health clinics in Canada. Sensitivity and specificity of WAST were 47% and 96%. In a subsequent study of a larger sample of women from Canadian clinics, WAST demonstrated higher sensitivity (81% to 88%) and specificity (89%), with CAS again used as the reference standard. In that study, WAST identified a 12-month prevalence rate of 22%, whereas CAS found a rate of 14%.

	The ages of the women participating in these studies ranged from 18 to 64 years.

	Effectiveness of Early Detection

	The USPSTF found that effective interventions to reduce IPV, abuse, and physical or mental harms consist of a number of approaches. Most of the studies were conducted with women of childbearing age in settings providing services for pregnancy or pregnancy prevention. Limitations of the studies were enrollment of dissimilar groups at baseline, high and/or differential loss to followup, recall bias, missing data, and the Hawthorne effect among control participants.

	A large cluster randomized, controlled trial of the effectiveness of screening for IPV included 6,743 Canadian women randomly assigned to screening or usual care groups. Primary outcomes were exposure to abuse and quality of life in the 18 months after screening. Secondary outcomes included depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, alcohol and drug abuse, mental and physical health, and use of health and social services. These outcomes were not significantly different between women in the screened versus usual care groups. Given the limited evidence in screening trials, the USPSTF considered the chain of evidence linking screening and improved outcomes from effective intervention studies.

	Five randomized, controlled trials of fair or good quality were found. Trials assessed interventions to reduce exposure to IPV, physical and mental harms, or mortality in women of childbearing age. One good-quality trial compared usual care with prenatal and postpartum behavioral counseling for 1,044 African American patients who were pregnant or postpartum. The counseling emphasized safety behaviors and information on community resources. Intimate partner violence was one of several outcomes measured using an anonymous computer interview. Women in the intervention group had significantly fewer episodes of IPV during pregnancy and postpartum, as well as better birth outcomes (fewer premature neonates). Although the intervention was targeted to African American women, the USPSTF determined that the potential benefit from the intervention could apply to other populations as well. Women in the intervention group had fewer recurrent episodes of IPV during pregnancy and postpartum (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.48 [95% CI, 0.29–0.80])13.

	One fair-quality trial evaluated a 3-year home visitation program with 685 mothers who gave birth to an infant determined to be at risk for maltreatment. The visits were conducted by paraprofessionals from 3 community agencies, with a focus on promoting child health and decreasing child maltreatment by linking families to community services. The average number of home visits in the first year was 13.6. In addition to receiving emotional support, parents were taught about child development and received role modeling, positive parenting, and problem-solving strategies. The intervention group had lower rates of IPV victimization and perpetration and lower rates of physical assault victimization and perpetration. No differences in sexual violence, verbal abuse, and injury were found43.

	In a trial evaluating a mentoring support program versus usual care, outcomes measured were abuse, depression, well-being, parenting stress, and social support. The trial enrolled women in primary care clinics who disclosed IPV or had behavioral symptoms suggestive of abuse. Abuse scores were significantly reduced in the intervention versus comparison groups. Differences for the other outcomes were not significant44.

	Pregnancy coercion is defined as a lack of control over a woman's reproductive health, including compromised decision making or limited ability to use contraception and family planning and fear of condom negotiation45. One trial compared a counseling intervention to reduce abuse related to pregnancy coercion with usual care. Women in the intervention group who reported IPV at baseline had decreased pregnancy coercion and were more likely to discontinue an unhealthy or unsafe relationship compared with women receiving usual care, regardless of recent IPV status45.

	In another trial,women were randomly assigned to receive a referral card with a safety plan and resources for IPV services or a 20-minute nurse case management protocol (March of Dimes) that included a brochure with a 15-item safety plan, supportive care, anticipatory guidance, and guided referrals46. Both study groups reported fewer threats of abuse, assaults, danger risks for homicide, and events of work harassment when compared with baseline.

	The estimated cost of implementing the interventions studied varies widely. For example, the counseling intervention13 achieving the best results would require fewer resources than some of the interventions requiring new technology.

	Potential Harms of Screening and Interventions

	Fourteen studies evaluated the adverse effects of screening and interventions. Eleven of the studies were descriptive in design and 3 were randomized, controlled trials. Of the latter 3, 1 was a large trial of 6,743 women that evaluated screening versus no screening and found no harms. Two trials reported no statistically significant harms compared with the nonintervention groups. The other studies were all descriptive in design, but none reported harms from screening.

	Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit

	The USPSTF determined that screening and interventions for IPV in women of childbearing age are associated with moderate health improvements through the reduction of exposure to abuse, as well as physical and mental harms and mortality. The overall associated harms were deemed no greater than small. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the overall net benefit is moderate. The USPSTF determined that the studies were highly consistent and that the interventions appeared to have dose–response effects.

	The USPSTF was not able to estimate the magnitude of net benefit for screening all elderly or vulnerable adults (physically or mentally dysfunctional) for abuse and neglect because there were no studies on the accuracy, effectiveness, or harms of screening.

	How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?

	The evidence on screening for IPV is based on a biopsychosocial framework rather than a pure biological model. As described by the CDC, IPV should be considered using a socioecological model, based on 4 specific elements: individual, relationship, community, and society36.

	There is ample evidence that a women's response to violence can cause a biological response and have lasting effects on health. In addition to the possible injuries that might occur, chronic conditions frequently associated with long-term exposure to stress are also possible. These include mental health conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and suicide. There are also various physical conditions that stem from IPV, such as chronic pain, neurological disorders (from injuries), gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, migraine headaches, and other disabilities.

	Response to Public Comments

	A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 12 June through 10 July 2012. Some comments expressed concerns about the lack of a focus on violence against men and other missed populations in the scope of this review. Additional comments highlighted the existence of new evidence that had been published since the initial review. Several comments requested information for additional resources or tools to assist providers in responding to patients experiencing IPV. Finally, some comments focused on the exclusion of women age 46 years and older in the recommendation. In response to these comments, the USPSTF acknowledged the prevalence of abuse against men and agreed that in addition to women older than age 46 years and the elderly, there are many understudied issues. The USPSTF also included specific information in the statement to help providers find additional resources and tools.",,Screening for Intimate Partner Violence & Abuse of Elderly & Vulnerable Adults,"Intimate Partner Violence & Abuse of Elderly & Vulnerable Adults, Screening, 2012"
"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults and adolescents who are at increased risk for syphilis infection. Screening for syphilis in nonpregnant populations is an important public health approach to preventing the sexual transmission of syphilis and subsequent vertical transmission of congenital syphilis.</p>
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
<p>The USPSTF recommends screening for syphilis in persons who are at increased risk for infection. Based on 2014 surveillance data,<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;men who have sex with men (MSM) and men and women living with HIV have the highest risk for syphilis infection; 61.1% of cases of primary and secondary syphilis occurred among MSM, and approximately one-half of all MSM diagnosed with syphilis were also coinfected with HIV. One study found that rates of syphilis coinfection were 5 times higher in MSM living with HIV compared with men living with HIV who do not have sex with men.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation4"">4</a>&nbsp;Based on older study data from northern California, the adjusted relative risk for syphilis infection in persons living with HIV (vs those without HIV) was 86.0 (95% CI, 78.6 to 94.1); 97% of those living with HIV and with incident syphilis were male.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation5"">5</a>When deciding which other persons to screen for syphilis, clinicians should be aware of the prevalence of infection in the communities they serve, as well as other sociodemographic factors that may be associated with increased risk of syphilis infection. Factors associated with increased prevalence that clinicians should consider include history of incarceration, history of commercial sex work, certain racial/ethnic groups, and being a male younger than 29 years, as well as regional variations that are well described. Men accounted for 90.8% of all cases of primary and secondary syphilis in 2014. Men aged 20 to 29 years had the highest prevalence rate, nearly 3 times higher than that in the average US male population.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;Syphilis prevalence rates are also higher in certain racial/ethnic groups (among both men and women); in 2014, prevalence rates of primary and secondary syphilis were 18.9 cases per 100,000 black individuals, 7.6 cases per 100,000 Hispanic individuals, 7.6 cases per 100,000 American Indian/Alaska Native individuals, 6.5 cases per 100,000 Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander individuals, 3.5 cases per 100,000 white individuals, and 2.8 cases per 100,000 Asian individuals.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;The southern United States comprises the largest proportion of syphilis cases (41%); however, the case rate is currently highest in the western United States (7.9 cases per 100,000 persons). Metropolitan areas in general have increased prevalence rates of syphilis.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;Risk factors for syphilis often do not present independently and may frequently overlap. In addition, local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area.Although direct evidence on screening among nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low. Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.</p>
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
<p>Current screening tests for syphilis rely on detection of antibodies rather than direct detection of the organism. Screening for syphilis infection is a 2-step process involving an initial nontreponemal test (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] or rapid plasma reagin [RPR] test) followed by a confirmatory treponemal antibody detection test (fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption [FTA-ABS] or&nbsp;<em>Treponema pallidum</em>particle agglutination [TPPA] test). A reverse sequence screening algorithm has been developed in which an automated treponemal test (such as enzyme-linked, chemiluminescence, or multiplex flow immunoassays) is performed first, followed by a nontreponemal test. If the test results are discordant in the reverse sequence algorithm, a second treponemal test (preferably using a different treponemal antibody) is performed.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation6"">6</a>There is limited evidence on the accuracy of screening using the reverse sequence algorithm. Findings from 2 studies suggest that using a reverse sequence algorithm may detect additional cases of syphilis missed by the usual algorithm.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation7"">7</a>&nbsp;However, the clinical significance of these additional cases is unclear, and more studies are needed to better understand the implications of using a reverse sequence algorithm for screening in a primary care setting. Newer screening technologies that include rapid syphilis tests are also currently emerging. These tests have the potential to be performed in nontraditional and nonclinical settings; however, more evidence is needed on the effectiveness of these tests as part of a screening program in a primary care setting.</p>
<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>
<p>The optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established. Men who have sex with men or persons living with HIV may benefit from more frequent screening. Initial studies suggest that detection of syphilis infection in MSM or persons living with HIV improves when screening is performed every 3 months compared with annually.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation7"">7</a></p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>In its 2015 guidelines on the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends parenteral penicillin G benzathine for the treatment of syphilis. Dosage and route may vary depending on the stage of disease and patient characteristics. To obtain the most up-to-date information, clinicians are encouraged to access the CDC website.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation8"">8</a></p>
<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>
<p>Public health agencies and local health departments have a critical role in the prevention and treatment of syphilis. Local health departments are often responsible for investigating incident cases of syphilis and identifying potential contacts who may need further testing or treatment. Primary care clinicians should be aware of applicable local public health laws and reporting requirements for syphilis cases.</p>
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
<p>Persons who are at risk for or have been diagnosed with syphilis infection may engage in behavior that increases their risk for other sexually transmitted infections. The USPSTF has made a separate recommendation on screening for syphilis in pregnant women, as well as screening for HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia in sexually active adolescents and adults and behavioral counseling interventions to prevent sexually transmitted infections (available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).</p>",,169,"<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Although testing for syphilis in persons living with HIV may be part of HIV management care provided in a specialty setting, screening for syphilis is often conducted in primary care settings, and primary care clinicians are encouraged to routinely screen their patients who are living with HIV.</p>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
<p>Studies are needed that directly evaluate the effectiveness of screening for syphilis on related morbidity and mortality in other high-risk populations, in addition to MSM and persons living with HIV, as well as studies that help identify optimal screening intervals. Studies in adolescent populations are particularly needed. In addition, studies that evaluate the effectiveness of risk assessment instruments or other methods to identify persons who are at increased risk and who may benefit from screening are needed. Further, studies on the diagnostic accuracy of reverse sequence screening algorithms in well-defined patient populations are needed, as well as studies on the interpretation and management of discrepant serology results (such as a positive automated treponemal test, negative nontreponemal test, and positive second treponemal test).</p>
<h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendations</h2>
<p>This recommendation is consistent with and updates the 2004 USPSTF recommendation. The current recommendation statement includes updated information on prevalence and risk factors in the United States and data on newer screening tests and approaches. Screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women is now addressed in a separate recommendation statement.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation3"">3</a></p>
<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2>
<p>The CDC recommends at least annual screening for sexually active MSM with confirmatory testing for individuals with reactive serology. Persons living with HIV should be screened at least annually; more frequent screening may be appropriate based on individual risk behaviors and local epidemiology. The CDC also recommends syphilis screening in correctional facilities on the basis of the local area and institutional prevalence.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation9"">9</a>&nbsp;The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists endorses the CDC&rsquo;s guidelines.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation20"">20</a>&nbsp;The HIV Medicine Association (part of the Infectious Diseases Society of America) recommends that all patients living with HIV be screened for syphilis on initiation of care and periodically thereafter, depending on risk.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation21"">21</a>&nbsp;The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation22"">22</a></p>","Burden of Disease
Syphilis is a chronic, systemic infectious disease caused by the bacterium T pallidum. Left untreated, syphilis can progress through the following stages: primary, secondary, latent (early and late), and tertiary disease. Syphilis infection of the nervous system (neurosyphilis) can occur at any stage. Although not always present or noticed by patients, manifestations of primary syphilis include ulcers or a single chancre at the infection site. Manifestations of secondary syphilis include rash, mucocutaneous lesions, and lymphadenopathy. Manifestations of tertiary syphilis include inflammatory lesions of the cardiovascular system (eg, aortitis or coronary vessel disease), skin (eg, gummatous lesions), bone (eg, osteitis), or other tissue. Rarely, other structures may be involved. Manifestations of early neurosyphilis include cranial nerve dysfunction, meningitis stroke, acute altered mental status, and auditory or ophthalmic abnormalities; late neurologic manifestations include tabes dorsalis and general paresis and can occur 10 to 30 years after initial infection.9 Syphilis can be sexually transmitted during the early stages of infection (primary, secondary, and early-latent syphilis); reported transmission rates range from 15.9% to 30.3%.10, 11 Congenital or vertical transmission may occur at any stage. Syphilis infection increases the risk for acquiring or transmitting HIV if exposed;1 among persons living with HIV, syphilis infection is associated with a subsequent increase in HIV viral load and decrease in CD4 cell counts.12-14
In 2014, the total number of syphilis cases reported for all stages (including 458 cases of congenital syphilis) and all ages in the United States was 63,450, which is a 12.3% increase from the previous year. The case count (19,999 cases) and case rate (6.3 cases per 100,000 persons) of primary and secondary syphilis were the highest reported since 1994. All but 24 cases occurred in persons 15 years and older. Among men, the rate of primary and secondary syphilis has increased every year since 2000; however, among women, the rate of primary and secondary syphilis has fluctuated between 0.8 and 1.7 cases per 100,000 since 2000. During 2013–2014, the rate among men increased 14.4%, from 10.2 to 11.7 cases per 100,000; among women, the rate increased 22.7%, from 0.9 to 1.1 cases per 100,000.1 The majority of cases of primary and secondary syphilis still occur among MSM. In 2014, there were 23,541 cases (7.4 cases per 100,000 persons) of late and late-latent syphilis.1 More recently, the CDC has reported an increase in cases of ocular syphilis, with more than 200 cases reported in 20 states since 2014, the majority of which have been among MSM living with HIV.15
Scope of Review
The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review7, 16 of studies published since it previously reviewed the evidence on this topic in 2004.17 The USPSTF also considered evidence from its previous evidence review. Included studies had to be applicable to the United States, as determined by the similarity of study participants and availability of health care services and screening tests in the study setting. The review focused on screening for syphilis infection in asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults and adolescents, including patients coinfected with other sexually transmitted infections (such as HIV).
Accuracy of Screening Tests
Screening for syphilis is usually a 2-step process. A nontreponemal test (RPR or VDRL) is performed first, followed by a treponemal test (TPPA or FTA-ABS) if the first nontreponemal test result is positive. Positive results on both tests indicate past or present syphilis infection. Estimated sensitivities of the RPR and VDRL tests are 86% and 78%, respectively, for detecting primary syphilis infection; 100% for detecting secondary syphilis infection; and 98% and 96% for detecting latent syphilis infection, respectively.7 Specificity ranges from 85% to 99% and may be reduced in persons who have a preexisting condition (ie, collagen vascular disease, pregnancy, intravenous drug use, advanced malignancy, tuberculosis, malaria, or viral and rickettsial diseases) that may produce false-positive results.7 The TPPA and FTA-ABS tests have a sensitivity of 88% and 84%, respectively, for detecting primary syphilis infection and almost 100% for detecting other stages, and a specificity of 96% to 97%, respectively.7
Screening yield using the 2-step process (RPR followed by confirmatory FTA-ABS) can be estimated using test characteristics and the incidence of syphilis infection in a given population. For example, in the general population (assuming prevalence of 5 cases per 100,000 persons, RPR sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 95%, and FTA-ABS sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 96%), more than 24,000 patients would have to be screened to detect a single case of syphilis infection; further, 200 per 100,000 persons screened would have false-positive results. In a high-risk population (assuming prevalence of 12%, RPR sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 95%, and FTA-ABS sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 96%), 10 patients would have to be screened to detect a single case of syphilis infection; almost 2,000 per 100,000 persons screened would have false-negative results.7
More recently, automated treponemal tests have been developed, including enzyme-linked, chemiluminescence, and multiplex flow immunoassays. Reported sensitivity ranges from 64% to 100% (depending on stage of disease and type of test used), and specificity ranges from 95.4% to 99.9%.7 These automated treponemal tests are often used in a reverse sequence screening algorithm, in which an automated treponemal test is performed first, followed by a nontreponemal test (quantitative) if the first automated treponemal test result is positive. A positive result on both the automated treponemal and the nontreponemal test indicates past or present syphilis infection. If the result of the automated treponemal test is positive but the nontreponemal test result is negative, a second treponemal test (TPPA, FTA-ABS, or other) is performed; a positive result on the second treponemal test indicates past or present syphilis infection.6
The USPSTF reviewed 2 studies that compared a reverse sequence screening algorithm with the traditional 2-step approach to screening.18, 19 One study was conducted in a low-prevalence US population19 and the other in a high-prevalence metropolitan area in Canada.18 Although both studies found that more cases were detected using the reverse sequence algorithm, use of the reverse sequence algorithm was associated with a higher false-positive rate. Overall, more studies on the reverse sequence screening algorithm are needed before definitive conclusions can be made on its effectiveness.
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment
Based on CDC data,1 MSM and persons living with HIV are at highest risk for syphilis infection. In 2014, the majority of cases (61.1%) of primary and secondary syphilis occurred among MSM, and approximately one-half of all MSM diagnosed with syphilis were also coinfected with HIV. Increased prevalence of syphilis infection was also associated with certain racial/ethnic groups (black, Hispanic, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander individuals had higher prevalence rates than white individuals, ranging from 6.5 to 18.9 vs 3.5 cases per 100,000 persons), geography (southern and western United States and metropolitan areas), and being a male younger than 29 years.1
The USPSTF found no recent studies on the direct effectiveness of screening for syphilis in asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults and adolescents to reduce complications or transmission of syphilis infection or acquisition of other sexually transmitted infections. Older clinical trials and observational studies and almost 50 years of clinical experience provide evidence that penicillin is effective in the treatment of syphilis infection.9 Penicillin G has long been an effective and accepted regimen for the treatment of all stages of syphilis infection, and new trials are focusing on antibiotics that are easier to administer or are alternatives for patients who are allergic to penicillin. Data on these alternative regimens are limited.9 Given the well-documented risk factors associated with increased prevalence of syphilis infection and the availability of accurate screening tests and treatment, the USPSTF found overall that screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection is effective.
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
No studies directly evaluated the harms of screening. Potential harms of screening include opportunity costs to the clinician and patient (eg, time and resources) and false-positive results that may lead to stress, labeling, and further diagnostic workup. Harms of treatment include rare adverse drug-related effects, such as anaphylaxis due to penicillin allergy and the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (febrile reaction with headache, myalgia, and other symptoms), which may occur within the first 24 hours after any syphilis therapy.9
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
Overall, the USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening for syphilis infection in asymptomatic, nonpregnant persons who are at increased risk for infection provides substantial benefit. Accurate screening tests are available to identify syphilis infection in populations at increased risk. Effective treatment with antibiotics can prevent progression to late-stage disease, with small associated harms, providing an overall substantial health benefit.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from December 15, 2015 to January 18, 2016. A few comments sought clarification on which populations were considered to be at increased risk. The USPSTF added language to the Clinical Considerations section to clarify that men and women living with HIV who are not MSM are considered to be at increased risk for syphilis. In addition, men and women (and not just young men) who have identified sociodemographic risk factors associated with increased prevalence rates of syphilis may be considered at increased risk as well. In response to public comments, the USPSTF provided updated surveillance data from 2014. A few comments also requested additional information on various screening tests. However, these tests are outside the scope of this recommendation for various reasons (eg, diagnostic tests performed in symptomatic patients or newer technologies not yet evaluated for screening in a primary care setting).","<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>The number of cases of primary and secondary syphilis have increased since 2000. In 2014, 19,999 cases (6.3 cases per 100,000 persons) of primary and secondary syphilis were reported in the United States.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;Left untreated, syphilis can progress to late-stage disease in approximately 15% of persons who are infected.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation2"">2</a>&nbsp;Consequences of late-stage syphilis include development of inflammatory lesions throughout the body (eg, aortitis, gummatous lesions, and osteitis), which can lead to cardiovascular or organ dysfunction. Syphilis infection of the central nervous system (neurosyphilis) can occur at any stage of disease and can result in blindness, paresis, tabes dorsalis, and dementia. Syphilis infection also increases the risk for acquiring or transmitting HIV infection.The USPSTF addresses screening for syphilis in pregnant women in a separate recommendation statement.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation3"">3</a></p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>There are numerous screening tests for syphilis. Most common is a combination of nontreponemal and treponemal antibody tests. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening algorithms with high sensitivity and specificity are available to accurately detect syphilis.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that treatment with antibiotics can lead to substantial health benefits in nonpregnant persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection by curing syphilis infection, preventing manifestations of late-stage disease, and preventing sexual transmission to others.</p>
<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found no direct evidence on the harms of screening for syphilis in nonpregnant persons who are at increased risk for infection. Potential harms of screening include false-positive results that require clinical evaluation, unnecessary anxiety to the patient, and the potential stigma of having a sexually transmitted infection. The harms of antibiotic treatment are well established, and the magnitude of these harms is no greater than small.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of screening for syphilis infection in nonpregnant persons who are at increased risk for infection is substantial.</p>",Screening for Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adults and Adolescents,"Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adults and Adolescents, Screening, 2016"
"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
These recommendations apply to adolescents, adults, and pregnant women. Screening for HIV infection could begin at age 15 years unless an individual is identified at an earlier age with risk factors for HIV infection. Screening after age 65 years is indicated if there is ongoing risk for HIV infection, as indicated by risk assessment (for example, new sexual partners).
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
According to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), men who have sex with men account for about 60% of HIV-positive persons in the United States. Among men living with HIV infection who were diagnosed at age 13 years or older, 68% of infections are attributed to male-to-male sexual contact, 8% are attributed to male-to-male sexual contact and injection drug use, and 11% are attributed to heterosexual contact. Among women living with HIV infection, 74% of infections are attributed to heterosexual contact and the remainder to injection drug use. According to the CDC, heterosexual contact accounted for an estimated 25% of new HIV infections in 2010 and 27% of existing infections in 2009. Data from the CDC on HIV prevalence in different subpopulations are available at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance"">www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance</a>.On the basis of HIV prevalence data, the USPSTF considers men who have sex with men and active injection drug users to be at very high risk for new HIV infection. Behavioral risk factors for HIV infection include having unprotected vaginal or anal intercourse; having sexual partners who are HIV-infected, bisexual, or injection drug users; or exchanging sex for drugs or money. Other persons at high risk include those who have acquired or request testing for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Patients may request HIV testing in the absence of reported risk factors. Individuals not at increased risk for HIV infection include persons who are not sexually active, those who are sexually active in exclusive monogamous relationships with uninfected partners, and those who do not fall into any of the aforementioned categories. The USPSTF recognizes that these categories are not mutually exclusive, the degree of sexual risk is on a continuum, and individuals may not be aware of their sexual partners' risk factors for HIV infection. For patients younger than 15 years and older than 65 years, it would be reasonable for clinicians to consider HIV risk factors among individual patients, especially those with new sexual partners. However, clinicians should bear in mind that adolescent and adult patients may be reluctant to disclose having HIV risk factors, even when asked.
<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>
The evidence is insufficient to determine optimum time intervals for HIV screening. One reasonable approach would be one-time screening of adolescent and adult patients to identify persons who are already HIV-positive, with repeated screening of those who are known to be at risk for HIV infection, those who are actively engaged in risky behaviors, and those who live or receive medical care in a high-prevalence setting. According to the CDC, a high-prevalence setting is a geographic location or community with an HIV seroprevalence of at least 1%. These settings include sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics, correctional facilities, homeless shelters, tuberculosis clinics, clinics serving men who have sex with men, and adolescent health clinics with a high prevalence of STDs. Patient populations that would more likely benefit from more frequent testing include those who are known to be at higher risk for HIV infection, those who are actively engaged in risky behaviors, and those who live in a high-prevalence setting. Given the paucity of available evidence for specific screening intervals, a reasonable approach may be to rescreen groups at very high risk (see <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/hiv/hivfinalrs.htm#risk"">Assessment of Risk</a>) for new HIV infection at least annually and individuals at increased risk at somewhat longer intervals (for example, 3 to 5 years). Routine rescreening may not be necessary for individuals who have not been at increased risk since they were found to be HIV-negative. Women screened during a previous pregnancy should be rescreened in subsequent pregnancies.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
The conventional serum test for diagnosing HIV infection is the repeatedly reactive immunoassay followed by confirmatory Western blot or immunofluorescent assay. The test is highly accurate (sensitivity and specificity, &gt;99.5%), and results are available within 1 to 2 days from most commercial laboratories.Rapid HIV testing may use either blood or oral fluid specimens and can provide results in 5 to 40 minutes. The sensitivity and specificity of the rapid test are also both greater than 99.5%; however, initial positive results require confirmation with conventional methods.Other U.S. Food and Drug Administration&ndash;approved tests for detection and confirmation of HIV infection include combination tests (for p24 antigen and HIV antibodies) and qualitative HIV-1 RNA.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
No cure for chronic HIV infection currently exists. However, appropriately timed interventions in HIV-positive persons can reduce risks for clinical progression, complications or death from the disease, and disease transmission. Effective interventions include ART (specifically, the use of combined ART, defined as &ge;3 antiretroviral agents used together, usually from &ge;2 classes), immunizations, and prophylaxis for opportunistic infections.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
The USPSTF recognizes that the most effective strategy for reducing HIV-related morbidity and mortality in the United States is primary prevention or avoidance of exposure to HIV infection. Condom use can also substantially decrease the risk for transmission of HIV and other STIs. The USPSTF recommends high-intensity behavioral counseling to prevent STIs for all sexually active adolescents and for adults at increased risk for infection. More information can be found at <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsstds.htm"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsstds.htm</a>. The Community Preventive Services Task Force has made several recommendations related to the prevention of HIV, AIDS, and other STIs, including person-to-person behavioral interventions (information and skill building to change knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and self-efficacy) for men who have sex with men that can be implemented at the individual, group, or community level. It also recommends health provider notification and encouragement for HIV testing for sexual or needle-sharing partners of individuals diagnosed with HIV, as well as comprehensive risk reduction interventions in adolescents.

<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
For populations in which the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV infection is known to be 0.1% or less (that is, &le;1 person in 1,000 is HIV-positive), where the potential benefit per person screened is low, it is reasonable to forgo routine HIV screening and instead screen on the basis of risk assessment. The CDC suggests that for populations in which the prevalence of HIV infection has not been documented, clinicians should initiate voluntary routine screening. If no HIV-infected patients are found after screening of approximately 4,000 patients, the upper limit of the 95% CI for prevalence is less than 0.1%&nbsp;and routine screening may be discontinued and replaced with risk-based screening. The USPSTF concurs with the CDC's recommendation that HIV screening should be voluntary and done only with the patient's knowledge and understanding. Patients should be informed orally or in writing that HIV testing will be performed unless they decline (opt-out screening). The USPSTF further concurs with the CDC's recommendation that before HIV testing, patients should receive an explanation of HIV infection and the meaning of positive and negative test results. Patients should also be offered the opportunity to ask questions and to decline testing. The CDC's recommendations on HIV testing in adults, adolescents, and pregnant women in health care settings are available at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5514a1.htm"">www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5514a1.htm</a>.
<h3>Cost-Effectiveness Analysis</h3>
The USPSTF's deliberations on grade recommendations for the effectiveness of clinical preventive services do not include cost or cost-effectiveness considerations. For policy context, however, the USPSTF reviewed some cost-effectiveness analyses published since its previous review. These analyses, which include downstream costs, support the cost-effectiveness of HIV screening in settings with low or average HIV prevalence. No studies directly compared universal versus targeted screening in low-prevalence populations or explicitly considered the potential long-term cardiovascular harms of ART.
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Individuals who begin ART tend to continue receiving it for an extended length of time. Better evidence is needed about the long-term harms of ART, including risks for cardiovascular and kidney disease. Further follow-up is necessary to better delineate potential long-term harms of ART initiation at higher CD4 cell counts. It would also be helpful to better elucidate the potential risks and long-term outcomes associated with in utero or perinatal exposure to ART. Antiretroviral treatment guidelines are regularly updated and available at <a href=""http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines"">http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines</a>. Direct evidence of the effectiveness of ART and behavioral counseling in reducing HIV transmission among men who have sex with men and other high-risk groups could also guide prevention and treatment strategies. Similarly, additional studies are needed to better define the optimum timing for treatment initiation. More research is needed about the differential effects of various HIV screening strategies on testing acceptability and uptake, linkage to and receipt of care, and harms. Information that could quantify any incremental benefits and harms of repeated HIV screening and identify ideal time intervals for rescreening in different populations would be useful.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/hiv/hivfinalrs.htm#consider,126,"In 2006, the CDC recommended routine voluntary HIV screening in all adolescents and adults aged 13 to 64 years regardless of other recognized risk factors, unless the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV infection has been documented to be less than 0.1%. The CDC also recommended opt-out HIV testing, meaning that all patients should be informed about and undergo testing unless they specifically decline, without a requirement for prevention counseling before screening in order to reduce barriers to testing. In 2009, the American College of Physicians endorsed the CDC's approach. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends routine HIV screening for all sexually active adults. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends routine opt-out screening in all women aged 19 to 64 years and targeted screening in women with risk factors outside of that age range. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends offering routine HIV testing to all adolescents at least once by age 16 to 18 years when HIV prevalence is greater than 0.1% in the community, as well as testing of all sexually active adolescents and those with risk factors in low-prevalence settings. The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends that clinicians screen adolescents and adults aged 18 to 65 years for HIV infection, as well as younger adolescents and older adults who are at increased risk.","Burden of Disease

	Since the first cases of AIDS were reported in 1981, nearly 600,000 persons in the United States have died from the condition10. Despite the decrease in AIDS cases and deaths after the introduction of ART, the CDC estimates that more than 1.1 million persons in the United States were living with HIV infection at the end of 2008, including 236,400 (20%) who did not know they were infected10. Risk factors for HIV infection include having unprotected vaginal or anal intercourse with more than one partner; having sexual partners who are HIV-infected, bisexual, or injection drug users; exchanging sex for drugs or money; or engaging in injection drug use. According to the CDC, late diagnosis of HIV infection is common. Among persons with newly diagnosed HIV in 2008, 33% developed AIDS within 1 year of initial HIV diagnosis1.

	Scope of Review

	In 2005, the USPSTF strongly recommended that clinicians screen for HIV in all adolescents and adults at increased risk for HIV infection, as well as all pregnant women11. The USPSTF found good evidence that standard and rapid HIV screening tests are highly accurate and that most ART-associated adverse events, including metabolic disturbances associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events, could be alleviated by changes in regimen or appropriate treatment. The USPSTF found good evidence that treatment of HIV-positive patients at immunologically advanced stages of disease (defined as a CD4 count <0.200 × 109 cells/L) results in markedly decreased risk for AIDS-related clinical events and death.

	At that time, the USPSTF made no recommendation for or against routine HIV screening in adolescents and adults not at increased risk for HIV infection. This was based largely on several considerations. First, the USPSTF determined that HIV screening in patients without known risk factors would yield less than targeted screening. It estimated that the benefits of HIV screening would be substantial in high-risk patients and settings but small for populations not at increased risk for infection. Second, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence that initiation of ART in patients with CD4 counts greater than 0.200 × 109 cells/L would result in improved clinical outcomes. Third, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence that knowledge of HIV-positive status would actually result in decreased HIV transmission, either through initiation of highly active ART or reductions in risky behaviors.

	For this update, the USPSTF reviewed new evidence on the effectiveness of treatments in HIV-infected persons with CD4 counts greater than 0.200 × 109 cells/L; effects of screening, counseling, and ART use on risky behaviors and HIV transmission risk; and long-term cardiovascular harms of ART.

	Accuracy of Screening Tests

	The 2005 USPSTF review found that standard and rapid HIV tests are highly accurate, with greater than 99.5% sensitivity and specificity11. However, studies indicate that in lower-prevalence settings, rapid testing is associated with a lower positive predictive value (that is, a decreased proportion of positive results that are “true” positives), although results are generally confirmed before treatment.

	Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment

	The 2005 USPSTF review found convincing evidence that initiation of ART in HIV-positive patients with CD4 counts less than 0.200 × 109 cells/L markedly reduces AIDS-related morbidity and mortality. At that time, however, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence to conclude that initiation of ART in patients with higher CD4 cell counts would result in improved clinical outcomes.

	To date, no randomized trials or observational studies have evaluated clinical outcomes among patients who are screened versus not screened for HIV infection, the yield of repeated versus one-time HIV screening, or the yield of different screening strategies (for example, risk-based vs. routine repeated screening). However, new evidence shows treatment benefits for HIV-positive patients with CD4 counts between 0.200 and 0.500 × 109cells/L, which dramatically increases the pool of patients that could benefit from early detection.

	Several studies show that initiation of ART at CD4 counts between 0.200 and 0.500 × 109 cells/L is associated with reduced risk for AIDS-related events or death. At this stage of HIV infection, patients are likely to be asymptomatic and detected via screening rather than clinical presentation.

	The updated USPSTF review found two good-quality randomized trials12, 13, one retrospective subgroup analysis from one randomized trial14, and five observational studies15-20 that evaluated clinical outcomes after initiation of ART at different CD4 cell count thresholds.

	The randomized, controlled trial with the largest population was the HPTN 052 (HIV Prevention Trials Network 052) study13, which compared mortality and clinical outcomes among 886 HIV-positive patients who received “early” ART (when CD4 counts were between 0.350 and 0.550 × 109 cells/L) with 877 HIV-positive patients who received “delayed” ART (after a decrease in CD4 count to ≤0.200 × 109 cells/L or symptom onset). This study was conducted in nine countries, with 54% of participants from Africa. It did not detect a significant difference in mortality between treatment groups. However, serious HIV-related clinical events, including death, were less likely among patients who received early treatment than among those who received delayed treatment (2.4 vs. 4.0 events/person-year; hazard ratio [HR], 0.59 [95% CI, 0.40 to 0.88]). According to the investigators, differences in the rates of serious HIV clinical events were driven largely by intergroup differences in the incidence of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, most of which were observed in India.

	Another randomized, open-label, controlled trial conducted in Haiti compared 408 HIV-positive patients who received “early” ART (when CD4 counts were between 0.201 and 0.350 × 109 cells/L) with 408 HIV-positive patients who received “standard” treatment (when CD4 counts were ≤0.200 × 109 cells/L)12. Deaths occurred more frequently in the standard treatment group than in the early treatment group (6% vs. 2%; HR, 4.0 [95% CI, 1.6 to 9.8]; P = 0.001), as did incident cases of tuberculosis (9% vs. 4%; HR, 2.0 [95% CI, 1.2 to 3.6]; P = 0.001). Because the study was not blinded, there may have been differential reporting and detection of nonfatal outcomes, which could affect progression to mortality. In addition, the study was conducted in a resource-poor setting with high rates of tuberculosis, malnutrition, and co-infection with tropical diseases, which limits the generalizability of the findings to the U.S. primary care population and may partially account for the large effect size. Accordingly, clinical benefits observed in the United States might not be as dramatic as those seen in these two trials.

	Data from a third large randomized trial conducted primarily in Europe and North America (the SMART [Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy] study)14 were reexamined in a post hoc exploratory analysis. In a retrospective subgroup analysis of 477 patients, initiation of ART at CD4 counts less than 0.250 × 109 cells/L was associated with increased risk for death or opportunistic disease compared with initiation at CD4 counts greater than 0.350 × 109 cells/L (2.7% vs. 0.5%; HR, 3.5 [95% CI, 1.3 to 9.6]; P = 0.02)14. Because this question was not part of the original study plan, the investigators acknowledged that their findings could be less reliable and warranted further confirmation.

	Fair-quality observational studies consistently found that initiation of ART at CD4 counts between 0.350 and 0.500 × 109 cells/L was associated with decreased risk for death (or a trend toward decreased risk) compared with deferred or no ART. Studies on initiation of ART at CD4 counts greater than 0.500 × 109 cells/L yielded less consistent results, as did studies of the combined outcome of death and AIDS-defining events. Limitations of these studies include insufficient information about baseline differences in patients who initiated ART at different CD4 cell count thresholds, suboptimum reporting of attrition, unblinded assessment of outcomes and analysis of data, and possible residual confounding.

	Recent studies have also shown that early initiation of ART can reduce risk for HIV transmission to uninfected sexual partners. The HPTN 052 study enrolled 1,763 serodiscordant couples (that is, one partner was HIV-positive and the other was HIV-negative), most of which were heterosexual. Patients with HIV who had CD4 counts between 0.350 and 0.550 × 109 cells/L were randomly assigned to receive early (immediate) or delayed ART (after a decrease in CD4 count to ≤0.200 × 109 cells/L or symptom onset). At a median follow-up of 1.7 years, with most couples reporting 100% condom use, the incidence of seroconversion in HIV-negative partners was significantly lower among those whose HIV-positive partners had received early rather than delayed ART (0.3 vs. 2.2 events/100 person-years; HR, 0.11 [95% CI, 0.04 to 0.32]; P < 0.001). Seven observational studies of heterosexual transmission included in the USPSTF review were consistent with the results of this randomized trial. The potential effects of ART on HIV transmission have not been well-studied and could be attenuated in men who have sex with men or other high-risk populations, which account for most HIV-infected individuals in the United States.

	Despite the potential effectiveness of ART as an HIV prevention strategy, it does not prevent the transmission of other STIs. Early diagnosis of HIV infection allows for risk reduction counseling and behavior change to reduce transmission of HIV and other STIs. In 2008, the USPSTF recommended high-intensity behavioral counseling to prevent STIs for all sexually active adolescents and for adults at increased risk for infection. The 2005 USPSTF review on screening for HIV included two systematic reviews that found consistent condom use to be associated with substantially reduced risk for sexual transmission of HIV infection; these findings have been confirmed in more recent observational studies. Self-reported condom use was associated with a 93% reduction in risk for heterosexual HIV transmission in a prospective cohort study (n = 476)21. Inconsistent condom use was associated with an 8-fold increase in risk for seroconversion in another study of 1,927 serodiscordant heterosexual couples (adjusted relative risk, 8.4 [95% CI, 4.8 to 15])22. In one modeling analysis, earlier initiation of ART combined with modifications in risky sexual behavior reduced new infections by up to 65%9.

	Observational studies included in the current USPSTF review found that knowledge of HIV-positive status was associated with reductions in several high-risk behaviors, including having unprotected intercourse, having sex in exchange for money or drugs, having sex with commercial sex workers, using intravenous drugs, and needle sharing among injection drug users. Reductions in high-risk behaviors occurred in all populations studied, including men who have sex with men, injection drug users, and heterosexual persons. Similarly, observational studies also reported no clear association between initiation of ART and high-risk sexual behaviors.

	In its deliberations about the age at which to begin screening, the USPSTF considered the prevalence of sexual activity and STDs among different age groups. According to CDC Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance data from 2011, nearly half of U.S. high school students had engaged in sexual intercourse and one third were currently sexually active23. Of students who had been sexually active, one third had engaged in sexual intercourse before age 16 years24. Although adolescents and young adults comprise one quarter of the sexually experienced population in the United States, they account for nearly one half of all cases of newly acquired STDs25. As such, routine HIV screening starting at age 15 years would be reasonable. Because HIV prevalence markedly decreases after age 65 years, routine screening may not be necessary in older patients.

	In its 2005 review, the USPSTF found convincing evidence that recommended regimens of ART resulted in significantly reduced rates of mother-to-child transmission. For its updated review, the USPSTF identified no new randomized trials of full-course combination ART during pregnancy in settings comparable to the United States. Three U.S. and European cohort studies published since 2005 found perinatal full-course triple ART to be associated with decreased risk for mother-to-child transmission (<1% to 2.4% among treated women vs. 9% to 22% among untreated women)26-28.

	Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment

	The USPSTF's previous systematic review found that true-positive HIV test results may result in anxiety, depression, social stigma, changes in relationships with sexual partners, and discrimination29. The USPSTF believes that patients who are diagnosed with HIV infection could benefit from counseling and ART. Because of the high specificity of conventional and rapid HIV testing strategies, false-positive test results are rare; reported rates of such results with conventional testing are 1 in 250,000 tests in low-prevalence populations30. Evidence about potential consequences of receiving a false-positive HIV test result (for example, anxiety, psychological distress, or labeling) is limited and largely anecdotal31. The actual consequences of initial false-positive rapid test results depend on whether patients are notified of these results before confirmatory testing. Most patients with initial positive results would not receive ART before confirmatory testing; one possible exception would be pregnant women in labor whose HIV status is unknown (described later). No studies directly evaluated psychological or other adverse effects associated with rapid versus conventional testing.

	In the randomized trials comparing clinical outcomes among patients who received early versus standard ART, severe or life-threatening drug reactions did not occur more frequently in the early treatment group after exclusion of primary clinical end points12.13.32. However, the early treatment group in the HPTN 052 study had ART-related adverse events more frequently (27% vs. 18%; P < 0.001), particularly grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities, which the study investigators described as having unclear clinical significance13.

	Individual antiretroviral drugs, drug classes, and combinations are all associated with short-term adverse events; many of these events are transient or self-limited, and effective alternatives are often available. Longer-term use of ART regimens may increase the risk for cardiovascular and bone disease, as well as liver, renal, lipid, and glucose abnormalities33. Aside from being potentially fatal, untreated HIV infection can contribute to these and other long-term complications34.

	A small increase in cardiovascular risk has been associated with specific protease inhibitors and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in observational studies. The estimates of risk and the drugs implicated vary among studies. The 2005 USPSTF review included results from the large, ongoing DAD (Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs) study, which found a 26% adjusted relative increase in the annual incidence of myocardial infarction during the first 4 to 6 years of exposure to ART (relative risk, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.12 to 1.41]; P < 0.001). In patients with more prolonged exposure to ART, the absolute risk for myocardial infarction was less than 0.6% and absolute event rates were low (3.5/1,000 person-years)35. Subsequent analyses from the DAD study36-38 and other cohort studies39, 40 also report cardiovascular harms associated with ART.

	In one study of rapid HIV testing of pregnant women in labor in a low-prevalence setting, infection was confirmed in 90% of women with positive test results. Because confirmatory testing is not available in time to inform emergent treatment decisions, a small percentage of HIV-negative mothers and their infants will potentially be exposed to the adverse effects of ART or surgical delivery.

	Since the prior USPSTF review, several cohort studies of perinatal exposure to ART have reported increased risk for late preterm delivery, with no clear association between maternal use of ART and low birth weight, congenital anomalies, or differences in neurodevelopmental outcomes. Other studies reported echocardiographic abnormalities, mitochondrial dysfunction, anemia, and neutropenia among infants exposed to ART. However, the clinical significance of these findings remains unclear. The 11 studies included in this review were considered fair or poor quality.

	Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit

	The USPSTF recognizes that the most effective overall strategy for reduction of HIV-related morbidity and mortality in the United States is primary prevention or avoidance of exposure to HIV infection. The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that early detection and treatment of HIV transmission would result in substantial public health benefits in the United States. According to CDC estimates, more than 1.1 million persons were living with HIV infection in the United States at the end of 2008, including 236,400 (20%) who did not know they were infected. Screening for HIV infection in all adolescents and adults aged 15 to 65 years, persons at increased risk for infection, and pregnant women would allow for earlier and expanded detection of HIV infection, thus creating opportunities for earlier linkages to medical and behavioral interventions.

	In the USPSTF's view, earlier initiation of ART in HIV-positive persons with CD4 counts less than 0.500 × 109 cells/L could substantially reduce disease burden in the United States. At an ART initiation threshold of a CD4 count of 0.500 × 109 cells/L, approximately 60 persons would need to be treated to prevent 1 death from HIV infection after 3 years. The USPSTF found good evidence that this intervention in this population could improve clinical outcomes and reduce sexual transmission. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of early detection and treatment of HIV infection are small and the clinical benefits of ART substantially outweigh potential risks of treatment in HIV-positive patients with CD4 counts less than 0.500 × 109 cells/L. The USPSTF also found convincing evidence that screening for HIV in pregnant women would confer substantial clinical benefits, with adequate evidence that the potential harms would be small.

	The expected magnitude of benefit of HIV screening to an overall population is dependent, in part, on the frequency with which the disease occurs in that population. More individuals may benefit from routine HIV screening in a setting where HIV infection is more prevalent because the pool of affected individuals in which interventions could have a positive effect is larger. At the same time, an accurate assessment of the prevalence of HIV infection in a given geographic location may not be readily available, and in some cases, it can be difficult to reliably determine which individuals are actually at increased risk for HIV infection. Studies have shown that screening for HIV on the basis of risk factor assessment alone may miss 20% to 25% of HIV-positive individuals who report no risk factors.

	On the basis of these findings, the USPSTF concludes with high certainty that early detection and treatment of HIV infection would result in substantial net benefit in the United States.

	How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?

	Late diagnosis of HIV infection is common. In 2008, one third of persons newly diagnosed with HIV developed AIDS within 1 year of diagnosis; according to the CDC, these persons had probably been infected for an average of 10 years before diagnosis. Moreover, 1 of 5 persons living with HIV infection did not know that they were infected10. The long preclinical phase from HIV infection to symptom onset allows for the opportunity to screen, identify, and treat persons with HIV infection in order to reduce HIV-related morbidity and transmission. Reduction in viral load with ART can result in improved clinical outcomes for HIV-infected individuals and reduce transmission to uninfected persons.

	Response to Public Comments

	A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 19 November 2012 through 20 December 2012. In response to public comment, the USPSTF's final recommendation statement now includes a brief summary of its contextual review of cost-effectiveness analyses, clarifications of the potential harms that were examined in its systematic review, and an opt-out provision. The recommendation statement also includes more information about HIV prevalence and incidence in different population subgroups, HIV screening tests, and potential long-term harms of ART.

The USPSTF considers 3 tools as the instruments of choice for screening for alcohol misuse in the primary care setting: the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), the abbreviated AUDIT-Consumption (AUDIT-C), and single-question screening (for example, the NIAAA recommends asking, &ldquo;How many times in the past year have you had 5 [for men] or 4 [for women and all adults older than 65 years] or more drinks in a day?&rdquo;).Of available screening tools, AUDIT is the most widely studied for detecting alcohol misuse in primary care settings; both AUDIT and the abbreviated AUDIT-C have good sensitivity and specificity for detecting the full spectrum of alcohol misuse across multiple populations. AUDIT comprises 10 questions and requires approximately 2 to 5 minutes to administer; AUDIT-C comprises 3 questions and takes 1 to 2 minutes to complete. Single-question screening also has adequate sensitivity and specificity across the alcohol-misuse spectrum and requires less than 1 minute to administer.
<h3>Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>
Behavioral counseling interventions for alcohol misuse vary in their specific components, administration, length, and number of interactions. They may include cognitive behavioral strategies, such as action plans, drinking diaries, stress management, or problem solving. Interventions may be delivered by face-to-face sessions, written self-help materials, computer- or Web-based programs, or telephone counseling. For the purposes of this recommendation statement, the USPSTF uses the following definitions of intervention intensity: very brief single contact (&le;5 minutes), brief single contact (6 to 15 minutes), brief multicontact (each contact is 6 to 15 minutes), and extended multicontact (&ge;1 contact, each &gt;15 minutes). Brief multicontact behavioral counseling seems to have the best evidence of effectiveness; very brief behavioral counseling has limited effect.The USPSTF found that counseling interventions in the primary care setting can positively affect unhealthy drinking behaviors in adults engaging in risky or hazardous drinking. Positive outcomes include reducing weekly alcohol consumption and long-term adherence to recommended drinking limits. Because brief behavioral counseling interventions decrease the proportion of persons who engage in episodes of heavy drinking (which results in high blood alcohol concentration [BAC]), indirect evidence supports the effect of screening and brief behavioral counseling interventions on important health outcomes, such as the probability of traumatic injury or death, especially that related to motor vehicles.Although screening detects persons along the entire spectrum of alcohol misuse, trials of behavioral counseling interventions in primary care settings largely focused on risky or hazardous drinking rather than alcohol abuse or dependence. Limited evidence suggests that brief behavioral counseling interventions are generally ineffective as singular treatments for alcohol abuse or dependence. The USPSTF did not formally evaluate other interventions (such as pharmacotherapy or outpatient treatment programs) for alcohol abuse or dependence, but the benefits of specialty treatment are well-established and recommended for persons meeting the diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence.
<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>
Evidence is lacking to determine the optimal interval for screening for alcohol misuse in adults.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
In deciding whether to screen adolescents for alcohol misuse and provide behavioral counseling interventions, primary care providers should consider the following factors.
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
In 2010, approximately 14% of adolescents in the 8th grade and 41% in the 12th grade reported using alcohol at least once within the past 30 days; 7% and 23%, respectively, reported consuming at least 5 or more drinks on a single occasion (an episode of heavy use) within the previous 2 weeks. Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for adolescents; according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, about 4% of 16-year-olds and 9% of 17-year-olds in 2009 drove under the influence of alcohol at least once during the previous year. Thirty-seven percent of traffic deaths among youth aged 16 to 20 years involve alcohol, and these deaths frequently involve alcohol-impaired drivers with lower BACs than other age groups.
<h4>Costs</h4>
Behavioral counseling interventions are associated with a time commitment ranging from 5 minutes to 2 hours, spread over multiple contacts. There are potential financial costs for parents and caregivers from lost work hours and travel to and from the provider.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
Potential harms associated with screening for alcohol misuse include anxiety, stigma or labeling, and interference with the clinician-patient relationship. Although evidence is very limited, no direct harms were identified for any population in available studies.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
Research suggests that although a majority of pediatricians and family practice clinicians report providing some alcohol prevention services to adolescent patients, they do not universally or consistently screen and counsel for alcohol misuse. Barriers include a perceived lack of time, familiarity with screening tools, training in managing positive results, and available treatment resources.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The AUDIT and AUDIT-C screening instruments for alcohol misuse are available from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration-Health Resources and Services Administration Center for Integrated Health Solutions (<a href=""http://www.integration.samhsa.gov/clinical-practice/screening-tools"">www.integration.samhsa.gov/clinical-practice/screening-tools</a>). Further details about the single-question screening method, as well as resources on primary care&ndash;feasible behavioral interventions, are available from the NIAAA (<a href=""http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/Practitioner/CliniciansGuide2005/guide.pdf"">http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/Practitioner/CliniciansGuide2005/guide.pdf</a>). <br /><br />The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends electronic screening and brief intervention to reduce excessive alcohol consumption. Electronic screening and brief intervention uses electronic devices (for example, computers, telephones, or mobile devices) to facilitate screening for excessive drinking and delivering a brief intervention that provides personalized feedback about the risks and consequences of excessive drinking. Delivery of personalized feedback can range from fully automated (computer-based) to interactive (provided by a person over the telephone). At least one part of the brief intervention must be delivered by an electronic device. Electronic screening and brief intervention can be delivered in various settings, such as health care systems, universities, or communities. The Community Preventive Services Task Force found limited information on the effectiveness of electronic screening and brief intervention among adolescents. The Community Preventive Services Task Force has also evaluated public health interventions (those that occur outside of the clinical practice setting) to prevent excessive alcohol consumption. It recommends instituting liability laws for establishments that sell or serve alcohol, increasing taxes on alcohol, maintaining limits on days and hours of the sale of alcohol, and regulating alcohol outlet density in communities as effective in preventing or reducing alcohol-related harms. It also recommends enhanced enforcement of laws prohibiting the sale of alcohol to minors. More information about the Community Preventive Services Task Force's recommendations on alcohol misuse is available at <a href=""http://www.thecommunityguide.org/alcohol/index.html"">www.thecommunityguide.org/alcohol/index.html</a>.<br /><br /> The Cochrane Collaboration has performed 2 systematic reviews to evaluate the effects of universal school- and family-based prevention programs to prevent or reduce alcohol misuse in young people. Although not entirely consistent across studies, evidence generally supported the effectiveness of certain school-based psychosocial and developmental programs, such as the Life Skills Training Program, the Unplugged Program, and the Good Behavior Game. Similarly, evidence generally supported small but positive effects from family-based interventions in preventing alcohol misuse in young people. The USPSTF has made recommendations on screening for and interventions to decrease the unhealthy use of other substances, including illicit drugs and tobacco.

<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Alcohol misuse among adolescents is an important public health problem. Limited evidence is available to assess the effects of screening and behavioral counseling in adolescents, and high-quality studies specifically addressing this population are needed. Although there is adequate evidence that brief behavioral counseling interventions improve several intermediate outcomes for persons engaging in risky or hazardous drinking, there is little direct evidence describing the ultimate effect of these interventions on longer-term morbidity, mortality, or quality of life. Most trials of behavioral counseling for screening-detected alcohol misuse focused on risky or hazardous alcohol use; future research is needed to help explain whether persons engaging in harmful drinking or alcohol abuse might benefit from behavioral counseling interventions in the primary care setting. Finally, detailed information about the relative comparative effectiveness of specific behavioral counseling components or approaches is largely lacking, as is focused guidance on how to individualize treatment decisions for a given subpopulation.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/alcmisuse/alcmisusefinalrs.htm#consider,127,"The American Society of Addiction Medicine recommends that primary care providers routinely screen for the presence of alcohol use problems in patients, screen for risk factors for development of alcohol dependence, and provide appropriate interventions. The NIAAA encourages primary care clinicians to incorporate alcohol screening and interventions into their practices and provides specific tools to implement these activities.  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that obstetrician&ndash;gynecologists have a key role in screening and providing brief intervention, patient education, and treatment referral for their patients who drink alcohol at risk levels. For pregnant women and those at risk for pregnancy, it is important that obstetrician&ndash;gynecologists give compelling and clear advice to avoid alcohol use or provide assistance for achieving abstinence or effective contraception to women who require help.  The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that clinicians screen all adolescent patients for alcohol use with a formal, validated screening tool, such as the Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, Trouble (CRAFFT) substance abuse screening test, at every health supervision visit and appropriate acute care visits and respond to screening results with the appropriate brief intervention.","Burden of Disease

	Alcohol misuse is a common issue across U.S. primary care populations; approximately 21% of adults report engaging in risky or hazardous drinking15, and the prevalence of current alcohol dependence is about 4%16. Alcohol misuse plays a contributing role in a wide range of health conditions, such as hypertension, gastritis, liver disease and cirrhosis, pancreatitis, certain types of cancer (for example, breast and esophageal), cognitive impairment, anxiety, and depression17. Alcohol misuse has also been implicated as a major factor in morbidity and mortality as a result of trauma, including falls, drownings, fires, motor vehicle crashes, homicide, and suicide18. Alcohol use in pregnancy is linked to a pattern of developmental abnormalities known as fetal alcohol syndrome, which occurs in about 0.2 to 1.5 per 1,000 live births in the United States19.

	Scope of Review

	The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review of randomized, controlled trials and nonrandomized trials with controls or comparators published between 1985 and 2011 on screening and behavioral counseling interventions for alcohol misuse in adults, adolescents, and pregnant women. The review also included individual systematic evidence reviews with or without meta-analyses done between 2006 and 2011. The following topics were examined: direct evidence of the effectiveness of screening for improving health outcomes, the accuracy of various screening approaches, the effectiveness of various behavioral counseling interventions for improving intermediate (such as rate of alcohol consumption or number of heavy drinking episodes) or long-term (such as alcohol-associated morbidity or mortality) health outcomes, the harms of screening and behavioral counseling interventions, and influences on the health care system that promote or detract from effective screening and counseling interventions for alcohol misuse.

	Accuracy of Screening Tests

	Numerous screening instruments can detect some or all of the drinking categories included in the spectrum of alcohol misuse. Tests include single-question screening; AUDIT; the Cut-Down, Annoyed, Guilty, and Eye-Opener (CAGE) questionnaire and related tests designed specifically for pregnant women, such as the Tolerance, Annoyed, Cut-Down, and Eye-Opener (T-ACE) and Tolerance, Worried, Eye-Openers, Amnesia, Kut-Down (TWEAK); the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test; the Rapid Alcohol Problems Screen; and the Alcohol-Related Problems Survey, among others. Several of these tests also have abbreviated versions.

	Five fair- to good-quality systematic reviews compared different screening test characteristics in primary care populations5, 6. Overall, the full AUDIT instrument, the abbreviated AUDIT-C, and single-question screening (asking, “How many times in the past year have you had 5 [for men] or 4 [for women and all adults older than 65 years] or more drinks in a day?”) have the best performance characteristics for detecting the full spectrum of alcohol misuse in adults, young adults, and pregnant women; therefore, the USPSTF prefers these screening approaches.

	AUDIT shows an optimal balance of sensitivity and specificity for detecting all forms of alcohol misuse when cutoff points of 4 or more (sensitivity, 84% to 85%; specificity, 77% to 84%) or 5 or more (sensitivity, 70% to 92%; specificity, 73% to 94%) are used; use of higher cutoff points increases specificity to an extent but reduces sensitivity. The sensitivity and specificity of AUDIT-C are best balanced at cutoff points of 4 or more (74% to 76% and 80% to 83%, respectively) and 3 or more (74% to 88% and 64% to 83%, respectively). Single-question screening has a reported sensitivity of 82% to 87% and specificity of 61% to 79%5, 6. However, the sensitivity of these screening tests varies by sex and achieving similar sensitivity for women requires a cutoff 1 point lower than that for men. Although the CAGE questionnaire has frequently been used in primary care settings as a low-burden screening tool for alcohol disorders, it has comparatively poor sensitivity for identifying risky or hazardous drinking, particularly among older adults (14% to 39%) and pregnant women (38% to 49%)5.

	None of the identified systematic reviews provided information about the use of screening tests in adolescents.

	Effectiveness of Screening and Behavioral Counseling Interventions

	None of the published studies directly evaluated the effect of screening and consequent behavioral counseling interventions for alcohol misuse compared with no screening on alcohol-related morbidity or mortality in any population. However, the USPSTF did find adequate evidence that brief counseling interventions in adults with screening-detected risky or hazardous drinking positively affect several unhealthy drinking behaviors, including heavy episodic (binge) drinking, high average weekly intake of alcohol, and consumption above recommended intake limits.

	Twenty-three randomized, controlled trials (11 of which were performed in the United States) compared the effects of behavioral counseling interventions with usual care in adults with screening-detected alcohol misuse. Most interventions evaluated were either brief or brief multicontact behavioral counseling interventions that were directly provided by primary care physicians. The mean age of participants was generally between 30 and 50 years5, 6.

	Studies show that behavioral counseling interventions reduce binge drinking. “Binge drinking” is heavy per-occasion alcohol use; the NIAAA defines it as a pattern of drinking that results in a BAC of 0.08% or higher, generally when men consume 5 or more drinks and women consume 4 or more drinks on 1 occasion within about 2 hours20. Meta-analysis from 7 trials showed that behavioral counseling interventions resulted in a 12% absolute increase in the proportion of adult participants with screening-detected risky or hazardous drinking who reported no heavy drinking episodes after 1 year compared with the control group (95% CI, 7% to 16%). Subgroup analyses suggest that single-contact interventions may be less effective or ineffective compared with multicontact approaches5, 6.

	In younger adults (such as college age), 3 trials provided evidence that behavioral counseling interventions reduced the frequency of heavy drinking episodes by about 1 day per month (average baseline, 6 to 7 heavy drinking days per month) at 6 months of follow-up21-23. The evidence was insufficient to evaluate whether there are relative differences in the effect for older adults (aged 65 years or older).

	Behavioral counseling interventions also reduce the total number of drinks per week consumed by adults with screening-detected risky or hazardous drinking. A standard drink is defined as 12.0 oz of beer, 5.0 oz of wine, or 1.5 oz of liquor. Meta-analysis of 10 trials reporting on this outcome showed that adults receiving behavioral counseling interventions reduced their average weekly consumption of alcohol from a baseline of 23 drinks to approximately 19 drinks per week at 12 months of follow-up compared with the control group (absolute difference, 3.6 fewer drinks per week [95% CI, 2.4 to 4.8])5, 6. Among younger adults, data from 3 trials conducted in the United States showed that average consumption decreased from a baseline of about 15 drinks to 13 drinks per week at 6 months of follow-up21-23. Two studies provided information about the effect of behavioral counseling on weekly alcohol consumption rates in older adults; pooled analysis showed that consumption decreased from an average of about 16 drinks to about 14 drinks per week at 12 months of follow-up24, 25.

	On the basis of a meta-analysis of 9 relevant trials, the absolute proportion of adults with screening-detected risky or hazardous drinking who reported not exceeding recommended drinking limits over 12 months increased by 11% (95% CI, 8% to 13%) in participants receiving behavioral counseling interventions compared with the control group5, 6. The definition and rationale of a given recommended limit of alcohol consumption may vary to some degree across guidelines, making this outcome slightly more subjective than the others evaluated by the USPSTF.

	A commonly cited standard developed by the NIAAA recommends that healthy adult men aged 65 years or younger have no more than 4 drinks per day and no more than 14 drinks per week and healthy adult women and all adults older than 65 years have no more than 3 drinks per day and no more than 7 drinks per week. The NIAAA also recommends lower levels of consumption or abstinence for adults who receive medications that interact with alcohol, have a health condition exacerbated by alcohol, or are pregnant26. For older adults (aged 65 years or older), 2 studies showed an absolute increase of 9% (95% CI, 2% to 16%) in the proportion of risky or hazardous drinkers who adhered to recommended drinking limits after behavioral counseling at 1 year of follow-up24, 25. There was not enough evidence to assess whether there are relative differences in the effect for younger adults.

	A single study meeting inclusion criteria was identified for pregnant women. In this trial, 250 pregnant women with a gestational age of 28 weeks or less were randomly assigned to comprehensive assessment only or assessment and a 45-minute behavioral counseling intervention. The study found a sustained reduction in the daily consumption of alcohol in both groups (with no significant difference between them); it also found that women who abstained from alcohol at baseline in the behavioral intervention group were more likely to do so than women in the control group (86% vs. 72%; P = 0.04)27. Only 1 study meeting inclusion criteria included women who were breastfeeding28, and they made up less than 30% of the total population. However, as previously described, multiple studies in the general adult population showed that behavioral counseling interventions reduce alcohol consumption and increase adherence to recommended drinking limits among women of childbearing age.

	No studies meeting inclusion criteria were identified for the effects of brief behavioral counseling interventions on screening-detected alcohol misuse in adolescents.

	Few studies of behavioral counseling interventions for alcohol misuse have rigorously examined longer-term health outcomes, such as alcohol-related morbidity or mortality. Meta-analysis of 6 studies did not find a significant effect of behavioral counseling interventions on all-cause mortality (rate ratio, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.22 to 1.2]), although findings generally trended favorably for the intervention groups. However, because none of the studies were designed or powered to detect a difference in mortality, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the true effect5, 6. A sizable body of observational evidence does show a link between increasing alcohol consumption levels and risk for traumatic injury or death.

	A 2010 systematic review and meta-analysis of case–control and case-crossover studies evaluating the association between level of acute alcohol consumption and probability of an injury related to a motor vehicle crash found a rapidly increasing dose–response relationship between the 2 variables. For the consumption of 24 g of alcohol (or about 2 standard drinks) within a 6-hour period, the odds ratio of being injured in a motor vehicle crash is 2.20 compared with no alcohol intake; at 4 to 5 drinks consumed (a rough proxy for the NIAAA definition of a heavy drinking episode), the odds ratio is about 5.00 to 10.00, and after 10 drinks, the odds ratio is 52.0029. A review of case–control roadside surveys evaluating the relationship between BAC in drivers involved in motor vehicle crashes compared with those not involved in incidents found that the relative probability of a motor vehicle crash resulting in injury or death increased sharply after attainment of a BAC of about 0.08% (relative risk ranged from about 2 to 4 at a BAC of 0.08% compared with a BAC of 0.00%, with sharper increases at higher BACs)30.

	Screening for alcohol misuse will detect persons engaging in a spectrum of unhealthy drinking behaviors, not just risky or hazardous drinking. However, most available studies of behavioral counseling interventions focused on risky or hazardous drinking and either specifically excluded persons with alcohol dependence or used enrollment criteria that necessarily restricted participation by such persons. The limited evidence available for persons with alcohol dependence suggests that brief behavioral counseling interventions may be ineffective in this population5, 6. The effectiveness of behavioral counseling in primary care settings for persons engaging in harmful alcohol use or alcohol abuse is uncertain.

	Although the USPSTF did not formally assess the evidence on interventions for alcohol dependence, a range of treatment options with established efficacy exists, including 12-step programs (such as Alcoholics Anonymous), intensive outpatient or inpatient treatment programs, and pharmacotherapy. However, the relative effectiveness of the various treatment approaches has not been systematically examined in randomized trials and the USPSTF was unable to identify any trials of pharmacotherapy in the primary care setting.

	Potential Harms of Screening and Behavioral Counseling

	Very limited evidence is available on the harms of screening and behavioral counseling for alcohol misuse. Possible harms include anxiety, labeling, discrimination, or interference with the doctor–patient relationship. An additional effect might be a consequent increase in smoking or illicit substance use, if persons receiving screening or behavioral counseling interventions for risky drinking replace 1 harmful substance with another.

	No studies directly evaluated the harms of screening; few studies reported information about harms resulting from behavioral counseling interventions. Two studies found no changes in anxiety levels among adults with screening-detected alcohol misuse receiving behavioral counseling, and 5 studies qualitatively described that cigarette consumption seemed unchanged among adults receiving counseling interventions5, 6. No specific information was available for the adolescent population. No direct evidence of harm from screening or behavioral counseling for alcohol misuse was identified in any study; given the noninvasive nature of these practices, the adverse effects are likely to be small to none.

	Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit

	Adequate evidence supports a moderate beneficial effect of screening for alcohol misuse followed by brief behavioral counseling interventions in adults engaged in risky or hazardous drinking. Unhealthy drinking behaviors in this population, including heavy episodic drinking, high daily or weekly levels of alcohol consumption, and exceeding recommended drinking limits, can all be reduced through screening and behavioral counseling in the primary care setting. Although limited specific evidence for pregnant women was found, the USPSTF determined that available studies of behavioral counseling interventions for alcohol misuse in the general adult population apply to pregnant adult women.

	Available studies have not focused on the effect of screening and behavioral counseling on longer-term health outcomes, such as alcohol-related disease or death. However, epidemiologic evidence supports an association between increasing alcohol consumption and increased risk for morbidity and mortality related to a motor vehicle crash, providing indirect support that counseling interventions—which reduce acute and sustained alcohol intake levels—can help improve some health outcomes in alcohol misuse29, 30. A large body of observational evidence also links alcohol use in pregnant women with an increased risk for subsequent birth defects31, 32.

	Given the noninvasive nature of screening and counseling interventions for alcohol misuse, the USPSTF assessed the range of probable harms to be small to none. Therefore, given moderate benefit and little to no associated harm, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of screening adults, including younger adults, for alcohol misuse and providing brief behavioral counseling interventions for those engaged in risky or hazardous drinking is moderate.

	No studies were identified that addressed screening and behavioral counseling interventions for alcohol misuse in adolescents. As such, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening and behavioral counseling for alcohol misuse in this population.

	Response to Public Comments

	A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted on the USPSTF Web site from 24 September 2012 to 22 October 2012. Several comments indicated that the USPSTF should more clearly emphasize the need for more research on screening and counseling interventions for alcohol misuse in the adolescent population; this was added to the Research Needs and Gaps section. Some comments requested the inclusion of recommended screening instruments; links to these tools were added to the Useful Resources section. Several comments indicated that there was insufficient explanation of the distinctions between risky drinking and alcohol dependence, as well as what constitutes “binge” drinking or a “drink”; expanded definitions and examples were added to the Rationale and Discussion sections.",,Screening and Behavioral Counseling Interventions in Primary Care to Reduce Alcohol Misuse,"Alcohol Misuse, Screening and Behavioral Counseling Interventions in Primary Care, 2013"
"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to children in the general U.S. population from newborn to age 18 years who do not have signs or symptoms of maltreatment. &ldquo;Child maltreatment&rdquo; is defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a parent or other caregiver that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child. ""Child abuse&rdquo; (acts of commission) includes physical, sexual, and psychological abuse. &ldquo;Child neglect&rdquo; (acts of omission) includes the failure to provide for a child's basic physical, emotional, health care, or educational needs or to protect a child from harm or potential harm.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
Numerous risk factors are associated with child maltreatment, including but not limited to young, single, or nonbiological parents; parental lack of understanding of children's needs, child development, or parenting skills; poor parent&ndash;child relationships or negative interactions; parental thoughts or emotions that support maltreatment behaviors; family dysfunction or violence; parental history of abuse or neglect in the family of origin; substance abuse within the family; social isolation, poverty, or other socioeconomic disadvantages; and parental stress and distress.
<h3>Interventions</h3>
Although the evidence is insufficient to recommend specific preventive interventions in a clinical setting, most programs for prevention of child maltreatment studied and recommended by others focus on home visitation, which is generally considered to be a community-based service. Home visitation programs usually comprise a combination of services provided by a nurse or paraprofessional in a family's home on a regularly scheduled basis. Most home visitation programs are targeted to families with young children and often begin in the pre- or postnatal period.The services provided in home visitation programs often include parent education on normal child development, counseling, problem solving, free transportation to health clinic appointments, enhancement of informal support systems, linkage to community services, promotion of positive parent&ndash;child interactions, ensuring a source for regular health care, promotion of environmental safety, and classes for preparing for motherhood. The one trial reviewed by the USPSTF that was not a home visitation program used a multistep approach in a primary care clinic, with a social worker available to help parents who self-reported psychosocial problems, such as substance abuse.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
Child maltreatment is a serious problem that affected more than 680,000 children and resulted in 1,570 deaths in 2011. It can result in lifelong negative consequences for victims. Most child maltreatment is in the form of neglect (approximately 78%), and most deaths occur in children younger than 4 years (approximately 80%).
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
There is limited evidence on harms of interventions to prevent child maltreatment. Reported potential harms include dissolution of families, legal concerns, and an increased risk for further harm to the child.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
All states and the District of Columbia have laws that mandate that all professionals who have contact with children, including all health care workers, report suspected maltreatment to Child Protective Services (CPS). Pediatricians, family physicians, and other primary care providers are in a unique position to identify children at risk of maltreatment through well-child and other visits. However, although pediatricians state that preventing maltreatment is one of their primary roles, they rarely explicitly screen for family violence in practice or screen only in selected cases. All states have home visiting programs to support families with young children, but the services provided in these programs and the eligibility criteria vary by state.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The USPSTF has published a new recommendation on screening for intimate partner violence and abuse of elderly and vulnerable adults (available at <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org)</a>. The Community Preventive Services Task has issued a recommendation on early childhood home visitation to prevent child maltreatment (available at <a href=""http://www.thecommunityguide.org/violence/home/index.html"">http://www.thecommunityguide.org/violence/home/index.html</a>).
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
The USPSTF recognizes the importance of this serious health problem and that research in numerous areas related to reducing child maltreatment should be a priority. The relationship between harsh punishment (such as spanking) and abuse needs to be further explored, as does that between intimate partner violence and child maltreatment. Additional research is also needed to determine effective methods for physicians and other health care clinicians to identify children at risk for or currently experiencing maltreatment. The lack of studies on the prevention of maltreatment of older children, which was identified in the USPSTF's previous recommendation as an important evidence gap, has yet to be addressed. Research is also needed to confirm the efficacy and expand the applicability of the observed benefits reported in some of the intervention studies reviewed by the USPSTF.  Standardization of interventions and outcomes would strengthen the evidence and allow quantitative meta-analysis. Research is also needed to determine whether there are unintended harms from screening, risk assessment, and interventions. In all areas related to child maltreatment, more data are needed on how best to measure outcomes related to child abuse and neglect.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/childabuse/childmaltreatfinalrs.htm#consider,128,"In 2010, the American Academy of Pediatrics published a clinical report advocating for a prominent role of pediatricians in prevention of maltreatment and provided specific guidelines and information on risk factors and protective factors. The American Medical Association recommends routine inquiry about child abuse or neglect. The American Academy of Family Physicians recently concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of primary care interventions to prevent child maltreatment. Other organizations do not specifically recommend universal screening but recommend that pediatricians and family practice clinicians remain alert for indications of maltreatment&nbsp;or recommend screening in pediatric offices for intimate partner and family violence.  The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care issued several recommendations related to child maltreatment in 2000 and recommended against screening for persons at risk for experiencing or committing child maltreatment (D recommendation). However, it recommended home visitation for disadvantaged families from the prenatal period through infancy but found no good evidence to include or exclude a referral for a comprehensive health care program; a parent education and support program; or a combined service program that includes case management, education, and psychotherapy for the prevention of child maltreatment. &ldquo;Disadvantaged families&rdquo; are defined as first-time mothers with one or more of the following characteristics: age younger than 19 years, single-parent status, and low socioeconomic status. The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends early childhood home visitation interventions to prevent child maltreatment.","Burden of Disease

	In 2011, approximately 680,000 children were victims of maltreatment1. Approximately 78% of these children experienced neglect, 18% physical abuse, and 9% sexual abuse; many experienced more than one type of maltreatment. In addition, 10.3% were victims of other types of maltreatment, including threatened abuse, parental drug or alcohol abuse, and lack of supervision. An estimated 1,570 children died of maltreatment in 2011 (2.1 per 100,000 children)1.

	Rates of maltreatment are similar for boys and girls, but younger children are much more likely to be victims. In 2011, nearly half (47%) of all victims were 5 years or younger, and children younger than 1 year had the highest rate of victimization at 21.2 per 1,000 children1. This age group also experienced the highest fatality rates; in 2011, 81.6% of children who died of maltreatment were younger than 4 years and many (42.4%) were younger than 1 year1.

	Although the definition of child maltreatment varies by state8, there are minimum standards under federal law (42 USCA §5106g), which defines child abuse and neglect as “any recent act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation; or an act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm”1, 9, 10.

	For victims who survive childhood, many well-documented, long-term medical and psychological problems are associated with a history of maltreatment. Possible long-term psychiatric effects include psychosis, personality disorders, and substance abuse11-19. In addition, victims of child maltreatment more commonly have physical health abnormalities, from chronic pain20, 21 and disabilities22 to diabetes and autoimmune disorders23, 24.

	Risk Factors

	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention25 and recent studies report the following risk factors for child maltreatment: parental lack of understanding of children's needs, child development, and parenting; parental history of maltreatment from family of origin26; substance abuse in the family; young, single27, or nonbiological parents; parental thoughts and emotions that are supportive of maltreatment behaviors; and parental stress and distress, including depression or other mental health disorders. Family risk factors include social isolation26; poverty28, 29 and other socioeconomic disadvantages 26; intimate partner violence; and poor parent-child relationships and negative interactions. Child-specific risk factors include being younger than 4 years, having physical1, 26, 27 or intellectual disabilities, and being born at medical risk, such as being preterm, born with addiction, or hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit30.

	Scope of Review

	In updating its 2004 recommendation31, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review3 on interventions to prevent child maltreatment for children at risk. This update focuses on new studies and evidence gaps that were unresolved at the time of the 2004 recommendation. Beneficial outcomes considered include reduced exposure to maltreatment (primarily measured by CPS reports) and reduced harms to physical or mental health or mortality. Although the original scope of the review focused on screening and interventions, the USPSTF changed the scope to focus on preventive interventions (that are implemented in or can be referred by providers in the primary care setting) rather than screening.

	Effectiveness of Preventive Interventions

	The USPSTF reviewed studies of asymptomatic children who received primary care–accessible interventions to prevent child maltreatment. The main outcomes that the USPSTF considered were mortality, substantiated CPS reports, and removal from the home. The USPSTF found one fair-quality study of an intervention provided in a clinical setting and 10 fair-quality studies of home visitation programs to prevent child maltreatment. The trial implemented in a clinical setting evaluated the Safe Environment for Every Kid model, which includes risk assessment, physician training, resources for parents and physicians, and social work services for families desiring them32. This trial enrolled 729 parents of children who were newborn to age 5 years and assessed risk by using the Parent Screening Questionnaire, a 20-item self-report of common psychosocial problems. Results indicated significantly reduced CPS reports (13% vs. 19%; P = 0.03) among children randomly assigned to the intervention group compared with usual care up to 44 months after the intervention. This study had limitations, including more than 20% loss to attrition, not enough information to determine whether the trial maintained comparable groups throughout the study, and lack of intention-to-treat analysis.

	Ten new trials of home visitation in early childhood have been published since the previous USPSTF recommendation. Most trials enrolled patients on the basis of risk factors for child abuse and neglect, including inadequate prenatal care; young age of parents; limited finances, education, and social support; or a history of substance abuse. All of the trials had some methodological limitations leading to an assessment as fair quality; these limitations include inadequate inclusion and exclusion criteria, inadequate randomization or allocation concealment, inadequate blinding, low adherence to the intervention, high loss to follow-up (>20%), dissimilar groups at baseline or follow-up, and lack of intention-to-treat analysis3.

	Home visits were provided by trained paraprofessionals or nurses and began before or soon after birth and continued for 3 to 36 months. One trial reported mortality; this study included 743 children with 9 years of follow-up. Children receiving home visits by a nurse as infants were less likely to die by age 9 years than those in the usual care control group, although results were not significant (1 vs. 10 deaths; P = 0.080). In this study, the one death in the home visit group was the result of chromosomal abnormalities, whereas the 10 deaths in the control group were from complications of prematurity (n = 3), sudden infant death syndrome (n = 3), injury (n = 3 [homicide assault by firearm, accidental injury from firearm, and motor vehicle accident]), and intestinal infection (n = 1).

	Six of the home visitation trials published since the last USPSTF review used CPS reports as an outcome33-38. No trials reported differences in rates of CPS reports between home visit and control groups during the period of home visitation33-38. However, one trial found that children visited by a professional clinical team had decreased CPS involvement at 3 years after enrollment (odds ratio for effect of the intervention, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.0 to 4.4])38.

	The previous USPSTF review found inconsistent effects on CPS reports in three included studies. In one trial with 15 years of follow-up39, results of a subgroup analysis at 2 years found that poor, high-risk teenage mothers who were visited by nurses were less likely to commit acts of confirmed child abuse and neglect than those who did not receive such visits (4% vs. 19%; P = 0.07). However, there were no differences for the entire sample, and results at 3 and 4 years showed no differences40.

	After 15 years of followup, children in the home visit group were less likely to be involved in substantiated CPS reports (incidence rate, 0.44 vs. 0.73; P = 0.04)41. Mothers who received home visits were less likely to be a substantiated perpetrator of child abuse (incidence rate, 0.32 vs. 0.65; P = 0.01) toward the child being studied or another child over the same 15-year period. Two other trials of visits by paraprofessionals found no differences in total CPS reports after either 142 or 343 years of followup.

	Two recent trials reported removal of the child from the home33, 34 and did not report a difference between the intervention and control groups over 18 (6% vs. 0%; P = not reported)33 or 36 months of followup (1.8% vs. 0.8%; P = not reported)34.

	Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit

	The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of interventions delivered in primary care to prevent child maltreatment. The level of certainty of the magnitude of the benefits and harms of these interventions is low.

	Response to Public Comments

	A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 22 January to 18 February 2013. Several comments agreed with the draft recommendation; several other comments noted the limitations of using CPS reports as a measure of child maltreatment. The USPSTF recognizes the limitations of the evidence on child maltreatment measures and outcomes and added this to the Research Needs and Gaps section. A few comments expressed confusion over the meaning of “primary care–referable”; this was clarified in the statement. One comment requested clarification of the description of the Safe Environment for Every Kid model study, which was added to the Discussion section.",,Primary Care Interventions to Prevent Child Maltreatment,"Child Maltreatment, Primary Care Interventions, 2013"
"<b>Patient Population </b><br>
This recommendation applies to the general adult population, including adults with diabetes. The USPSTF did not review evidence for screening certain groups at high risk for severe urinary tract infections, such as transplant recipients, patients with sickle cell disease, and patients with recurrent urinary tract infections.<br><br>

<b>Screening Tests </b><br>
The screening tests used commonly in the primary care setting (dipstick analysis and direct microscopy) have poor positive and negative predictive value for detecting bacteriuria in asymptomatic persons. Urine culture is the gold standard for detecting asymptomatic bacteriuria but is expensive for routine screening in populations with a low prevalence of the condition. However, no currently available tests have a high enough sensitivity and negative predictive value in pregnant women to replace the urine culture as the preferred screening test.<br><br>

<b>Treatment</b><br>
Pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria should receive antibiotic therapy directed at the cultured organism and follow-up monitoring.<br><br>

<b>Screening Intervals </b><br>
All pregnant women should provide a clean-catch urine specimen for a screening culture at 12 to 16 weeks' gestation or at the first prenatal visit, if later. The optimal frequency of subsequent urine testing during pregnancy is uncertain.<br>",www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf08/asymptbact/asbactrs.htm#clinical,90,"<b>Recommendations of Others</b><br>
The American Academy of Family Physicians strongly recommends that all pregnant women be screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria using urine culture at 12 to 16 weeks' gestation or at the first prenatal visit if after that time.<br><br> 

The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends screening pregnant women for asymptomatic bacteriuria with a urine culture ""at least once"" in early pregnancy. It also states that screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant women, diabetic women, or community-dwelling or institutionalized older persons is not indicated.<br><br>

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria ""early in pregnancy, as appropriate"".<br><br>

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant women with diabetes mellitus.

",www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf08/asymptbact/asbactrs.htm#recommendations,"<br><b>Importance:</b> In pregnant women, asymptomatic bacteriuria has been associated with an increased incidence of pyelonephritis and low birthweight (birthweight <2500 g).<br><br>

<b>Detection:</b> Asymptomatic bacteriuria can be reliably detected through urine culture. The presence of at least 105 colony-forming units per mL of urine, of a single uropathogen, and in a midstream clean-catch specimen is considered a positive test result.<br><br>

<b>Benefits of Detection and Early Intervention:</b> In pregnant women, convincing evidence indicates that detection of and treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria with antibiotics significantly reduces the incidence of symptomatic maternal urinary tract infections and low birthweight.<br><br>

In men and nonpregnant women, adequate evidence suggests that screening men and nonpregnant women for asymptomatic bacteriuria is ineffective in improving clinical outcomes.<br><br>

<b>Harms of Detection and Early Treatment:</b> Potential harms associated with treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria include adverse effects from antibiotics and development of bacterial resistance. Without evidence of benefits from screening men and nonpregnant women, the potential harms associated with overuse of antibiotics are especially significant.<br><br>

<b>USPSTF Assessment:</b> The USPSTF concludes that 1) in pregnant women, there is high certainty that the net benefit of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria is substantial, and 2) in men and nonpregnant women, there is moderate certainty that the harms of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria outweigh the benefits.",Asymptomatic Bacteriuria,"Asymptomatic Bacteriuria, Screening, 2008 "
"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults 50 years and older who are at average risk of colorectal cancer and who do not have a family history of known genetic disorders that predispose them to a high lifetime risk of colorectal cancer (such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis), a personal history of inflammatory bowel disease, a previous adenomatous polyp, or previous colorectal cancer.<br /><br />When screening results in the diagnosis of colorectal adenomas or cancer, patients are followed up with a surveillance regimen, and recommendations for screening no longer apply. The USPSTF did not review or consider the evidence on the effectiveness of any particular surveillance regimen after diagnosis and removal of adenomatous polyps or colorectal cancer.</p>
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
<p>For the vast majority of adults, the most important risk factor for colorectal cancer is older age. Most cases of colorectal cancer occur among adults older than 50 years; the median age at diagnosis is 68 years.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation3"">3</a><br /><br />A positive family history (excluding known inherited familial syndromes) is thought to be linked to about 20% of cases of colorectal cancer.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;About 3% to 10% of the population has a first-degree relative with colorectal cancer.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation7"">7</a>&nbsp;The USPSTF did not specifically review the evidence on screening in populations at increased risk; however, other professional organizations recommend that patients with a family history of colorectal cancer (a first-degree relative with early-onset colorectal cancer or multiple first-degree relatives with the disease) be screened more frequently starting at a younger age, and with colonoscopy.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation8"">8</a><br /><br />Male sex and black race are also associated with higher colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. Black adults have the highest incidence and mortality rates compared with other racial/ethnic subgroups.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation3"">3</a>&nbsp;The reasons for these disparities are not entirely clear. Studies have documented inequalities in screening, diagnostic follow-up, and treatment; they also suggest that equal treatment generally seems to produce equal outcomes.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation9"">9-11</a>&nbsp;Accordingly, this recommendation applies to all racial/ethnic groups, with the clear acknowledgement that efforts are needed to ensure that at-risk populations receive recommended screening, follow-up, and treatment.</p>
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#tab"">Table</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>lists the various screening tests for colorectal cancer and notes potential frequency of use as well as additional considerations for each method. The&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#fig"">Figure</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>presents the estimated number of life-years gained, colorectal cancer deaths averted, lifetime colonoscopies required, and resulting complications per 1,000 screened adults aged 50 to 75 years for each of the screening strategies. These estimates are derived from modeling conducted by the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) to inform this recommendation.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2"">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation12"">12</a></p>
<h4>Stool-Based Tests</h4>
<p>Multiple randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have shown that screening with the guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) reduces colorectal cancer deaths.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;Fecal immunochemical tests (FITs), which identify intact human hemoglobin in stool, have improved sensitivity compared with gFOBT for detecting colorectal cancer.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;Among the FITs that are cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and available for use in the United States, the OC FIT-CHEK family of FITs (Polymedco)&mdash;which include the OC-Light and the OC-Auto&mdash;have the best test performance characteristics (ie, highest sensitivity and specificity).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;Multitargeted stool DNA testing (FIT-DNA) is an emerging screening strategy that combines a FIT with testing for altered DNA biomarkers in cells shed into the stool. Multitargeted stool DNA testing has increased single-test sensitivity for detecting colorectal cancer compared with FIT alone.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation13"">13</a>&nbsp;The harms of stool-based testing primarily result from adverse events associated with follow-up colonoscopy of positive findings.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;The specificity of FIT-DNA is lower than that of FIT alone,<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation13"">13</a>&nbsp;which means it has a higher number of false-positive results and higher likelihood of follow-up colonoscopy and experiencing an associated adverse event per screening test. There are no empirical data on the appropriate longitudinal follow-up for an abnormal FIT-DNA test result followed by a negative colonoscopy; there is potential for overly intensive surveillance due to clinician and patient concerns about the implications of the genetic component of the test.</p>
<h4>Direct Visualization Tests</h4>
<p>Several RCTs have shown that flexible sigmoidoscopy alone reduces deaths from colorectal cancer.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;Flexible sigmoidoscopy combined with FIT has been studied in a single trial and was found to reduce the colorectal cancer&ndash;specific mortality rate more than flexible sigmoidoscopy alone.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation14"">14</a>&nbsp;Modeling studies conducted by CISNET also consistently estimate that combined testing yields more life-years gained and colorectal cancer deaths averted compared with flexible sigmoidoscopy alone.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2"">2</a>&nbsp;Flexible sigmoidoscopy can result in direct harms, such as colonic perforations and bleeding, although the associated event rates are much lower than those observed with colonoscopy.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;Harms can also occur as a result of follow-up colonoscopy.<br /><br />Completed trials of flexible sigmoidoscopy provide indirect evidence that colonoscopy&mdash;a similar endoscopic screening method&mdash;reduces colorectal cancer mortality. A prospective cohort study also found an association between patients who self-reported being screened with colonoscopy and a lower colorectal cancer mortality rate.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation15"">15</a>&nbsp;Colonoscopy has both indirect and direct harms. Harms may be caused by bowel preparation prior to the procedure (eg, dehydration and electrolyte imbalances), the sedation used during the procedure (eg, cardiovascular events), or the procedure itself (eg, infection, colonic perforations, or bleeding).<br /><br />Evidence for assessing the effectiveness of computed tomography (CT) colonography is limited to studies of its test characteristics.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>Computed tomography colonography can result in unnecessary diagnostic testing or treatment of incidental extracolonic findings that are of no importance or would never have threatened the patient&rsquo;s health or become apparent without screening (ie, overdiagnosis and overtreatment).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;Extracolonic findings are common, occurring in about 40% to 70% of screening examinations. Between 5% and 37% of these findings result in diagnostic follow-up, and about 3% require definitive treatment.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;As with other screening strategies, indirect harms from CT colonography can also occur from follow-up colonoscopy for positive findings.</p>
<h4>Serology Tests</h4>
<p>The FDA approved a blood test to detect circulating methylated&nbsp;<em>SEPT9</em>&nbsp;DNA (Epi proColon; Epigenomics) in April 2016.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation16"">16</a>&nbsp;A single test characteristic study met the inclusion criteria for the systematic evidence review supporting this recommendation statement; it found the&nbsp;<em>SEPT9&nbsp;</em>DNA test to have low sensitivity (48%) for detecting colorectal cancer.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation17"">17</a></p>
<h3>Starting and Stopping Ages</h3>
<p>Available RCTs of gFOBT and flexible sigmoidoscopy included patients with age ranges of 45 to 80 years and 50 to 74 years, respectively. For gFOBT, the majority of participants entered the trials at age 50 or 60 years; for flexible sigmoidoscopy, the mean age of participants was 56 to 60 years.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a><br /><br />Microsimulation analyses performed by CISNET suggest that starting colorectal cancer screening at age 45 years rather than 50 years is estimated to yield a modest increase in life-years gained and a more efficient balance between life-years gained and lifetime number of colonoscopies (a proxy measure for the burden of screening).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2"">2</a>&nbsp;However, across the different screening methods, lowering the age at which to begin screening to 45 years while maintaining the same screening interval resulted in an estimated increase in the lifetime number of colonoscopies. In the case of screening colonoscopy, 2 of the 3 models found that by starting screening at age 45 years, the screening interval could be extended from 10 to 15 years. Doing so maintained the same (or slightly more) life-years gained as performing colonoscopy every 10 years starting at age 50 years without increasing the lifetime number of colonoscopies. However, 1 model estimated a slight loss in life-years gained with a longer screening interval and an earlier age at which to begin screening.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2"">2</a><br /><br />The USPSTF considered these findings and concluded that the evidence best supports a starting age of 50 years for the general population, noting the modest increase in life-years gained by starting screening earlier, the discordant findings across models for extending the screening interval when the age at which to begin screening is lowered, and the lack of empirical evidence in younger populations.<br /><br />The age at which the balance of benefits and harms of colorectal cancer screening becomes less favorable varies based on a patient&rsquo;s life expectancy, health status, comorbid conditions, and prior screening status.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation18"">18</a>&nbsp;Empirical data from randomized trials on outcomes of screening after age 74 years are scarce. All 3 CISNET models consistently estimate that few additional life-years are gained when screening is extended past age 75 years among average-risk adults who have previously received adequate screening.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2"">2</a><br /><br />The USPSTF does not recommend routine screening for colorectal cancer in adults 86 years and older. In this age group, competing causes of mortality preclude a mortality benefit that would outweigh the harms.</p>
<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>
<p>Evidence from RCTs demonstrates that annual or biennial screening with gFOBT as well as 1-time and every 3- to 5-year flexible sigmoidoscopy reduces colorectal cancer deaths.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;The CISNET models found that several screening strategies were estimated to yield comparable life-years gained (ie, life-years gained with the noncolonoscopy strategies were within 90% of those gained with the colonoscopy strategy) among adults aged 50 to 75 years and an efficient balance of benefits and harms (see the full CISNET report for more details<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2"">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation12"">12</a>). These screening strategies include 1) annual screening with FIT, 2) screening every 10 years with flexible sigmoidoscopy and annual screening with FIT, 3) screening every 10 years with colonoscopy, and 4) screening every 5 years with CT colonography. The findings for CT colonography depend on the proxy measure used for the burden of screening (number of lifetime colonoscopies or lifetime cathartic bowel preparations). Two of the 3 CISNET models found that FIT-DNA screening every 3 years (as recommended by the manufacturer) was estimated to yield life-years gained less than 90% of the colonoscopy screening strategy (84% and 87%, respectively). Another way to conceptualize these findings is to note that CISNET modeling found that FIT-DNA screening every 3 years was estimated to provide about the same amount of benefit as screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy alone every 5 years (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#fig"">Figure</a>).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2"">2</a></p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Treatment of early-stage colorectal cancer generally consists of local excision or simple polypectomy for tumors limited to the colonic mucosa or surgical resection (via laparoscopy or open approach) with anastomosis for larger, localized lesions.</p>
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
<p>The USPSTF has made a recommendation on aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer in average-risk adults (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).</p>",,166,"<h3><em><strong>Other Considerations</strong></em></h3>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Colorectal cancer causes substantial morbidity and mortality, and the evidence is convincing that screening for colorectal cancer reduces that burden. Despite the availability of several effective screening options, nearly one-third of eligible adults have never been screened.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation19"">19</a>&nbsp;Different screening methods may be more or less attractive for patients based on their features. For example, colonoscopy requires a relatively greater time commitment over a short period (bowel preparation, procedure, and recovery) but allows for much longer time between screenings compared with stool-based screening. Stool-based screening requires persons to handle their feces, which may be difficult for some, but the test is quick and noninvasive and can be done at home (the sample is mailed to the laboratory for testing). Flexible sigmoidoscopy combined with annual FIT may be an attractive option for persons who want reassurance from endoscopic screening but want to limit their exposure to colonoscopy. Given the lack of evidence from head-to-head comparative trials that any of the screening strategies have a greater net benefit than the others, clinicians should consider engaging patients in informed decision making about the screening strategy that would most likely result in completion, with high adherence over time, taking into consideration both the patient&rsquo;s preferences and local availability.For colorectal cancer screening programs to be successful in reducing mortality, they need to involve more than just the screening method in isolation. Screening is a cascade of activities that must occur in concert, cohesively, and in an organized way for benefits to be realized, from the point of the initial screening examination (including related interventions or services that are required for successful administration of the screening test, such as bowel preparation or sedation with endoscopy) to the timely receipt of any necessary diagnostic follow-up and treatment.Multiple effective implementation strategies have been demonstrated to increase appropriate provision and use of colorectal cancer screening. Specifically, the Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends using clinician and patient reminder systems, using small media (such as videos, letters, and brochures), reducing structural barriers to screening (such as the time or distance to the screening delivery setting or offering extended or nonstandard clinic hours), and providing clinician assessment and feedback about screening rates (more information is available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.thecommunityguide.org/cancer/index.html"" target=""_blank"">www.thecommunityguide.org/cancer</a><a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/exit-disclaimer"" title=""This link goes offsite.

<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
<p>Higher-quality data are needed about the natural history of small (&lt;10 mm) adenomas to improve understanding of optimal screening and surveillance strategies and to guide when clinical intervention is necessary. Further, because determining the ultimate worth of a screening method requires an accurate assessment of the net benefit of that intervention, randomized trials are needed to directly compare different types of colorectal cancer screening programs to more clearly define their relative benefits and harms; however, the USPSTF appreciates the challenges inherent in performing such trials, given the large sample sizes and long time horizons required.A recent analysis of data from the National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program suggests that the incidence of colorectal cancer may be increasing among adults younger than 50 years.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation20"">20</a>&nbsp;Modeling suggests there may be some potential advantages to starting colonoscopy screening at an earlier age (45 years) and to extending the interval between screenings with negative findings.Black and Alaska Native individuals have a higher incidence of and mortality rate from colorectal cancer compared with the general population. Empirical data about the effectiveness of different screening strategies for these at-risk populations are not available.Although there is a growing body of evidence on the test performance characteristics of CT colonography, evidence to bound the potential harms of this technology is still lacking, particularly in regard to incidental findings. More consistent and complete reporting, in studies with longer-term follow-up, of the downstream consequences of initial detection, subsequent workup, and definitive treatment of extracolonic findings (ie, CT Colonography Reporting and Data System findings categorized as E3&mdash;&ldquo;likely unimportant finding, incompletely characterized: subject to local practice and patient preference, workup may be indicated&rdquo; and E4&mdash;&ldquo;potentially important finding: communicate to referring physician as per accepted practice guidelines&rdquo;) would allow for better understanding of the net benefit associated with this screening approach.Empirical evidence is lacking on the appropriate follow-up of abnormal results from FIT-DNA screening when the initial diagnostic colonoscopy is negative. There is a theoretical concern that FIT-DNA may generate inappropriate use of surveillance colonoscopy if clinicians and patients place increased importance on the genetic component of the test. At present, evidence is lacking to establish the optimal frequency of screening with the FIT-DNA test. As a condition of its approval of the test, the FDA required the manufacturer to conduct a longitudinal study examining the test characteristics of a 3-year screening interval; these data should help inform decisions.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation21"">21</a>Studies on patient adherence to the various screening options, within single-method screening programs over time, as well as factors that may influence adherence across different screening methods, are needed to help better inform and improve uptake of screening across eligible populations.</p>
<h3><em>Update to Previous USPSTF Recommendations</em></h3>
<p>This is an update of the 2008 USPSTF recommendation.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation27"">27</a>&nbsp;In 2008, the USPSTF recommended screening with colonoscopy every 10 years, annual FIT, annual high-sensitivity FOBT, or flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years combined with high-sensitivity FOBT every 3 years. In the current recommendation, instead of emphasizing specific screening approaches, the USPSTF has instead chosen to highlight that there is convincing evidence that colorectal cancer screening substantially reduces deaths from the disease among adults aged 50 to 75 years and that not enough adults in the United States are using this effective preventive intervention. The reasons for this gap between evidence and practice are multifaceted and will require sustained effort among clinicians, policy makers, advocates, and patients to overcome.</p>
<h3><em>Recommendatoins of Others</em></h3>
<p>Many organizations have issued guidelines concerning screening for colorectal cancer. All of the following recommendations apply to average-risk adults 50 years and older.In 2008, the American Cancer Society, American College of Radiology, and the US Multi-Society Task Force (including the American Gastroenterological Association, American College of Gastroenterology, and American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy) jointly issued recommendations. They prioritized flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, colonoscopy every 10 years, double-contrast barium enema every 5 years, and CT colonography every 5 years as preferred tests &ldquo;designed to both prevent and detect cancer&rdquo; if resources are available but also recommended annual high-sensitivity gFOBT or FIT-DNA testing (interval uncertain).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation8"">8</a>&nbsp;Shortly thereafter, the American College of Gastroenterology released an independent guideline recommending colonoscopy every 10 years as the single preferred screening strategy. It stated that if colonoscopy is not available or is unacceptable to a patient, recommended alternative strategies include flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 to 10 years or CT colonography every 5 years (preferred) or annual FIT, annual Hemoccult II SENSA, or FIT-DNA testing every 3 years (acceptable).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation28"">28</a>In 2012, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommended colonoscopy every 10 years as the preferred screening strategy if available; otherwise, it recommended annual gFOBT or FIT, with or without flexible sigmoidoscopy, every 5 years or flexible sigmoidoscopy alone every 5 years as secondary approaches to screening.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation29"">29</a>In 2015, the American College of Physicians recommended that average-risk adults aged 50 to 75 years should be screened for colorectal cancer by 1 of 4 strategies: 1) annual high-sensitivity gFOBT or FIT, 2) flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, 3) high-sensitivity gFOBT or FIT every 3 years plus flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, or 4) colonoscopy every 10 years. It advised that average-risk adults younger than 50 years, older than 75 years, or with an estimated life expectancy of less than 10 years should not be screened.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation30"">30</a>&nbsp;The American Academy of Family Physicians is in the process of updating its guidelines.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation31"">31</a>In 2016, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommended that adults aged 50 to 59 years (weak recommendation) and 60 to 74 years (strong recommendation) be screened for colorectal cancer with gFOBT or FIT every 2 years or flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years. It recommended against screening in adults 75 years and older (weak recommendation) and using colonoscopy as a primary screening test (weak recommendation).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation32"">32</a></p>","Scope of Review
The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review1, 6 to update its 2008 recommendation on screening for colorectal cancer. The review addressed the following: 1) the effectiveness of screening with colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, CT colonography, gFOBT, FIT, FIT-DNA, and methylated SEPT9 DNA testing in reducing incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer or all-cause mortality; 2) the harms of these screening tests; and 3) the test performance characteristics of these tests for detecting adenomatous polyps, advanced adenomas based on size, or both, as well as colorectal cancer. In contrast to the evidence review performed for the USPSTF in 2008, this review expanded its approach to additionally search for and consider 1) observational evidence about the benefits of screening tests when trial evidence does not exist and 2) comparative effectiveness of screening tests on cancer incidence and mortality.
In addition, the USPSTF commissioned a report from the CISNET Colorectal Cancer Working Group2, 12 to provide information from comparative modeling on optimal starting and stopping ages and screening intervals across the different available screening methods. Compared with the previous decision analysis performed for the USPSTF, this analysis used more narrowly defined ages at which to begin and end screening and screening intervals. It also included new screening methods (FIT-DNA, CT colonography, and flexible sigmoidoscopy combined with FIT), updated test characteristics, and age-specific risks of colonoscopy complications.
Accuracy of Screening Tests
All of the available studies of the test characteristics of different screening methods evaluated 1-time application of the test. As such, it is not possible to draw meaningful inferences about the ultimate performance of these tests as intended in a real-world setting (ie, in a program of repeated screening over time).
High-sensitivity gFOBT (Hemoccult SENSA; Beckman Coulter) has a sensitivity of 62% to 79% and a specificity of 87% to 96% for detecting colorectal cancer.1 Fecal immunochemical tests can be grouped according to whether they are qualitative (fixed cutoff) or quantitative (adjustable cutoff) assays; overall, test performance among this class of stool-based tests varies widely. Sensitivity and specificity of the OC-Light test using a cutoff of 10 μg hemoglobin (Hb)/g feces to detect colorectal cancer range from 79% to 88% and 91% to 93%, respectively;1 sensitivity and specificity of the OC FIT-CHEK family of tests using a cutoff of 20 μg Hb/g feces (as directed by the manufacturer) to detect colorectal cancer range from 73% to 75% and 91% to 95%, respectively.1 In the largest study assessing the test characteristics of the only FIT-DNA test available in the United States (Cologuard; Exact Sciences), its sensitivity and specificity to detect colorectal cancer was 92% (95% CI, 84% to 97%) and 84% (95% CI, 84% to 85%), respectively. Its sensitivity to detect advanced precancerous lesions (advanced adenomas and sessile serrated polyps measuring ≥1 cm) was 42% (95% CI, 39% to 46%), and its specificity to detect “all nonadvanced findings” (including nonneoplastic findings and negative colonoscopy findings) was 87% (95% CI, 86% to 87%).13 A second, smaller study involving Alaska Native individuals confirmed that FIT-DNA testing has higher sensitivity but lower specificity than FITs to detect colorectal neoplasia with 1-time use.22
Colonoscopy is generally considered the criterion standard for test characteristic studies, although it does miss some cases of colorectal cancer. No studies have evaluated the test performance characteristics of flexible sigmoidoscopy against a colonoscopy standard in an average-risk screening population.1 Studies of CT colonography have not been powered to estimate its ability to detect cancer. Studies of CT colonography test performance with bowel preparation found that the per-person sensitivity to detect adenomas measuring 10 mm or larger ranged from 67% to 94%; specificity ranged from 86% to 98%. Only 2 studies evaluated the performance of CT colonography without bowel preparation; they found sensitivity and specificity to detect adenomas measuring 10 mm or larger ranging from 67% to 90% and 85% to 97%, respectively.1
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment
The USPSTF found convincing evidence of benefit associated with colorectal cancer screening. The Hemoccult II test was the first colorectal cancer screening test to demonstrate reduction in disease-specific mortality in an RCT. Six trials showed that after 11 to 30 years of follow-up, screening with low-sensitivity gFOBT reduced the risk of colorectal cancer death by about 9% to 22% when performed biennially (about 9 to 16 fewer colorectal cancer deaths per 100,000 person-years) and by about 32% when done annually.1 When considering the life-years gained compared with the burden and harms of screening (as assessed by the proxy measure of total number of lifetime colonoscopies), annual screening with high-sensitivity gFOBT was consistently dominated by annual FIT screening in the CISNET modeling.2
Flexible sigmoidoscopy has also been assessed in multiple RCTs. Pooled meta-analysis of 4 trials demonstrated that 1-time screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy reduced the risk of dying of colorectal cancer by 27% after about 11 to 12 years (incidence rate ratio, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.66 to 0.82]), or about 9 to 14 fewer colorectal cancer deaths per 100,000 person-years.1 The Norwegian Colorectal Cancer Prevention Trial found that its flexible sigmoidoscopy–plus-FIT group had a lower colorectal cancer–specific mortality rate than the flexible sigmoidoscopy–only group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.62 [95% CI, 0.42 to 0.90] vs 0.84 [95% CI, 0.61 to 1.17]).14 The CISNET models estimated that screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy from the ages of 50 to 75 years, repeated every 5 years, would result in about 181 to 227 life-years gained per 1,000 persons screened over a lifetime. However, a combined approach of flexible sigmoidoscopy repeated every 10 years with annual FIT screening was estimated to result in about 246 to 270 life-years gained per 1,000 persons screened (although it would also increase the total number of diagnostic and surveillance colonoscopies required).2
No RCTs have evaluated the effect of colonoscopy on colorectal cancer mortality, although several are in progress (Spanish COLONPREV, Swedish SCREESCO, and US CONFIRM trials),23-26 including 1 trial (Northern European Initiative on Colorectal Cancer) with a control group of no screening.24 One large (n=88,902), fair-quality prospective cohort study combining data from the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study found an association between self-reported receipt of screening colonoscopy and reduced distal and proximal colorectal cancer mortality (multivariate HR, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.10 to 0.31] and 0.47 [95% CI, 0.29 to 0.67], respectively).15 Although the investigators adjusted for known potential risk factors for colorectal cancer, given the study design, they could not address unknown or unmeasured confounders. In addition, it is unclear based on the study design whether the benefit accrued from 1 or multiple colonoscopies or screening plus surveillance colonoscopy. Overall, the study likely overestimates the magnitude of benefit associated with colonoscopy; the observed effect size in this study also cannot be directly compared with that measured in randomized trials of other colorectal cancer screening methods.
The CISNET models commissioned for this review estimated the number of life-years gained, colorectal cancer deaths averted, lifetime colonoscopies required (as a proxy measure for the burden of screening), and resulting complications (ie, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular events) for various screening strategies, varying the age at which to start and stop screening and the frequency of screening. With an age to begin screening of 50 years and an age to end screening of 75 years, assuming 100% adherence to screening over a lifetime, 4 screening strategies were estimated to provide an efficient balance of benefits and harms while also providing roughly comparable life-years gained: colonoscopy every 10 years, annual FIT, flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years combined with annual FIT, and CT colonography every 5 years. For CT colonography, the findings depend on the perspective taken: if lifetime number of colonoscopies is used as the proxy measure for the burden of screening, it is efficient; if cathartic bowel preparations are considered as the proxy measure, it is not efficient. The CISNET models estimated that these strategies would produce about 226 to 275 life-years gained over a lifetime, or about 20 to 24 colorectal cancer deaths averted per 1,000 adults aged 50 to 75 years screened.2
Harms of Early Detection and Treatment
The USPSTF found adequate evidence of harms associated with different colorectal cancer screening programs. With all screening methods, positive findings lead to follow-up colonoscopy to resolve the diagnosis; colonoscopy represents the primary source of harms associated with colorectal cancer screening. As an invasive procedure, colonoscopy can produce important morbidity as well as anxiety and discomfort. Bowel preparation may lead to dehydration or electrolyte imbalances, particularly in older adults or those with comorbid conditions; accurate estimates of the rates of these events are not available. If sedation is used during colonoscopy, cardiopulmonary events may rarely occur; the precise frequency of occurrence is also not known.
Screening with FIT-DNA and CT colonography each has several unique harms to consider. Screening with FIT-DNA is less specific than screening with FIT, 13, 22 resulting in more false-positive results per screening test and an increased probability of harm from diagnostic colonoscopy. Further, a theoretical concern about FIT-DNA is whether its use might lead to more frequent and invasive follow-up testing in persons who are not at increased risk of colorectal cancer because of patient or clinician concerns about abnormal DNA results. Although modeling can be used to understand the estimated effects of the test’s reduced specificity and increased false-positive rate, empirical evidence on appropriate follow-up of abnormal results is lacking, making it difficult to accurately understand the overall balance of benefits and harms of this screening test.
Extracolonic findings detected on CT colonography are common, occurring in about 40% to 70% of screening tests.1 About 5% to 37% of these extracolonic findings require diagnostic follow-up, and about 3% need definitive treatment.1 These findings have the potential for both benefit and harm. Potential harms include additional diagnostic testing of an abnormality that is of no clinical importance, as well as treatment of findings that may never threaten a patient’s health or even become apparent without screening (ie, overdiagnosis and overtreatment). Radiation-induced cancer is a potential long-term concern with repeated use of CT colonography. No studies directly measured this risk, but radiation exposure during the procedure seems to be low, with a maximum exposure of about 7 mSv per examination.1 In comparison, annual background radiation exposure in the United States is 3 mSv per year per person. Although 7 new studies have examined the potential harms associated with CT colonography since the prior USPSTF review,1 high-quality evidence to draw clear conclusions about the ultimate clinical effect associated with the detection and subsequent workup of extracolonic findings remains lacking. Given the frequency with which these incidental findings occur, it is difficult to accurately understand the overall balance of benefits and harms of this screening test without this information.
The direct harms of endoscopy have been somewhat better studied.1 Pooled estimates suggest there are about 4 (95% CI, 2 to 5) colonic perforations and about 8 (95% CI, 5 to 14) major intestinal bleeding episodes per 10,000 screening colonoscopies performed.1 Many of these events appear to be related to polypectomy, and the risk of experiencing an adverse event increases with age.1 The risk of bleeding or perforation seems to be greater if the colonoscopy is done as part of diagnostic follow-up of a positive finding on a screening test of a different method; for example, pooled data from flexible sigmoidoscopy trials found about 14 (95% CI, 9 to 26) colonic perforations and 24 (95% CI, 5 to 63) major bleeding episodes per 10,000 persons undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy.1 This compares to about 1 perforation and 2 major bleeding episodes per 10,000 flexible sigmoidoscopies performed for the purposes of cancer screening.1
The harms from a single administration of a screening test must be considered in the context of how often the test will be repeated over a patient’s lifetime. In the case of colorectal cancer screening, this means considering how many colonoscopies (the primary source of serious harms) will be required to follow up abnormal findings. The CISNET models suggest that the available strategies range from an estimated 1,714 to 4,049 total colonoscopies required per 1,000 persons screened over a lifetime; screening colonoscopy every 10 years generates the highest degree of associated burden or harm (Figure).2
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in average-risk, asymptomatic adults aged 50 to 75 years is of substantial net benefit. Multiple screening strategies are available to choose from, with different levels of evidence to support their effectiveness, as well as unique advantages and limitations (Table).
For older adults aged 76 to 85 years, the benefits of screening for colorectal cancer decline and the risk of experiencing serious associated harms increases. The most important consideration for clinicians and patients in this age group is whether the patient has previously been screened. Patients in this age group who have never been screened for colorectal cancer are more likely to benefit than those who have been previously screened. Other factors that should be considered include whether the patient has other chronic health conditions and would be healthy enough to undergo treatment if cancer was found.
Screening for colorectal cancer is a substantially underused preventive health strategy in the United States.19 In addition, there are no empirical data to suggest that any of the strategies provide a greater net benefit. Accordingly, the best screening test is the one that gets done, and the USPSTF concludes that maximizing the total proportion of the eligible population that receives screening will result in the greatest reduction in colorectal cancer deaths.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from October 6 to November 2, 2015. Many comments expressed concern that the terms “recommended” and “alternative” to describe the testing strategies lacked clarity and were confusing to interpret. In response, the USPSTF removed these terms from the final recommendation to better communicate the primary message of importance: there is convincing evidence that screening for colorectal cancer provides substantial benefit for adults aged 50 to 75 years, and a sizable proportion of the eligible US population is not taking advantage of this effective preventive health strategy. With this recommendation, the USPSTF acknowledges that there is no “one size fits all” approach to colorectal cancer screening and seeks to provide clinicians and patients with the best possible evidence about the various screening methods to enable informed, individual decision making. Accordingly, both the Table and Figure were updated to provide more detailed information about the available evidence on the effectiveness of each method, as well as the strengths, limitations, and unique considerations for the various screening tests.","<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in the United States. In 2016, an estimated 134,000 persons will be diagnosed with the disease, and about 49,000 will die from it. Colorectal cancer is most frequently diagnosed among adults aged 65 to 74 years; the median age at death from colorectal cancer is 68 years.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation3"">3</a></p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening for colorectal cancer with several different methods can accurately detect early-stage colorectal cancer and adenomatous polyps.<br /><br />Although single test performance is an important issue in the detection of colorectal cancer, the sensitivity of the test over time is more important in an ongoing screening program. However, data that permit assessment and direct comparison of screening methods to detect colorectal neoplasia in screening programs over time are limited to those from analytic modeling.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Screening and Early Intervention</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 75 years reduces colorectal cancer mortality. The USPSTF found no head-to-head studies demonstrating that any of the screening strategies it considered are more effective than others, although the tests have varying levels of evidence supporting their effectiveness, as well as different strengths and limitations (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#tab"">Table</a>). About one-third of eligible adults in the United States have never been screened for colorectal cancer,<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation4"">4</a>&nbsp;and offering choice in colorectal cancer screening strategies may increase screening uptake.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation5"">5</a>&nbsp;As such, the screening tests are not presented in any preferred or ranked order; rather, the goal is to maximize the total number of persons who are screened because that will have the largest effect on reducing colorectal cancer deaths.<br /><br />The benefit of early detection of and intervention for colorectal cancer declines after age 75 years. Among older adults who have been previously screened for colorectal cancer, there is at best a moderate benefit to continuing screening during the ages of 76 to 85 years. However, adults in this age group who have never been screened for colorectal cancer are more likely to benefit than those who have been previously screened.<br /><br />The time between detection and treatment of colorectal cancer and realization of a subsequent mortality benefit can be substantial. As such, the benefit of early detection of and intervention for colorectal cancer in adults 86 years and older is at most small.<br /><br />To date, no method of screening for colorectal cancer has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality in any age group.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation6"">6</a></p>
<h3>Harms of Screening and Early Intervention</h3>
<p>The harms of screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 75 years are small. The majority of harms result from the use of colonoscopy, either as the screening test or as follow-up for positive findings detected by other screening tests. The rate of serious adverse events from colorectal cancer screening increases with age.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;Thus, the harms of screening for colorectal cancer in adults 76 years and older are small to moderate.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit (ie, the benefit minus the harms) of screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 75 years is substantial.<br /><br />The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years who have been previously screened is small. Adults who have never been screened for colorectal cancer are more likely to benefit.</p>",Screening for Colorectal Cancer ,"Colorectal Cancer, Screening, 2016"
"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to adults 18 years and older. It does not apply to children and adolescents, who are addressed in a separate USPSTF recommendation statement (available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
The USPSTF recommends screening in all adults regardless of risk factors. However, a number of factors are associated with an increased risk of depression. Among general adult populations, prevalence rates vary by sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, geographic location, and employment status. Women, young and middle-aged adults, and nonwhite persons have higher rates of depression than their counterparts, as do persons who are undereducated, previously married, or unemployed. Other groups who are at increased risk of developing depression include persons with chronic illnesses (eg, cancer or cardiovascular disease), other mental health disorders (including substance misuse), or a family history of psychiatric disorders.Among older adults, risk factors for depression include disability and poor health status related to medical illness, complicated grief, chronic sleep disturbance, loneliness, and a history of depression. However, the presence or absence of risk factors alone cannot distinguish patients with depression from those without depression.Risk factors for depression during pregnancy and postpartum include poor self-esteem, child-care stress, prenatal anxiety, life stress, decreased social support, single/unpartnered relationship status, history of depression, difficult infant temperament, previous postpartum depression, lower socioeconomic status, and unintended pregnancy.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Commonly used depression screening instruments include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) in various forms and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales in adults, the Geriatric Depression Scale in older adults, and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in postpartum and pregnant women. All positive screening results should lead to additional assessment that considers severity of depression and comorbid psychological problems (eg, anxiety, panic attacks, or substance abuse), alternate diagnoses, and medical conditions.
<h3>Screening Timing and Interval</h3>
There is little evidence regarding the optimal timing for screening. The optimum interval for screening for depression is also unknown; more evidence for all populations is needed to identify ideal screening intervals. A pragmatic approach in the absence of data might include screening all adults who have not been screened previously and using clinical judgment in consideration of risk factors, comorbid conditions, and life events to determine if additional screening of high-risk patients is warranted.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
Effective treatment of depression in adults generally includes antidepressants or specific psychotherapy approaches (eg, CBT or brief psychosocial counseling), alone or in combination. Given the potential harms to the fetus and newborn child from certain pharmacologic agents, clinicians are encouraged to consider CBT or other evidence-based counseling interventions when managing depression in pregnant or breastfeeding women.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
The Community Preventive Services Task Force, which makes evidence-based recommendations on preventive services for community populations, recommends collaborative care for the management of depressive disorders as part of a multicomponent, health care system&ndash;level intervention that uses case managers to link primary care providers, patients, and mental health specialists. More information about the Community Preventive Services Task Force and its recommendations on depression interventions is available on its website (<a href=""http://www.thecommunityguide.org/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.thecommunityguide.org</a><a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/exit-disclaimer"" title=""This link goes offsite.

The USPSTF recommends that screening be implemented with adequate systems in place. &ldquo;Adequate systems in place&rdquo; refers to having systems and clinical staff to ensure that patients are screened and, if they screen positive, are appropriately diagnosed and treated with evidence-based care or referred to a setting that can provide the necessary care. These essential functions can be provided through a wide range of different arrangements of clinician types and settings. In the available evidence, the lowest effective level of support consisted of a designated nurse who advised resident physicians of positive screening results and provided a protocol that facilitated referral to evidence-based behavioral treatment.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;At the highest level, support included screening; staff and clinician training (1- or 2-day workshops); clinician manuals; monthly training lectures; academic detailing; materials for clinicians, staff, and patients; an initial visit with a nurse specialist for assessment, education, and discussion of patient preferences and goals; a visit with a trained nurse specialist for follow-up assessment and ongoing support for medication adherence; a visit with a trained therapist for CBT; and a reduced copayment for patients referred for psychotherapy.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation2"">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation3"">3</a> Multidisciplinary team&ndash;based primary care that includes self management support and care coordination has been shown to be effective in management of depression. These components of primary care are detailed in recommendations from the Community Preventive Services Task Force.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation4"">4</a>&nbsp;It recommends collaborative care for the treatment of major depression in adults 18 years and older on the basis of strong evidence of effectiveness in improving short-term treatment outcomes. As defined, collaborative care and disease management of depressive disorders include a systematic, multicomponent, and team-based approach that &ldquo;strengthens and supports self-care, while assuring that effective medical, preventive, and health maintenance interventions take place&rdquo; to improve the quality and outcome of patient care.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation4"">4</a>
<h3>Costs</h3>
The economic burden of depression is substantial for individuals as well as society. Costs to an individual may include emotional suffering, reduced quality of personal relationships, possible adverse effects from treatment, cost of mental health and medical visits and medications, time away from work and lost wages, and cost of transportation. Costs to society may include loss of life, reduced productivity (because of both diminished capacity while at work and absenteeism from work), and increased costs of mental health and medical care.
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Gaps in the evidence on screening for depression in older adults in primary care include a lack of information from large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in settings that are applicable to the US population. More research is needed on the accuracy of screening tools in languages other than English and Spanish and to identify the timing and optimal screening interval in all populations. Data are lacking on both the accuracy of screening and the benefits and harms of treatment in pregnant women, as well as for the balance of benefits and harms of treatment with antidepressants in postpartum women. Finally, research is needed to assess barriers to establishing adequate systems of care and how these barriers can be addressed.","Burden of Disease
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and significant health care problem. It is the leading cause of disability among adults in high income countries and is associated with increased mortality due to suicide and impaired ability to manage other health issues. Depression has a major effect on quality of life for the patient and affects family members, especially children. Depression also imposes a significant economic burden through direct and indirect costs. In the United States, an estimated $22.8 billion was spent on depression treatment in 2009, and lost productivity cost an additional estimated $23 billion in 2011.5
Scope of Review
The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to update its 2009 recommendation, which focused on the direct evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for depression in adult populations, including older adults and pregnant and postpartum women. The USPSTF also reviewed the evidence on the accuracy of depression screening instruments and the benefits and harms of depression treatment in these populations.
Accuracy of Screening Tests
General Adult Population and Older Adults
The accuracy of screening tests in the general adult population was established in the 2002 and 2009 USPSTF reviews and found to be convincing.
Pregnant and Postpartum Women
Twenty-three studies (n = 5398), including 8 studies of the English-language version, compared the accuracy of the EPDS with a diagnostic interview.6 Sensitivity of the English-language EPDS with a cutoff score of 13 ranged from 0.67 (95% CI, 0.18–0.96) to 1.00 (95% CI, 0.67–1.00), and specificity for detecting MDD was consistently at least 0.90. In the 2 trials conducted in the United States,7, 8 including a recent study in low-income African American women, sensitivity for detecting MDD ranged from 0.78 to 0.81. This suggests that the average sensitivity of the EPDS with a cutoff score of 13 in the United States is approximately 0.80, and the positive predictive value for detecting MDD would be 47% to 64% in a population with a 10% prevalence of MDD. The Spanish-language version also showed acceptable performance characteristics. No studies of screening in pregnant and postpartum women with the 9-item PHQ or other versions met inclusion criteria.
Effectiveness of Screening and Treatment
General Adult Population and Older Adults
Nine good- or fair-quality trials addressed screening in general adults (5 trials; n = 2924) and older adults (4 trials; n = 890). Seven studies were conducted in the United States, and 2 (in older adults) were conducted in the Netherlands. Most studies were published in the 1990s and early 2000s; only 1 (in older adults) of the 9 trials was published since the previous systematic review. One study in general adults directly compared screening with usual care case-finding,9 while the other studies screened all patients for depression, enrolled only those screening positive, and returned results of screening to clinicians in the intervention group only.6 Studies included a range of additional treatment components along with providing screening result feedback to clinicians.
Improvements in remission, response rates, or both in the general adult population ranged from 17% to 87%. Other outcomes were sparsely reported. The effect of screening on remission, response rates, or both in the trials of older adults was minimal. However, both of the trials in older adults that showed a paradoxical effect were conducted in the Netherlands, and the trial with the worst outcomes had a number of features that may have affected its reliability, including external referrals for depression treatment, very low uptake of treatment (19%), and high mortality and morbidity in the intervention group, suggesting that the control and intervention groups may have been different at baseline.
The 2009 USPSTF recommendation concluded that the evidence was sufficient to establish the benefits of treatment of depression in general adult populations, including older adults.10 A systematic review of intention-to-treat trials comparing 3 groups of adult patients who received antidepressants, psychotherapy, or a control condition reported a 46% remission rate with antidepressants and a 48% remission rate with psychotherapy after 10 to 16 weeks.11 Two systematic reviews concluded that antidepressants were effective in treating depression in older adults. In 1 review, older adults who received antidepressants were twice as likely to have remission from major or minor depression as older adults who received placebo (odds ratio [OR], 2.03 [CI, 1.67–2.46]).12 The other review indicated that among community-dwelling older adults, 36% of those who received antidepressants were in remission at the end of the study compared with 21% of those who received placebo (OR, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.61–2.86]).13 In addition, 2 good-quality systematic reviews on the efficacy of psychotherapy in older adults found that older adults who received psychotherapy were more than twice as likely to have remission as those who received no treatment (OR, 2.47 [95% CI, 1.76–3.47] vs 2.63 [95% CI, 1.96–3.53]).12, 14
Pregnant and Postpartum Women
The USPSTF identified 6 fair- or good-quality trials (n = 11,869) (5 in postpartum women and 1 in pregnant women) that assessed the effect of screening for depression in pregnant and postpartum women.6 Trial participants were identified through primary care settings using the EPDS (cutoff scores varied) and included women with and without depression. None of the trials simply compared usual care with screening plus usual care. Two trials assessed minimal additional intervention beyond screening or feedback of screening results in postpartum15 and pregnant16 women, 2 trials assessed the effects of screening plus provider supports in postpartum women,16, 17 and 2 trials assessed feedback of screening results plus adjunctive counseling by home health visitors in postpartum women.18, 19 Studies varied by geographical location (United States, northern Europe, United Kingdom, and Hong Kong), length of follow-up (11 weeks to 16 months), and baseline depression rates (10% to 28%).
Despite the variation in trial design and population, results were reasonably consistent across the range of designs. Trials in postpartum women showed 28% to 59% reductions in risk of depression at follow-up compared with usual care. The reported effect was smaller (18%) and did not reach significance in the trial of pregnant women but was in the same direction.16 The 4 studies that reported remission or response rates reported significant improvements in both postpartum and pregnant women. The most applicable trial (US trial of screening plus provider supports) found that 45% of intervention participants reported a 5-point or greater reduction in 9-item PHQ score (an improvement considered to be clinically important) compared with 35% percent of usual care participants (OR, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.05–5.86]; adjusted for depression history, marital status, income, education, age, and degree of parenting stress).17
Eighteen trials examined the benefits of treatment interventions in women who screened positive for depression in primary care or community settings. Fifteen trials were in postpartum women (usually 6–12 weeks postpartum) and 3 trials were in pregnant women,20-22 but all reported outcomes during the postpartum period. Only 1 small, short-term trial of screen-detected depression in postpartum women included antidepressants as an intervention.23 The most commonly studied approach was CBT or related interventions that included CBT components. All 10 trials of CBT or CBT-related interventions, including the 2 trials in pregnant women, showed an increased likelihood of remission with treatment in the short term (≤7.8 months). The magnitude of effect in pregnant women was similar to that in postpartum women. Pooled results that used only the longest follow-up period within 1 year showed a 35% increase in the likelihood of remission with CBT (DerSimonian and Laird pooled relative risk, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.19–1.50]; k = 10; I2 = 7.9%) compared with usual care. The other 8 non-CBT studies examined a diverse range of interventions but did not provide sufficient evidence to draw conclusions for any one approach. There was also insufficient evidence to assess differences in effectiveness for patient subgroups.
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
General Adult Population and Older Adults
One trial in general adults reported no adverse events attributable to screening in a subset of participants with newly-identified depression;24 none of the other effectiveness trials in general adults reported on harms. One trial in older adults reported paradoxical effects from screening, as previously discussed. No additional studies addressing harms of screening were identified in the review.
The 2009 USPSTF review found 7 studies that compared suicide-related events in adults who received SSRIs and other second-generation antidepressants vs placebo. No studies reported a significant increase in completed suicide rates in adults who received antidepressants compared with those who received placebo, although completed suicides were rare and, as a result, the power to detect a significant difference was limited.25 For adults older than 65 years, antidepressant use seemed to be protective against suicidal behavior (OR, 0.06 [95% CI, 0.01–0.58]).26 In addition, the 2009 USPSTF review identified 1 fair-quality study on bleeding risk in older adults who received SSRIs. Although patients 16 years and older were at increased risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding during SSRI use, the risk increased significantly with age, from 4.1 hospitalizations per 1000 adults aged 65 to 70 years to 12.3 hospitalizations per 1000 adults aged 80 to 89 years. The odds of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults aged 40 to 79 years who were taking SSRIs (adjusted OR, 3.0 [95% CI, 2.1–4.4]) was much higher when they were also taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (adjusted OR, 15.6 [95% CI, 6.6–36.6]).27
Pregnant and Postpartum Women
Only 1 trial, which focused on the effects of screening alone in postpartum women, specifically reported on adverse effects of screening and found none.15 None of the other screening trials showed any signals of concern. The literature search did not identify additional trials addressing harms of screening.
None of the trials addressing the benefits of behavioral-based interventions reported on harms of treatment. In addition, none of the trials showed paradoxical effects of concern. The review found no additional trials addressing the harms of behavioral-based interventions beyond those that were included for the benefits of treatment. The majority of the evidence on the harms of antidepressants was drawn from a good-quality comprehensive systematic review on the comparative effectiveness and safety of antidepressant treatment for depression in pregnant and postpartum women sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.28 This review included studies published between 1996 and 2013 and was supplemented with 12 additional fair- to good-quality observational studies (n = 4,759,435) published after the review.6 The review included 15 observational studies that provided evidence on the harms of antidepressants at unknown dosages in pregnant women with depression and an additional 109 observational studies that provided evidence on the harms of antidepressants in pregnant women whose depression status in either or both treatment groups was unknown. This observational evidence shows that second-generation antidepressant use during pregnancy may be associated with a small increase in risk of preeclampsia, postpartum hemorrhage, miscarriage, perinatal death, preterm birth, serotonin withdrawal syndrome, respiratory distress, pulmonary hypertension, major malformations, cardiac malformations, and being small for gestational age.
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
General Adult Population and Older Adults
The evidence from 5 RCTS, in addition to indirect evidence reviewed for the 2009 recommendation, supports moderate certainty that screening for depression in general adults is of moderate net benefit. The evidence for older adults is less clear, because the trials that assessed the direct effect of screening found no benefit and possibly even harm. However, given the strength of the indirect evidence (the accuracy of screening in older adults and the effectiveness of treatment in older adults), the inclusion of adults older than 65 years in the studies of all adults, and the weakness of the direct evidence on screening in older adults, the USPSTF concludes that the weight of evidence still favors a net benefit. However, more research on optimal screening approaches in older adults is imperative.
Pregnant and Postpartum Women
Direct and indirect evidence support moderate certainty that screening for depression in pregnant and postpartum women is of moderate net benefit. Six RCTs with varying degrees of additional support found direct benefit of screening, 23 studies confirmed the accuracy of the EPDS for identifying MDD, and 10 RCTs found benefit of treatment with CBT.6 Although most of the evidence (except for evidence on harms of SSRIs) is in postpartum women, the direction and magnitude of effect in pregnant women was consistent with the outcomes for postpartum women and for adults in general. It is important to note that the evidence on treatment benefit is primarily for nonpharmacologic interventions (ie, CBT), there is evidence of a small risk of harm to fetal health with SSRI use in pregnant women, and there is a lack of evidence on harms of SSRI use in postpartum women. Therefore, it is important that a range of treatment options are available for pregnant and postpartum women with depression who are identified through screening and that treatment choices are made through shared decision making.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from July 28, 2015, to August 24, 2015. A number of comments requested a more detailed definition of what constitutes an “adequate system” for screening. The USPSTF revised the Implementation section to clarify that a range of staff types, organizational arrangements, and settings can be used to support the goals of depression screening and provided a link to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration registry of evidence-based mental health interventions as a resource. Comments suggested that access to depression screening and management resources would be useful. The USPSTF has now provided links to evidence-based depression screening and management toolkits for primary care settings. There were several requests to clarify the potential harms of SSRIs; in response, the USPSTF added information to the Discussion section. Finally, many concerns were expressed about barriers to effectively implementing screening within adequate systems of care; the USPSTF noted this as a research need.","<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Depression is among the leading causes of disability in persons 15 years and older. It affects individuals, families, businesses, and society and is common in patients seeking care in the primary care setting. Depression is also common in postpartum and pregnant women and affects not only the woman but her child as well.</p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening improves the accurate identification of adult patients with depression in primary care settings, including pregnant and postpartum women.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Intervention and Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that programs combining depression screening with adequate support systems in place improve clinical outcomes (ie, reduction or remission of depression symptoms) in adults, including pregnant and postpartum women.The USPSTF found convincing evidence that treatment of adults and older adults with depression identified through screening in primary care settings with antidepressants, psychotherapy, or both decreases clinical morbidity.The USPSTF also found adequate evidence that treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) improves clinical outcomes in pregnant and postpartum women with depression.</p>
<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Intervention and Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the magnitude of harms of screening for depression in adults is small to none.The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the magnitude of harms of treatment with CBT in postpartum and pregnant women is small to none.The USPSTF found that second-generation antidepressants (mostly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) are associated with some harms, such as an increase in suicidal behaviors in adults aged 18 to 29 years and an increased risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults older than 70 years, with risk increasing with age; however, the magnitude of these risks is, on average, small. The USPSTF found evidence of potential serious fetal harms from pharmacologic treatment of depression in pregnant women, but the likelihood of these serious harms is low. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the overall magnitude of harms is small to moderate.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with at least moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit to screening for depression in adults, including older adults, who receive care in clinical practices that have adequate systems in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate follow-up after screening. The USPSTF also concludes with at least moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit to screening for depression in pregnant and postpartum women who receive care in clinical practices that have CBT or other evidence-based counseling available after screening.</p>",Screening for Depression in Adults,"Depression in Adults, Screening, 2016"
"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to children and adolescents aged 18 years or younger who do not have a diagnosis of MDD. This recommendation focuses on screening for MDD and does not address screening for other depressive disorders, such as minor depression or dysthymia.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
The USPSTF recommends screening for MDD in all adolescents but notes that several risk factors might help identify patients who are at higher risk. The causes of MDD are not fully known and likely involve a combination of genetic, biological, and environmental factors. Risk factors for MDD in children and adolescents include female sex; older age; family (especially maternal) history of depression; prior episode of depression; other mental health or behavioral problems; chronic medical illness; overweight and obesity; and, in some studies, Hispanic race/ethnicity. Other psychosocial risk factors include childhood abuse or neglect, exposure to traumatic events (including natural disasters), loss of a loved one or romantic relationship, family conflict, uncertainty about sexual orientation, low socioeconomic status, and poor academic performance.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Many MDD screening instruments have been developed for use in primary care and have been used in adolescents. Two that have been most often studied are the Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents (PHQ-A) and the primary care version of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Data on the accuracy of MDD screening instruments in younger children are limited.
<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>
The USPSTF found no evidence on appropriate or recommended screening intervals, and the optimal interval is unknown. Repeated screening may be most productive in adolescents with risk factors for MDD. Opportunistic screening may be appropriate for adolescents, who may have infrequent health care visits.
<h3>Treatment or Interventions</h3>
Treatment options for MDD in children and adolescents include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, collaborative care, psychosocial support interventions, and complementary and alternative medicine approaches. Fluoxetine is approved by the FDA for treatment of MDD in children aged 8 years or older, and escitalopram is approved for treatment of MDD in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. The FDA has issued a boxed warning for antidepressants, recommending that patients of all ages who start antidepressant therapy be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;Collaborative care is a multicomponent, health care system&ndash;level intervention that uses care managers to link primary care providers, patients, and mental health specialists.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
In deciding whether to screen for MDD in children aged 11 years or younger, primary care providers should consider the following issues.
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
Little is known about the prevalence of MDD in children aged 11 years or younger. The mean age of onset of MDD is about 14 to 15 years. Early onset is associated with worse outcomes. The average duration of a depressive episode in childhood varies widely, from 2 to 17 months.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening for MDD in children. The USPSTF concluded that screening itself is unlikely to be associated with significant harms, aside from opportunity costs, labeling and potential stigma associated with a positive result, and referral for further evaluation and treatment.<br /><br />The USPSTF concluded, on the basis of a previous review, that the use of SSRIs in children is associated with harms, specifically risk for suicidality. Evidence on the harms of psychotherapy alone or in combination with SSRIs in children is limited. Newer studies provide little additional evidence on treatment harms in children and adolescents but do not suggest more risks. Only 4 studies examined the harms of treatment with SSRIs in children and adolescents. These studies found no increased risk for suicidality associated with antidepressant use, but risk for rare events could not be precisely determined because the studies had limited statistical power. No trials of psychotherapy or combined interventions in children examined harms.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
The USPSTF found no evidence on the current frequency of or methods used in primary care for screening for MDD in children.
<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>
The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends collaborative care for the management of depressive disorders, based on strong evidence of effectiveness in improving depression symptoms, adherence and response to treatment, and remission and recovery from depression.

<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
In a separate recommendation statement, the USPSTF concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for suicide risk in primary care settings, including among adolescents (I statement). Other USPSTF recommendations on mental health topics pertaining to children and adolescents, including illicit drug and alcohol use, can be found on the USPSTF Web site (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#Pod5,161,"<h3>Implementation</h3>
Many screening tools are available to identify depression in children and adolescents, and some have been used in primary care. The number of items in each tool, the administrative time required to complete them, and the appropriate ages for screening vary. A positive result on an initial screening test does not necessarily indicate the need for treatment. Screening is usually done in 2 phases: the initial screening is followed by a second phase in which skilled clinicians take into account contextual factors surrounding the patient&rsquo;s current situation, through either additional probing or a formal diagnostic interview. In instances where treatment is recommended, it can be initiated by the screening provider or through referral to another set of treatment providers. A negative result on a screening test, however, does not always preclude referral when clinical judgment or parental concerns suggest it is warranted.<br /><br />The USPSTF recommends that screening be implemented with adequate systems in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate follow-up. Depression can be managed in the primary care or specialist setting or collaboratively in both settings. Treatment options for depression include pharmacologic, behavioral, multimodal, and collaborative care models, some of which require coordination. Finally, inadequate support and follow-up may result in treatment failures or harms, as indicated by the FDA boxed warning. &ldquo;Adequate systems in place&rdquo; refers to having systems and clinical staff to ensure that patients are screened and, if they screen positive, are appropriately diagnosed and treated with evidence-based care or referred to a setting that can provide the necessary care. These essential functions can be provided through a wide range of arrangements of clinician types and settings.
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
The systematic evidence review identified several critical research gaps, including the need for studies of screening for and treatment of MDD in children younger than 11 years. Large, good-quality randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) are also needed to better understand the overarching effects of screening for MDD on intermediate and long-term health outcomes. It would be helpful to quantify the proportion of persons with screen-detected MDD who are treated or referred as well as their willingness and ability to be assessed and treated.<br /><br />The systematic review excluded studies with participants who had comorbid disorders. Children and adolescents with MDD more often have comorbid conditions than those without MDD, particularly in primary care settings. This underscores the importance of additional research in child and adolescent populations that are similar to those found in primary care settings to study the effects of comorbid conditions on screening accuracy, type of MDD treatment selected, and benefits and harms.<br /><br />For treatment of MDD, research needs include well-designed studies of psychotherapy and combined treatments, as well as studies of the benefits and harms of other treatments (such as non-SSRI medications and complementary or alternative approaches). For rare events, meta-analyses are needed that include only children and adolescents with MDD and focus on current FDA-approved medications. Studies with long-term follow-up are also needed.","Burden of Disease
Although it is normal for children and adolescents to experience occasional feelings of sadness and other symptoms of depression, those with MDD have 1 or more major depressive episodes that last at least 2 weeks and cause significant functional impairment across social, occupational, or educational domains. In some children and adolescents with MDD, these symptoms may present as periods of disruptive mood and irritability rather than as a sad mood and may last for weeks, months, or even years. Major depressive disorder is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Morbidity in children and adolescents may be demonstrated through decreased school performance, poor social functioning, early pregnancy, increased physical illness, and substance abuse. Depressed adolescents have more psychiatric and medical hospitalizations than those who are not depressed. Children with depressive disorders have increased health care costs (including general medical and mental health care) compared with those without mental health diagnoses or those with other mental health diagnoses (except conduct disorder). Major depressive disorder also increases the risk for suicide. Ten percent of children aged 5 to 12.9 years and 19% of adolescents aged 13 to 17.9 years with MDD attempt suicide.2
The mean age of onset of MDD in childhood and adolescence is about 14 to 15 years, and onset is earlier in girls than boys. In 2 nationally representative U.S. surveys, about 8% of adolescents reported having MDD in the past year. Little is known about the prevalence of the disorder in children. The 2005 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that among children and adolescents aged 8 to 15 years, 2% of males and 4% of females reported having MDD in the past year. However, the prevalence of depression in primary care settings is often higher in studies with community samples of children and adolescents. Only 36% to 44% of children and adolescents with depression receive treatment, suggesting that the majority of depressed youth are undiagnosed and untreated.3
Scope of Review
The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to update its 2009 recommendation on screening for child and adolescent MDD among primary care populations.3, 4 To focus on the population most likely to benefit from screening and intervention, the scope of the review was narrowed to focus on screening for and treatment of MDD. In addition, studies of paroxetine were excluded because of the 2003 FDA recommendation that it not be used to treat MDD in children and adolescents because of reports of possible suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in children and adolescents receiving paroxetine for depression. As a result, many studies included in the 2009 review were not included in the updated review. The USPSTF examined the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening; the accuracy of primary care–feasible screening tests; and the benefits and harms of treatment with psychotherapy, medications, and collaborative care models in patients aged 7 to 18 years. Treatment studies were limited to those that were implemented in or received referrals from primary care settings to ensure that the patient population was similar to those who would be identified through screening.
Accuracy of Screening Tests
The USPSTF found 5 good- or fair-quality studies of the accuracy of MDD screening instruments in children and adolescents. One study recruited adolescents from a primary care setting and compared the PHQ-A with a full diagnostic interview by a mental health professional. Four studies recruited adolescents from school settings and compared the screening test with a diagnostic interview or a different screening test. One study evaluated the BDI, 1 evaluated the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), 1 evaluated the BDI and the CES-D, and 1 evaluated the Clinical Interview Schedule–Revised. No studies included children younger than 11 years.
The PHQ-A study had the highest positive predictive value. The authors did not report a diagnostic cutoff score but reported sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 94% for a positive test result.5 Results were not stratified by age, sex, or ethnicity. The 2 BDI studies reported sensitivity ranging from 84% to 90% and specificity ranging from 81% to 86% when a cutoff score of 11 was applied.6, 7 One study7 reported a higher area under the curve for males than for females, but neither of the BDI studies reported results by age or ethnicity.
The CES-D studies used different diagnostic cutoff scores.7, 8 One study enrolled a slightly younger population than the other (age range of 11 to 15 years vs. average age >16 years). Sensitivity ranged from 18% to 84% and specificity ranged from 38% to 83%, depending on the cutoff score used. Results by sex were inconsistent, and neither study stratified results by age or ethnicity. One study evaluated the Clinical Interview Schedule–Revised.9 The mean age was 15.7 years, and sensitivity and specificity were 18% and 97%, respectively. The study did not report other outcomes or stratify results by age, race, or ethnicity.
Effectiveness of Treatment
The USPSTF found 8 fair- or good-quality RCTs that reported health outcomes in children or adolescents with screen-detected MDD who were treated with SSRIs (4 RCTs), psychotherapy (2 RCTs), SSRIs combined with psychotherapy (1 RCT), or collaborative care (1 RCT). Most trials were restricted to adolescents aged 12 to 14 years or older; only 2 of the SSRI trials included children aged 7 or 8 years. Outcomes included treatment response, which was defined differently across studies; symptom severity; and global functioning. Depression outcomes were reported after 8 to 12 weeks of SSRI treatment or psychotherapy, whereas the collaborative care study reported outcomes at 52 weeks.
SSRIs
One good-quality study (n = 221) compared fluoxetine with placebo in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years.10-12 Two fair-quality studies (n = 268 and 316) compared escitalopram with placebo in children and adolescents13 and adolescents only.14 One fair-quality study (n = 178) compared citalopram with placebo in children and adolescents.15 The absolute difference in response favored SSRIs in all 4 studies (range, 2.4% to 25%) and was significant in 2 of the 4 trials. When other outcomes, such as symptom severity or global functioning, were reported, they also favored the SSRI group. One trial examined the efficacy of escitalopram by age group (children vs. adolescents) and found that it was superior to placebo in improving depression symptoms, depression symptom severity, and global functioning in adolescents but not children.13 No trials examined efficacy across sex or race/ethnicity subgroups.
Psychotherapy
Two studies evaluated the benefits of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) compared with placebo (waitlist control or clinical monitoring) in adolescents with MDD and reported nonsignificant improvements in response (43.2% vs. 34.8%) and recovery (odds ratio [OR], 2.15 [95% CI, 0.87 to 5.33]).10, 11, 16 Results for remission (16% vs. 17%) did not differ significantly between groups.
SSRIs Combined With Psychotherapy
One CBT study also compared CBT plus fluoxetine with placebo.10 The CBT plus fluoxetine group showed a 71% response rate versus a 35% response rate in the placebo group, which received a placebo drug and weekly clinical monitoring (P = 0.001).
Collaborative Care
One recent RCT (n = 101) evaluated a 12-month collaborative care intervention in adolescents aged 13 to 17 years who screened positive for depression (60% with MDD) in 9 primary care clinics within 1 health system.17 The intervention was based on the IMPACT (Improving Mood–Promoting Access to Collaborative Treatment) model and was adapted for adolescents. Patients randomly assigned to the collaborative care group had an initial in-person session that included their parents, choice of treatment type, and regular follow-up with depression care managers (28% received psychotherapy alone, 4% received pharmacotherapy alone, and 54% received both). Patients randomly assigned to the usual care control group received screening results and could access mental health services through the usual health care system. Compared with the control group, patients in the collaborative care group had greater reductions in depressive symptoms at 6 and 12 months (8.5- and 9.4-point reductions on the Children’s Depression Rating Scale–Revised, respectively; P < 0.0001 for interaction), better response rates (≥50% score reduction from baseline) at 12 months (OR, 3.3 [CI, 1.4 to 8.2]) and 6 months (not significant), and higher likelihood of remission at 6 months (OR, 5.2 [CI, 1.6 to 17.3]) and 12 months (OR, 3.9 [CI, 1.5 to 10.6]).
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
The USPSTF found no direct evidence on the harms of screening for MDD in adolescents or children.
SSRIs
Five SSRI trials reported on harms and found no significant differences between intervention groups, although none of these studies were powered to detect these differences. Four trials (2 for escitalopram, 1 for citalopram, and 1 for fluoxetine) reported on suicidality (this included worsening suicidal ideation or a suicide attempt; no completed suicides were reported). No studies found significant differences but, again, none were sufficiently powered for this outcome. No studies examined subgroup differences in harms. The USPSTF found no evidence on the long-term (>12 weeks) effects of SSRIs.
Psychotherapy
One CBT trial reported on harms and found no apparent differences in harms-related, suicide-related, or psychiatric adverse events between the CBT and placebo groups.10
SSRIs Combined With Psychotherapy
The same trial also reported on the harms of CBT plus fluoxetine versus placebo and found no apparent differences.10
Collaborative Care
The single trial of collaborative care found no differences in the number of psychiatric hospitalizations between the intervention and control groups (6% vs. 4%). More patients in the control group had an emergency department visit with a primary psychiatric diagnosis (10% vs. 2%). However, this study was not powered to detect differences.17
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening tests can accurately identify MDD in adolescents. It also found adequate evidence that treatment of adolescents with screen-detected MDD is associated with beneficial reductions in symptoms. Although the data are limited, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence on the frequency of medication-related adverse events in adolescents is adequate to estimate that the magnitude of harms of pharmacotherapy is small if patients are closely monitored. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on the harms of psychotherapy and collaborative care in adolescents is adequate to estimate that the magnitude of harms is small to none. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for MDD in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years is associated with moderate net benefit.
The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that screening tests can accurately identify MDD in children and inadequate evidence on the effectiveness of treatment for children with screen-detected MDD. As a result, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to make a recommendation on screening for MDD in children aged 7 to 11 years.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 8 September to 5 October 2015. Many comments focused on the phrase “adequate systems.” Some commenters requested a more detailed definition of what constitutes an adequate system for screening, others recommended removing the conditional term “when,” and others recommended that the requirement for adequate systems be stronger. To clarify the recommendation, the USPSTF separated it into 2 statements: one to support screening, and a second to explain how screening should be implemented. The USPSTF also revised the section on implementation to clarify that a range of staff types, organizational arrangements, and settings can support the goals of depression screening.","<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Depression is a leading cause of disability in the United States. Children and adolescents with MDD typically have functional impairments in their performance at school or work, as well as in their interactions with their families and peers. Depression can also negatively affect the developmental trajectories of affected youth. Major depressive disorder in children and adolescents is strongly associated with recurrent depression in adulthood; other mental disorders; and increased risk for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide completion.<br /><br />In nationally representative U.S. surveys, about 8% of adolescents reported having major depression in the past year. Little is known about the prevalence of MDD in children. Among children and adolescents aged 8 to 15 years, 2% of males and 4% of females reported having MDD in the past year.</p>

<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening instruments for depression can accurately identify MDD in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years in primary care settings. The USPSTF found no studies of screening instruments for depression in children aged 11 years or younger in primary care (or comparable) settings and concluded that the evidence is inadequate.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Intervention and Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found no studies that directly evaluated whether screening for MDD in adolescents in primary care (or comparable) settings leads to improved health and other outcomes. However, the USPSTF found adequate evidence that treatment of MDD detected through screening in adolescents is associated with moderate benefit (for example, improved depression severity, depression symptoms, or global functioning scores).<br /><br />The USPSTF found no studies that directly evaluated whether screening for MDD in children aged 11 years or younger in primary care (or comparable) settings leads to improved health and other outcomes and found inadequate evidence on the benefits of treatment in children with screen-detected MDD.</p>
<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Intervention and Treatme<strong>nt</strong></h3>
<p>The USPSTF found no direct evidence on the harms of screening for MDD in adolescents. Medications for the treatment of depression, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have known harms. However, the magnitude of the harms of pharmacotherapy is small if patients are closely monitored, as recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).<br /><br />The USPSTF found adequate evidence on the harms of psychotherapy and psychosocial support in adolescents and estimates that the magnitude of these harms is small to none.The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening for or treatment of MDD in children aged 11 years or younger.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for MDD in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years has a moderate net benefit.<br /><br />The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on screening for MDD in children aged 11 years or younger is insufficient.

"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to all asymptomatic adults without known liver disease or functional abnormalities.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
The most important risk factor for HCV infection is past or current injection drug use. Another established risk factor for HCV infection is receipt of a blood transfusion before 1992. Because of the implementation of screening programs for donated blood, blood transfusions are no longer an important source of HCV infection. In contrast, 60% of new HCV infections occur in persons who report injection drug use within the past 6 months.<br /><br />Additional risk factors include long-term hemodialysis, being born to an HCV-infected mother, incarceration, intranasal drug use, getting an unregulated tattoo, and other percutaneous exposures (such as in health care workers or from having surgery before the implementation of universal precautions). Evidence on tattoos and other percutaneous exposures as risk factors for HCV infection is limited. The relative importance of these additional risk factors may differ on the basis of geographic location and other factors.<br /><br />Large population-based studies report an independent association between high-risk sexual behaviors (multiple sex partners, unprotected sex, or sex with an HCV-infected person or injection drug user) and HCV infection. However, HCV seems to be inefficiently transmitted through sexual contact, and observed associations may have been confounded by other high-risk behaviors.<br /><br />In 1998, the highest prevalence rates of the anti-HCV antibody occurred in persons with significant direct percutaneous exposures, such as injection drug users and persons with hemophilia (60% to 90%); persons with less significant percutaneous exposures involving smaller amounts of blood, such as patients receiving hemodialysis (10% to 30%), had more moderate prevalence rates. Persons engaging in high-risk sexual behaviors (1% to 10%); recipients of blood transfusions (6%); and persons with infrequent percutaneous exposures, such as health care workers (1% to 2%), had the lowest prevalence rates.Among patients with abnormal results on liver function tests (measurement of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, or bilirubin) who were tested for reasons other than HCV screening, finding the cause of the abnormality often includes testing for HCV infection and is considered case finding rather than screening; therefore, it is outside the scope of this recommendation.<br /><br />In 2010, the overall incidence rate of acute HCV infection was 0.3 cases per 100,000 persons and varied by race or ethnicity. The incidence rate for acute hepatitis C was lowest among persons of Asian or Pacific Islander descent and highest among American Indians and Alaskan natives. Blacks had the highest mortality rates from HCV, at 6.5 to 7.8 deaths per 100,000 persons, according to data from 2004 to 2008.
<h3>Birth-Cohort Screening</h3>
Persons born between 1945 and 1965 are more likely to be diagnosed with HCV infection, possibly because they received blood transfusions before the introduction of screening in 1992 or have a history of other risk factors for exposure decades earlier. Many persons with chronic HCV infection are unaware of their condition. A risk-based approach may miss detection of a substantial proportion of HCV-infected persons in the birth cohort because of a lack of patient disclosure or knowledge about prior risk status. As a result, 1-time screening for HCV infection in the birth cohort may identify infected patients at earlier stages of disease who could benefit from treatment before developing complications from liver damage.<br /><br />The USPSTF concluded that the benefit of screening for HCV infection in persons in the birth cohort is probably similar to that in persons at higher risk for infection. Birth-cohort screening is probably less efficient than risk-based screening, meaning more persons will need to be screened to identify 1 patient with HCV infection. Nevertheless, the overall number of Americans who will probably benefit from birth-cohort screening is greater than the number who will benefit from risk-based screening.<br /><br />The USPSTF recognizes that increased screening and the resulting increased diagnoses and treatment could result in increased overall harms because not all treated persons will benefit from treatment, including those who will never develop signs or symptoms of disease (overdiagnosis). The USPSTF weighed this potential harm against the potential harm of undertreatment attributable to underdiagnosis. It is hoped that future research will reduce overtreatment by clarifying which persons are most likely to benefit from early diagnosis and treatment. However, given that persons in the birth cohort have been living with HCV infection for 20 or more years, the potential benefit of screening and early treatment will probably be at its highest now and in the near future before becoming smaller. After weighing the competing harms of overtreatment and underdiagnosis, the USPSTF recommends 1-time screening for this cohort.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Anti&ndash;HCV antibody testing followed by polymerase chain reaction testing for viremia is accurate for identifying patients with chronic HCV infection. Various noninvasive tests with good diagnostic accuracy are possible alternatives to liver biopsy for diagnosing fibrosis or cirrhosis.
<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>
Persons in the birth cohort and those who are at risk because of potential exposure before universal blood screening and are not otherwise at increased risk need only be screened once. Persons with continued risk for HCV infection (injection drug users) should be screened periodically. The USPSTF found no evidence about how often screening should occur in persons who continue to be at risk for new HCV infection.
<h3>Screening Implementation</h3>
The USPSTF believes that screening should be voluntary and undertaken only with the patient's knowledge and understanding that HCV testing is planned. Patients should be informed orally or in writing that HCV testing will be performed unless they decline (opt-out screening). The USPSTF further believes that before HCV screening, patients should receive an explanation of HCV infection, how it can (and cannot) be acquired, the meaning of positive and negative test results, and the benefits and harms of treatment. Patients should also be offered the opportunity to ask questions and to decline testing.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
The purpose of antiviral treatment regimens is to prevent long-term health complications of chronic HCV infection (such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma).<br /><br />The combination of pegylated interferon (&alpha;2a or &alpha;2b) and ribavirin is the standard treatment for HCV infection. In 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the protease inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection (the predominant genotype in the United States). Trials have found increased SVR rates in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection who received triple therapy consisting of pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and boceprevir or telaprevir compared with dual therapy consisting of pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Evidence is lacking on the comparative effects of current antiviral treatments on long-term clinical outcomes. Regimens with protease inhibitors are usually of shorter duration than dual therapy (24 or 28 weeks vs. 48 weeks). Triple therapy with protease inhibitors is associated with an increased risk for hematologic events (such as anemia; neutropenia; and thrombocytopenia, particularly with boceprevir) and rash (telaprevir) compared with dual therapy. These adverse events are self-limited and typically resolve after the discontinuation of treatment.
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
As treatment of HCV continues to evolve, more research is needed to understand which persons benefit the most from treatment and when treatment should begin in asymptomatic persons. Research is needed on the outcomes of treatment in screen-detected patients and on treatment decisions guided by &ldquo;noninvasive&rdquo; assessment of cirrhosis and fibrosis because these patients may differ from those enrolled in treatment trials or described in prospective cohort studies. In addition, research should focus on the long-term harms associated with antiviral regimens. Other areas of needed research include frequency of testing in high-risk populations; demonstrating individual or public health benefits from counseling, immunizations, and behavioral changes after an HCV diagnosis in asymptomatic patients; the effect of antiviral treatments on quality of life; and the comparative effectiveness of antiviral treatments in patients with various medical and psychological comorbid conditions.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/hepc/hepcfinalrs.htm#consider,129,"The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American College of Gastroenterology recommend screening in higher-risk patients. The CDC now recommends screening in high-risk patients and age cohort&ndash;based screening for HCV in all persons born between 1945 and 1965. Previous recommendations on screening for hepatitis C by the American Academy of Family Physicians, which is currently updating its recommendations, have been consistent with those of the USPSTF.","Burden of Disease

	Hepatitis C is the most common chronic bloodborne pathogen in the United States. The prevalence of the anti-HCV antibody in the United States is approximately 1.6%1.

	An estimated 78% of persons who test positive for the anti-HCV antibody have detectable levels of HCV in the blood (viremia), reflecting chronic infection. Persons who have HCV and undetectable viremia are considered “cured,” as demonstrated by the absence of serum HCV RNA1.

	The prevalence of chronic HCV infection peaked in 2001 at 3.6 million persons. According to data from 1999 to 2008, three fourths of patients in the United States living with HCV infection were born between 1945 and 1965, with a peak prevalence of 4.3% in persons aged 40 to 49 years. The incidence of HCV infection was more than 200,000 cases per year during the 1980s but decreased to 25,000 cases per year by 2001. In 2009, the CDC estimated that there were 16,000 new cases of HCV infection1, 2.

	Hepatitis C virus infection is the leading cause of complications from chronic liver disease, and HCV-related end-stage liver disease is the most common indication for liver transplants among U.S. adults. It is estimated that the total number of patients with cirrhosis will peak at 1 million in 2020; however, rates of hepatic decompensation and liver cancer are expected to increase for another 10 to 13 years because of the lengthy lag time between infection and development of cirrhosis and other complications. An estimated 15,000 deaths from HCV infection occurred in 20071.

	Scope of Review

	The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality commissioned 2 systematic reviews1, 7 to update the 2004 USPSTF recommendation on screening for and treatment of HCV infection in asymptomatic adults8. These reviews focused on evidence gaps identified in the previous USPSTF recommendation and new studies published since 2004. They also examined the evidence on screening for HCV in pregnant women.

	Accuracy of Screening Tests

	The USPSTF previously found that screening with later-generation enzyme immunoassay and confirmatory recombinant immunoblot assay accurately detects the anti-HCV antibody8. In the current review, the USPSTF considered the evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of various noninvasive confirmatory tests to diagnose cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis in patients with HCV infection1. The USPSTF found more than 100 studies (including 8 of good quality) that compared various noninvasive laboratory-based diagnostic tests with liver biopsy as the reference standard. Sensitivity and specificity varied depending on the cutoff used to define a positive test result. Several of the blood indices were associated with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.75 to 0.86 for fibrosis and 0.80 to 0.91 for cirrhosis (considered good to very good values for diagnostic accuracy)1.

	One study evaluated clinical outcomes associated with different strategies to evaluate patients with HCV infection for treatment. A retrospective cohort study of 156 HCV-positive patients who received interferon and ribavirin therapy found no difference in SVR rates between patients who did not have biopsy before treatment compared with matched patients who did have biopsy (41% vs. 44%; P = 0.87). About three quarters of the patients who did not have biopsy declined the procedure, and about one quarter had contraindications. The study was not designed or powered to evaluate longer-term clinical outcomes and did not report harms associated with biopsy1, 9.

	Clinical practice is moving toward less routine use of biopsy before antiviral treatment. No studies reported current estimates of the proportion of patients who have biopsy before treatment. Although such practice patterns will undoubtedly reduce harms associated with liver biopsy, how this will affect the number of patients considered eligible for treatment and the long-term clinical effectiveness and harms of treatment of these persons is not yet clear.

	Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment

	There is no direct evidence of the benefit of screening for HCV infection in asymptomatic adults in reducing morbidity or mortality. No randomized trials have compared clinical outcomes between persons screened and those not screened for HCV infection.

	Various screening strategies have been proposed; however, no randomized trials or observational studies have compared clinical outcomes of different approaches to screening for HCV. Five studies compared screening approaches to determine the relative yield of the different strategies. Targeted screening strategies in high-risk persons were associated with high sensitivity (>90%) and small numbers needed to screen to identify 1 case of HCV infection (<20 persons). The studies used various criteria for targeted screening, but all included current or past injection drug use, sex with an injection drug user, and receipt of blood transfusion before 1992. Narrow screening strategies (such as those targeting only injection drug use) had low numbers needed to screen but missed up to two thirds of infected patients. None of the studies used the birth-cohort screening approach. The studies were retrospective and had methodological issues that limit the overall ability to compare screening strategies1.

	The USPSTF examined the evidence on benefits from counseling, immunizations, and behavioral changes after a diagnosis of HCV infection. No studies evaluated effects of counseling or immunizations on health outcomes or transmission risk. One randomized trial found that a self-management program in patients with HCV infection was associated with small increases in vitality scores on the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey compared with the use of educational materials after 6 weeks, but there were no effects on other quality-of-life measures10.

	Three retrospective studies showed reduced alcohol use after a diagnosis of HCV infection, but 2 prospective studies found no association between sustainable behavior change (alcohol or injection drug use) and knowledge of diagnosis. Two cross-sectional studies had conflicting results1.

	Evidence is limited on effective counseling methods to decrease high-risk behaviors. Two randomized trials reported mixed results on the effects of behavioral-based counseling interventions compared with simple educational interventions. A before–after study of HCV-infected patients who were heavy drinkers found that a counseling intervention was associated with a greater than 50% reduction in alcohol use1.

	Sustained virologic response is the intermediate outcome used to measure treatment efficacy in clinical trials and is the basis for U.S. Food and Drug Administration drug approval. It is defined as a decrease in HCV RNA to undetectable levels 24 weeks after antiviral treatment and is associated with a sustained loss of detectable viremia.

	Sustained virologic response rate is the principal outcome used to assess the benefit of antiviral regimens because of a lack of direct evidence on long-term clinical outcomes. Two trials of boceprevir and 3 trials of telaprevir with pegylated interferon (α2a or α2b) and ribavirin found that these regimens were more effective in increasing SVR rates than dual therapy with pegylated interferon (α2a or α2b) and ribavirin. Sustained virologic response rates ranged from 60% to 92% (genotype 1) with triple therapy regimens compared with 42% to 52% (genotype 1) with dual therapy7.

	The link between SVR and clinical outcomes has been evaluated in numerous studies. The largest was a cohort study of 16,864 patients from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs that adjusted for several confounders (demographic factors, comorbid conditions, laboratory characteristics, and treatment characteristics). This fair-quality study showed a decrease in the risk for all-cause mortality compared with no SVR across patient groups stratified by genotype. Hazard ratios (HRs) were 0.71 (95% CI, 0.60 to 0.86), 0.62 (95% CI, 0.44 to 0.87), and 0.51 (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.75) for genotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively11. Another recently published cohort study of 530 patients from 5 hospitals in Europe and Canada that adjusted for confounding also found a positive association between SVR and reduced risk for all-cause mortality (HR, 0.26 [95% CI, 0.14 to 0.49]). The study also found reduced risk for liver-related mortality or transplants (HR, 0.06 [95% CI, 0.02 to 0.19]), with a median follow-up of 8.4 years. All patients had advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis12. Eighteen other primarily smaller cohort studies (n = 102 to 2698) found that SVR was associated with decreased risk for all-cause mortality and hepatic complications related to chronic HCV infection, including studies of populations with baseline cirrhosis. The smaller cohort studies had methodological limitations. For example, only 5 studies evaluated important confounders (age, sex, genotype, viral load, and fibrosis); 4 studies reported patients who were excluded or lost to follow-up. In addition, 10 of the 18 studies were conducted in Asia, where the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic HCV infection is higher than in the United States, possibly limiting applicability. Hazard ratios in the 18 cohort studies also indicated an association between achievement of SVR and improvement in clinical outcomes, but these studies reported stronger estimates than the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs cohort study7. A recently published meta-analysis of pooled observational studies13, most of which were included in the USPSTF review, examined the association between SVR and hepatocellular carcinoma. Overall, the review's conclusions on the association between SVR and decreased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma were consistent with the USPSTF review. The pooled adjusted HR estimates for hepatocellular carcinoma were 0.24 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.31) in the general HCV population and 0.23 (95% CI, 0.16 to 0.35) in patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.

	A recent meta-analysis of 8 randomized, controlled trials comparing antiviral therapy (interferon or pegylated interferon, alone or with ribavirin) versus placebo or no intervention showed a reduction in hepatocellular carcinoma (risk ratio, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.34 to 0.81]), with a more pronounced effect in virologic responders than in nonresponders. Although the trials examined older regimens, the USPSTF concluded that the benefits from newer, more effective antiviral regimens may be greater14.

	Antiviral therapy is contraindicated in pregnancy because of its potential teratogenic effects. Although evidence is limited, no labor management intervention has been clearly shown to decrease risk for mother-to-child transmission of HCV infection. Breastfeeding does not seem to be associated with increased risk for mother-to-child transmission1.

	The USPSTF also reviewed a modeling study that informed the CDC's 2012 recommendation on screening for HCV and reported large estimated reductions in HCV-related mortality with a birth-cohort approach versus risk-based screening15. These estimates assumed a lifetime rate of progression to cirrhosis in untreated patients with HCV infection of 54% and a mortality rate from HCV infection of 22%. However, longitudinal studies with up to 20 years of follow-up report cirrhosis in 10% to 20% of HCV-infected patients, and the longest study reported HCV-related mortality in 5.9% of patients after 45 years. In addition, estimates of clinical benefit in the modeling study assumed that risk for cirrhosis and other complications of HCV infection in patients achieving SVR after antiviral therapy reverted to that of uninfected persons5. These assumptions relate to important uncertainties about the natural history of HCV infection. If progression to cirrhosis or mortality was lower than assumed, the benefit from screening and treatment would also be lower. A recent modeling study by Liu and colleagues16 evaluated risk factor–guided and birth-cohort screening strategies. Model assumptions seemed conservative and consistent with available data on the natural history of HCV and effectiveness of antiviral treatment. The study concluded that birth-cohort screening provides nearly twice the benefit of risk-based screening.

	Harms of Screening and Treatment

	Potential harms associated with screening for HCV infection include anxiety, labeling, and effect on relationships, but evidence on these harms is limited. Five studies of patients diagnosed with HCV infection suggest potential negative psychological and social effects, but the sample sizes were small and the studies had methodological flaws, such as lack of an unscreened comparison group1.

	In addition to the potential harms of screening, there are harms related to the diagnostic evaluation of patients who test positive for the anti-HCV antibody. In a study of 2,740 patients with chronic HCV infection and an Ishak fibrosis score of 3 or higher (no uncompensated cirrhosis) who had liver biopsy, serious adverse events occurred in 1.1% of patients, including 0.6% who had serious bleeding and 0.3% who had severe pain7. No deaths were reported. In 5 large intervention series published since 2004, the mortality rate was less than 0.2% and serious complications were found in 0.3% to 1.0% of more than 62,000 patients who had liver biopsy1. Because of the availability of various noninvasive tests that have good diagnostic accuracy, liver biopsy will probably occur less frequently.

	Harms are associated with the medications used to treat HCV. The most common adverse effects of antiviral regimens are fatigue, headache, and other flu-like symptoms, which occurred in as many as one half of patients in some trials. Triple therapy with protease inhibitors was associated with increased risk for hematologic events (anemia; neutropenia; and thrombocytopenia, particularly with boceprevir) and rash (telaprevir) compared with dual therapy. Although treatment-related adverse effects were common, the few serious adverse events reported in the trials were generally self-limited and typically resolved after the discontinuation of treatment7.

	Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit

	The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a linkage between SVR and clinical outcomes (hepatocellular carcinoma and mortality) and that the overall net benefit of screening is moderate. The evidence supporting this linkage includes consistent associations between achieving SVR and improved clinical outcomes, with most studies reporting large effect sizes, as well as evidence from studies that controlled for several confounders and found an early mortality reduction among patients with all viral genotypes who achieved SVR and are probably similar to patients detected and eligible for treatment hrough U.S. screening programs. In addition, evidence showed that antiviral treatment results in improved clinical outcomes. A new modeling study showed that birth-cohort screening provided nearly twice the benefit of risk-based screening.

	Given the decreasing use of liver biopsy before antiviral treatment and evidence that antiviral therapy regimens have small harms, the USPSTF concludes that the net benefit of screening for HCV infection in high-risk populations with a high prevalence (injection drug users) is moderate. Populations at very high risk have a larger overall benefit from screening because of the higher prevalence of infection and greater potential for treatment benefits. Although the birth cohort has a lower prevalence of infection, the small harms of screening are outweighed by the larger benefit of receiving treatment that can prevent liver-related morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of 1-time screening in adults born between 1945 and 1965 is moderate.

	How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?

	Chronic HCV infection is defined by the presence of HCV RNA in the blood for at least 6 months after acute infection. Chronic infection occurs in 78% of infected patients; however, the ability to accurately determine which infected patients will develop cirrhosis and which will not is limited. Many patients with chronic infection do not develop histologic evidence of liver disease or have mild liver disease, whereas others progress to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Cohort studies show that approximately 7% to 24% of persons will develop cirrhosis after 20 years of infection, with possible acceleration of cirrhosis after infection for 20 years, and up to 5% will die of liver-related complications1. Evidence is limited on the longer-term natural history of chronic HCV infection.

	Sustained virologic response is associated with the absence of detectable serum HCV RNA, improved histologic changes, and normalization of liver aminotransferase levels. It is considered to reflect resolution of HCV infection.

	Preparation of the Draft Recommendation Statement

	In July 2012, after deliberation of the evidence, the USPSTF preliminarily voted for a B grade for screening for HCV in high-risk persons and a C grade for the birth cohort. In preparing the draft recommendation statement, the USPSTF considered the quality of evidence obtained from observational data, whether results from the cohort studies reflected a “screened population,” and whether SVR is a sufficient proxy for long-term treatment response. These limitations of the evidence led the USPSTF to conclude with moderate certainty that the magnitude of the net benefit was at least small for the birth cohort. The different recommendations for high-risk versus birth-cohort screening reflected differences in the prevalence of HCV infection in the populations and the USPSTF's certainty about net benefit.

	A draft version of the recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 27 November to 24 December 2012. Since then, new evidence has been published by van der Meer and colleagues12, Morgan and colleagues13, Kimer and colleagues14, and Liu and colleagues16 and reviewed by the USPSTF. The positive association between SVR and mortality (all-cause or liver-related) reported in the cohort study by van der Meer and colleagues strengthened the USPSTF's confidence in the linkage of SVR and clinical outcomes. A meta-analysis of cohort studies by Morgan and colleagues showed findings consistent with those of the USPSTF's evidence review13. Kimer and colleagues provided new evidence that antiviral treatment was associated with better clinical outcomes than placebo or no intervention, and the modeling study by Liu and colleagues showed that birth-cohort screening provided nearly twice the clinical benefit of risk-based screening.

	The USPSTF also considered that risk-based screening does not work well in identifying persons who are at increased risk for HCV infection. The USPSTF recognized that increased screening and diagnoses could lead to increased harms because not all persons will benefit from treatment. The USPSTF assessed the potential harm of overdiagnosis and determined that the harms were small given the reduced use of liver biopsy, the limited duration of antiviral therapy, and the reversibility of adverse effects with discontinuation of therapy and were balanced by the larger benefit of treatment for infected persons in the birth cohort. The new studies provided evidence that the magnitude of the net benefit in the birth cohort is moderate, not small.

	Response to Public Comments

	A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 27 November to 24 December 2012. Some comments requested clarification about risk factors. Others addressed the costs of screening in the birth cohort and how HCV treatment may be inaccessible to persons without health insurance coverage. Many comments noted that risk-based screening would be a burden to clinical providers, is viewed as less effective, and may be a low priority for clinicians who see asymptomatic patients. Many comments disagreed with the USPSTF's assessment of the benefits and harms of screening for HCV in the birth cohort compared with high-risk persons.

	In response to these comments, the USPSTF distinguished between established risk factors and less established risk factors in the Clinical Considerations section and added language about populations that are at risk. The USPSTF does not make recommendations on insurance coverage or assess or consider financial costs. The USPSTF also clarified how risk-based screening approaches may miss infected persons.

	After the public comment period, the USPSTF considered new evidence that was published since its initial deliberation—specifically, studies by Kimer and colleagues14, van der Meer and colleagues12, Liu and colleagues16), and Morgan and colleagues13. After reviewing this new evidence, the USPSTF determined that the new studies support a moderate magnitude of net benefit for the birth cohort as well as for high-risk persons.

"<h3><a name=""consider""></a>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to adults aged 40 years or older without known CVD (including history of MI or stroke) and without increased bleeding risk (for example, history of GI ulcers, recent bleeding, or use of medications that increase bleeding risk).
<h3>Assessment of the Balance of Benefits and Harms</h3>
The magnitude of the health benefits of aspirin use depends on an individual&rsquo;s baseline CVD risk and willingness to take aspirin for a sufficient duration to obtain the benefit of reduced incidence of CRC. The magnitude of harms depends on the presence of risk factors for bleeding.
<h4>Baseline CVD Risk</h4>
The magnitude of the cardiovascular risk reduction with aspirin use depends on an individual&rsquo;s initial risk for CVD events. Risk assessment for CVD should include ascertainment of the following risk factors: age, sex, race/ethnicity, total cholesterol level, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, hypertension treatment, diabetes, and smoking. An online version of the ACC/AHA risk calculator can be found at <a href=""http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator/"" target=""_blank"">http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator/</a><a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/exit-disclaimer"" title=""This link goes offsite.
Click to read the external link disclaimer"" class=""extLink"">This link goes offsite. Click to read the external link disclaimer</a>.
<h4>CRC Prevention</h4>
Colorectal cancer prevention plays an important role in the overall health benefit of aspirin, but this benefit is not apparent until 10 years after aspirin therapy is started. Patients need to take aspirin for at least 5 to 10 years to realize this potential benefit,<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation6"">6</a>, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation7"">7</a> and persons with shorter life expectancy are less likely to benefit. Thus, aspirin use is more likely to have an effect when it is started between the ages of 50 and 59 years. Because of the time required before a reduced incidence in CRC is seen, older persons (that is, 60 years or older) are less likely to realize this benefit than adults aged 50 to 59 years.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation8"">8</a>
<h4>GI and Intracranial Bleeding</h4>
Evidence shows that risk for GI bleeding, with and without aspirin use, increases with age. For this recommendation, the USPSTF considered older age and male sex to be important risk factors for GI bleeding. Other risk factors include upper GI tract pain, GI ulcers, concurrent anticoagulation or NSAID use, and uncontrolled hypertension.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation4"">4</a>, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation5"">5</a> Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy combined with aspirin use increases the risk for serious GI bleeding compared with aspirin use alone.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation9"">9</a> The rate of serious bleeding among aspirin users is about 2 to 3 times greater in patients with a history of GI ulcer.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation10"">10</a> The risk for serious GI bleeding is 2 times greater in men than in women.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation10"">10</a> These risk factors increase the risk for bleeding substantially and should be considered in the overall decision about whether to start or continue aspirin therapy. There is no evidence that enteric-coated or buffered formulations reduce the risk for serious GI bleeding.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation2"">2</a>, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation4"">4</a>, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation11"">11</a>
<h4>Balance of Benefits and Harms</h4>
The USPSTF used a CVD microsimulation model to estimate cardiovascular event rates based on baseline risk factors and aspirin use. It used the AHA/ACC risk calculator to stratify findings of benefits and harms by 10-year CVD risk. The USPSTF also calculated estimates of CRC incidence and harms of bleeding to determine the net balance of benefits and harms across individuals with varying baseline CVD risk.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation8"">8</a>, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation12"">12<br /><br /></a><a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#tab1"">Table 1</a> and <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#tab2"">Table 2</a> present the USPSTF&rsquo;s estimated lifetime number of nonfatal MIs, ischemic strokes, and cases of CRC prevented, stratified by 10-year CVD risk level, age, and sex, among adults aged 50 to 69 years (the age range with evidence of net benefit from aspirin use). In addition, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#tab1"">Table 1</a> and <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#tab2"">Table 2</a> present the USPSTF&rsquo;s estimated lifetime number of GI bleeding events and hemorrhagic strokes. The USPSTF developed these estimates assuming that aspirin users are not taking NSAIDs and do not have other conditions that increase risk for GI bleeding. The USPSTF estimated life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) saved as one part of its consideration of the balance of benefits and harms of these disparate clinical outcomes (see the Implementation section for more information on interpreting the results in <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#tab1"">Table 1</a> and <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#tab2"">Table 2</a>).<br /><br />Overall, the USPSTF determined that the greatest net benefit to be gained is by adults aged 50 to 59 years whose 10-year CVD risk is 10% or greater. The USPSTF recommends that persons in this age and risk group start taking aspirin. Adults aged 60 to 69 years may also benefit from starting aspirin use, although the net benefit is smaller due to the increased risk for GI bleeding and decreased benefit in CRC prevention in this age group.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation8"">8<br /><br /></a>Further, the decision about the level of CVD risk at which the potential benefits outweigh potential harms is an individual one. Some adults may decide that avoiding an MI or a stroke is very important and that having a GI bleeding event is not as significant. They may decide to take aspirin at a lower CVD risk level than those who are more concerned about GI bleeding. Adults who have a high likelihood of benefit with little potential for harm should be encouraged to consider aspirin use. Conversely, adults who have little potential for benefit or are at high risk for GI bleeding should be discouraged from it.
<h3>Treatment and Dosage</h3>
The optimal dose of aspirin to prevent CVD events is not known. Primary prevention trials have demonstrated benefits with various regimens, including doses of 75 and 100 mg per day and 100 and 325 mg every other day. A dose of 75 mg per day seems as effective as higher doses. The risk for GI bleeding may increase with the dosage. A pragmatic approach consistent with the evidence is to prescribe 81 mg per day, which is the most commonly prescribed dose in the United States.<br /><br />Although the optimal timing and frequency of discussions about aspirin therapy are unknown, a reasonable approach may be to assess CVD and bleeding risk factors starting at age 50 years and periodically thereafter, as well as when CVD and bleeding risk factors are first detected or change.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statements</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
Evidence from primary prevention trials on the benefits of initiating aspirin use in adults younger than 50 years is limited. The potential benefit is probably lower than in adults aged 50 to 69 years because the risk for CVD events is lower (only a small percentage of adults younger than 50 years have a 10-year CVD risk &ge;10%).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation8"">8</a>Adults younger than 50 years who have an increased 10-year CVD risk may gain significant benefit from aspirin use; how much benefit is uncertain.Evidence on the benefits and harms of initiating aspirin use in older adults is limited. Many adults aged 70 years or older are at increased risk for CVD because of their age. They have a high incidence of MI and stroke; thus, the potential benefit of aspirin could be substantial.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
The relationship between older age and GI bleeding is well-established; thus, the potential harms for adults older than 70 years are significant. The complexity of risk factors, medication use, and concomitant illness make it difficult to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating aspirin use in this age group. In addition, aspirin use in adults older than 70 years results in smaller reductions in the incidence of CRC compared with younger adults.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
Nearly 40% of U.S. adults older than 50 years use aspirin for the primary or secondary prevention of CVD.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation5"">5</a> A study of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data assessed how common aspirin use is for the primary prevention of CVD and whether physicians recommend it or patients start it on their own. Among patients who were eligible for aspirin therapy and were at increased CHD risk (&gt;10% 10-year risk), about 41% were told by a physician to take aspirin. Among patients aged 65 years or older who were told by a physician to take aspirin, 80% adhered to the recommendation.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation13"">13</a>

The USPSTF has made other recommendations on CVD prevention, including smoking cessation and promoting a healthful diet and physical activity, as well as screening for carotid artery stenosis, CHD, high blood pressure, lipid disorders, obesity, diabetes, and peripheral artery disease. In addition, it has made recommendations on screening for CRC.

Million Hearts (<a href=""http://www.millionhearts.hhs.gov/"" target=""_blank"">www.millionhearts.hhs.gov</a>) is a national initiative to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes by 2017. It aims to prevent heart disease and stroke by improving access to effective care, improving the quality of care for the &ldquo;ABCS&rdquo; (aspirin when appropriate, blood pressure control, cholesterol management, and smoking cessation), focusing clinical attention on the prevention of heart attack and stroke, and activating the public to lead a heart-healthy lifestyle.<br /><br />The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends several intervention strategies to prevent CVD for communities and health care organizations (available at <a href=""http://www.thecommunityguide.org/cvd/"" target=""_blank"">www.thecommunityguide.org/cvd/</a>). For health care systems, it recommends introducing clinical decision-support systems to implement clinical guidelines at the point of care. For insurers and payers, it recommends reducing out-of-pocket costs to patients for medications to control high blood pressure and high cholesterol. For clinicians and health care organizations, it recommends incorporating multidisciplinary team-based care to improve blood pressure control, including patients, primary care providers, and other professionals (such as nurses, pharmacists, dietitians, social workers, and community health workers).",,163,"The AHA and the American Stroke Association<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation34"">34</a> recommend the use of low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular (including but not specific to stroke) prophylaxis in adults whose risk is sufficiently high for the benefits to outweigh the risks associated with treatment; they suggest that a 10-year CVD risk of 6% to 10% is sufficient.<br /><br />The American Diabetes Association suggests low-dose aspirin therapy for primary prevention in patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes who have an increased CVD risk (&gt;10% 10-year CVD risk) and are not at increased risk for bleeding. It does not recommend aspirin therapy in men younger than 50 years or most women younger than 60 years who have low CVD risk because the risk for bleeding outweighs the potential benefits of aspirin treatment.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation35"">35<br /><br /></a>Previous recommendations from the American Academy of Family Physicians about aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD and CRC have been consistent with those of the USPSTF.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation36"">36</a> The American College of Chest Physicians suggests that patients older than 50 years without symptomatic CVD use low-dose aspirin for primary CVD prevention.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation37"">37<br /><br /></a>No organizations recommend aspirin use for the primary prevention of CRC in average-risk adults.

Cardiovascular disease and cancer are the leading causes of death among U.S. adults. Cardiovascular disease, including heart attack and stroke, is responsible for 30% of all deaths in the United States.1 More than 26 million adults have been diagnosed and are living with heart disease. Nearly 8 million adults have a history of MI and 6 million have a history of stroke. The costs of caring for persons with CVD were estimated at $315 billion in 2010.2
Cancer accounts for 1 in 4 deaths in the United States. Colorectal cancer is the third-most common cancer in the United States. In 2014, there were an estimated 137,000 new cases and 50,000 deaths due to CRC.3
Scope of Review
The USPSTF commissioned 3 systematic evidence reviews and a decision-analysis model to develop its recommendation on aspirin use to prevent CVD and cancer. The systematic review on aspirin use to prevent CVD is an update of the 2009 USPSTF review.2, 14 The systematic review on aspirin use to prevent CRC is an update of the 2007 USPSTF review.6, 7 The systematic review on aspirin use to prevent cancer other than CRC is new.4, 7 A review of potential harms was incorporated across all 3 systematic reviews.4, 5 The primary studies of interest for all reviews focused on primary prevention of CVD. Findings from the 3 coordinated systematic reviews were integral to determining the parameters and assumptions used in the decision-analysis model, which was used to estimate net benefit for the recommendation.8, 12
Effectiveness of Risk Assessment and Preventive Medication
The USPSTF used a calculator derived from the 2013 ACC/AHA pooled cohort equations to estimate CVD risk thresholds.3 The USPSTF selected this tool because of its broader focus on CVD outcomes (combining both cerebrovascular and cardiovascular outcomes), its external validation in various U.S. populations, and its reasonable performance in studies. The calculator predicts 10-year risk for a first hard atherosclerotic CVD event, defined as nonfatal MI, CHD death, and fatal or nonfatal stroke. It was derived from participants in 4 community-based cohort studies sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The tool accounts for various CVD outcomes, in contrast to many earlier tools that report only CHD outcomes. In addition, the cohorts from which it was derived allowed for the development of sex- and race-specific equations.
The USPSTF focused its review of the evidence on studies of the primary prevention of CVD. It considered 11 randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the benefits of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events.15-25 Four of these studies were published since the last USPSTF review in 2009.15-17, 25 The trials had a total of 118,445 participants; 3 were conducted exclusively in men and 1 exclusively in women. Participants’ mean ages ranged from 55 to 65 years. Eight trials used an aspirin dose of 100 mg or less daily. Duration of follow-up was between 3 and 10 years.22
Primary prevention trials consistently demonstrated effectiveness of aspirin in preventing nonfatal MI and stroke. Pooled analysis of 8 trials of low-dose aspirin (≤100 mg daily) showed a 17% reduction in nonfatal MI and coronary events (relative risk [RR], 0.83 [95% CI, 0.74 to 0.94]). Pooled analysis of 10 trials using any aspirin dose showed a 22% reduction.
Nonfatal strokes were also reduced when only low-dose aspirin trials were included in the analysis (RR, 0.86 [CI, 0.76 to 0.98]). Few fatal stroke events were reported in trials. Pooling the 11 trials showed a nonsignificant reduction in CVD mortality (RR, 0.94 [CI, 0.86 to 1.03]); results were similar when analysis was restricted to studies of low-dose aspirin.
Reduction in all-cause mortality was not significant in any of the trials reporting it. However, when trial results were pooled, all-cause mortality risk was reduced by 5% in participants taking low-dose aspirin (RR, 0.95 [CI, 0.89 to 1.01]). When trials using any aspirin dose were considered, the reduction was statistically significant (RR, 0.94 [CI, 0.89 to 0.99]).14
Subpopulation analyses evaluated effect modification of aspirin by age, sex, and diabetes status. Analysis supports the likelihood that older age groups have greater MI benefit than younger age groups; however, results were mixed. Evidence was not sufficient to support any sex-specific differences in CVD outcomes.14 This differs from the 2009 analysis, in which sex-specific outcome differences were apparent. This was likely due to the predominance of findings from the Women’s Health Study, with its relatively young and healthy study population. There were also no clear differences in outcomes based on diabetes status.
There is evidence of a potential long-term benefit on CRC mortality. Pooled data from primary and secondary CVD prevention trials with more than 10 years of follow-up suggest that a reduction in long-term cumulative CRC mortality is possible with aspirin use. The mortality benefit did not become apparent until 10 to 20 years after randomization.3 Aspirin dose in these trials ranged from 75 to 1200 mg per day, without clear evidence of a dose-related effect. The USPSTF evaluated 3 applicable primary and secondary CVD prevention trials that reported a 40% reduction in CRC incidence with aspirin use (RR, 0.60 [CI, 0.47 to 0.76]) 10 to 19 years after initiation.22, 26-28 These studies suggest that at least 5 to 10 years of aspirin use is required to achieve this reduction. A previously published individual-patient data meta-analysis of 4 primary and secondary CVD prevention trials showed a similar but smaller reduction in CRC incidence (hazard ratio, 0.76 [CI, 0.63 to 0.94]).29
Although evidence of aspirin’s effect on other types of cancer is evolving, it has not yet been seen in trial results. Total cancer mortality was not significantly reduced across 10 RCTs of primary CVD prevention.4 An analysis of 6 RCTs of primary CVD prevention also showed no reduction in total cancer incidence. Other published reports have demonstrated reductions in total cancer mortality and incidence, but the RCTs included in the analyses differed from those reviewed by the USPSTF (for example, different groupings of studies, not a CVD primary prevention population, or higher doses of aspirin used).4
Potential Harms of Preventive Medication
Using aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD variably increases risk for major GI and intracranial bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke, depending on the patient’s medical history and other factors, such as concurrent medication use.
The USPSTF found only 1 risk prediction tool for bleeding, based on a systematic review of risk estimates and incidence of upper GI bleeding and CHD with low-dose aspirin use.30 The tool presumes a baseline incidence rate of upper GI complications of 1 event per 1000 person-years and is modified for 10-year age ranges starting at age 50 years. The tool uses Framingham sex-specific risk prediction equations for CHD and modifies bleeding risk with use of proton-pump inhibitors or Helicobacter pylori eradication, neither of which has been tested for net benefit as part of a comprehensive prevention regimen. Two retrospective validation studies were conducted, but data were insufficient to support its use for prospective prediction in a clinical setting.
To evaluate the risk for GI bleeding, the most common serious harm of aspirin use, the USPSTF considered 7 of the CVD primary prevention trials previously discussed.15, 17-19, 21-23 These trials reported major GI bleeding events, defined as GI bleeding requiring transfusion or hospitalization or leading to death. Aspirin dose ranged from 50 to 325 mg in all but 1 trial. Duration of use and follow-up ranged from 4 to 10 years. Major GI bleeding increased by 58% in aspirin users (odds ratio [OR], 1.58 [CI, 1.29 to 1.95]). Analyses of trials using the range of aspirin doses showed similar results. When all major primary and secondary CVD prevention trials were pooled (15 studies), the OR increased further to 1.65.4 Cohort studies reported similar bleeding risk with aspirin use.10
Hemorrhagic stroke was a rare event; 15.5% of total strokes reported in the trials were hemorrhagic. Across 9 primary CVD prevention trials, the rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 2.54 strokes per 1000 person-years in aspirin users and 1.95 strokes per 1000 person-years in nonusers. Pooled analyses of low-dose aspirin trials showed an increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke (OR, 1.27 [CI, 0.96 to 1.68]).5 Pooled analyses of 9 trials of any dose showed a significant 33% increase in hemorrhagic stroke (OR, 1.33 [CI, 1.03 to 1.71]).5
Increased harms may result from factors that either increase bleeding risk or enhance the bleeding effect of aspirin. An adjusted individual-patient data meta-analysis found that older age (per decade), male sex, and diabetes increased risk for serious bleeding.31 Smoking and increased blood pressure were also associated with increased major extracranial bleeding. A large cohort study of rates of hospitalization for major bleeding events also suggested that older age, male sex, and diabetes had effects on increasing bleeding risk. Statin and proton-pump inhibitor use may decrease the likelihood of hospitalization from a major bleeding event.10
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF used a microsimulation model to estimate the magnitude of net benefit.8, 12 The model incorporated findings from the 3 systematic reviews to inform its parameters and assumptions. Results were stratified by age decade, sex, and 10-year CVD risk. When combined with primary trial data and meta-analyses, the model provides an additional analytic basis to assess the balance of benefits and harms of aspirin use. In addition to the numbers of nonfatal MIs and ischemic strokes prevented, CRC cases prevented, and serious GI bleeding events caused by aspirin, the USPSTF also considered net life-years and net QALYs gained (or lost) over a lifetime as a result of aspirin use (Table 1 and Table 2).
Initiating aspirin use during ages 50 to 59 years and continuing unless contraindicated by an adverse bleeding event results in the greatest gain in net life-years (range, 219 to 463 life-years in women and 333 to 605 life-years in men) and net QALYs (range, 621 to 833 QALYs in women and 588 to 834 QALYs in men). Initiating aspirin use during ages 60 to 69 years and continuing unless contraindicated by an adverse bleeding event results in smaller gains in net life-years (range, −12 to 48 life-years in women and −20 to 116 life-years in men) and net QALYs (range, 284 to 360 QALYs in women and 180 to 318 QALYs in men). The USPSTF chose the 10% 10-year CVD risk threshold as the point at which the tradeoff of benefits and harms reaches an adequate level of certainty. The benefits for an individual patient may shift above or below the threshold depending on individual risk assessment.
The USPSTF determined with moderate certainty that the net benefit in life-years and QALYs gained from aspirin use is moderate in adults aged 50 to 59 years. Adults aged 60 to 69 years gain fewer net life-years and QALYs because of the increased harms from bleeding that come with older age and the reduced potential for CRC benefits (that is, direct reduction in incidence and indirect reduction in mortality), which require at least 10 years to become apparent. The USPSTF concluded with moderate certainty that the net benefit from aspirin use is small in adults aged 60 to 69 years. In both age groups, persons with higher CVD risk will have a greater net benefit (provided their bleeding risk is not also increased).
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
Aspirin is an NSAID. It is one of the most commonly used drugs and is used mostly to relieve pain. Over the past 30 years, its platelet and clotting effects have become better understood. Its anticlotting effect is useful for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events because it can potentially decrease the accumulation of blood clots that form as the result of reduced blood flow at atherosclerotic plaques, thereby reducing hypoxic damage to heart and brain tissue.32
Aspirin is an irreversible cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor. The COX-1 enzyme is responsible for producing the prostaglandins that protect the gastric mucosa. Inhibition of the COX-1 enzyme leaves the mucosa susceptible to damage and GI bleeding. This negative effect increases at higher doses of aspirin.33
The mechanisms for inhibition of adenoma or CRC development are not yet well-understood. Cyclooxygenase-dependent and -independent pathways have been proposed. Cyclooxygenase-dependent pathways may rely on aspirin’s anti-inflammatory properties to reduce tumorigenesis.3
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 15 September 2015 to 12 October 2015. Many comments requested clarification about initiating and continuing aspirin use, especially for persons in their 60s and 70s. The USPSTF added language throughout the recommendation statement to clarify its focus on initiating aspirin use and enhanced the Implementation section to provide guidance on continuing aspirin use. Several comments asked for clarification on the use of aspirin to prevent CRC in persons who are not at increased CVD risk. The USPSTF clarified that its recommendation is based on the combined benefit of CVD and CRC reduction, and only at 10-year CVD risk levels of 10% or greater is there certainty that the benefits exceed the harms of low-dose aspirin use. Several comments found the tables difficult to interpret or asked to include additional age and risk levels. The USPSTF considered other presentations of the data, but the tables represent the results from the decision-analysis model that are most relevant to its estimation of net benefits. Therefore, the tables only include the age and sex ranges for which the USPSTF found moderate certainty of small or moderate net benefit. More detailed tables can be found in the decision analysis report.8","<h3>Importance</h3>

<h3>Harms of Aspirin Use</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that aspirin use in adults increases the risk for GI bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke. <br /><br /><br />The USPSTF determined that the harms vary but are small in adults aged 59 years or younger and small to moderate in adults aged 60 to 69 years. <br /><br /><br />The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine the harms of aspirin use in adults aged 70 years or older.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>In adults aged 50 to 69 years who are at increased CVD risk, the benefits of aspirin use include prevention of MI and ischemic stroke and, with long-term use, reduced incidence of CRC. Aspirin use may also result in small to moderate harms, including GI bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke.<br /><br />The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the benefit of aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events, combined with the reduced incidence of CRC, outweighs the increased risk for bleeding by a moderate amount in adults aged 50 to 59 years who have a 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater.<br /><br />The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the benefit of aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events, combined with the reduced incidence of CRC, outweighs the increased risk for bleeding by a small amount in adults aged 60 to 69 years who have a 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater.<br /><br />The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on aspirin use in adults younger than 50 years or older than 69 years is insufficient and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.</p>",Preventive Medication for Aspirin Use to Prevent Cardiovascular Disease and Colorectal Cancer,"Aspirin Use to Prevent Cardiovascular Disease and Colorectal Cancer, Preventive Medication, 2016"

"<p><b>Patient Population Under Consideration</b></p>
<p>This recommendation applies to adults 18 years or older. The USPSTF uses the following terms to define categories of increased BMI: &ldquo;overweight&rdquo; is a BMI of 25 to 29.9 and &ldquo;obesity&rdquo; is a BMI of 30 or higher. Obesity can be categorized as class 1 (BMI of 30.0 to 34.9), class 2 (BMI of 35.0 to 39.9), or class 3 (BMI of &ge;40) (see the Table for other USPSTF recommendations related to weight).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Behavioral Counseling Interventions</b></p>
<p>Many of the effective intensive behavioral interventions considered by the USPSTF were designed to help participants achieve or maintain a 5% or greater weight loss through a combination of dietary changes and increased physical activity. The US Food and Drug Administration considers a weight loss of 5% as clinically important.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the intensive behavioral weight loss interventions considered by the USPSTF lasted for 1 to 2 years, and the majority had 12 or more sessions in the first year.1 One-third of the interventions had a &ldquo;core&rdquo; phase (ranging from 3-12 months) followed by a &ldquo;support&rdquo; or &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; phase (ranging from 9-12 months).1 Most behavioral interventions encouraged self-monitoring of weight and provided tools to support weight loss or weight loss maintenance (eg, pedometers, food scales, or exercise videos).1 Similar behavior change techniques and weight loss messages were used across the trials.1 Some trials provided interventions modeled after the Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle intervention for use in a primary care or community setting.1 Study heterogeneity, trial quality, and differences in populations and settings made it difficult to identify the most effective intervention characteristics (eg, number of sessions, in-person vs remote sessions, or group- vs individual-based).1 Benefits may depend on tailoring interventions to social, environmental, and individual factors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interventionists varied across the trials, and interventions included varied interactions with a primary care clinician. Primary care clinician involvement ranged from limited interactions with participants in interventions conducted by other practitioners or individuals (ie, group-based interventions conducted by lifestyle coaches or registered dietitians) to reinforcing intervention messages through brief counseling sessions.1 Few interventions included a primary care clinician as the primary interventionist over 3 to 12 months of individual counseling. In the trials not involving a primary care clinician, the interventionists were highly diverse and included behavioral therapists, psychologists, registered dietitians, exercise physiologists, lifestyle coaches, and other staff. The majority of the trials focused on individual participants, but a few interventions invited family members to participate.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trials used various delivery methods (group, individual, mixed, and technology- or print-based). Group-based interventions ranged from 8 group sessions over 2.5 months to weekly group sessions over 1 year (median, 23 total sessions in the first year). These interventions consisted of classroom-style sessions lasting 1 to 2 hours.1 Within the group-based interventions, some trials offered supplemental support with 1 brief individual counseling session, while other trials provided referral and free access to commercially available group-based weight loss programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the individual-based interventions provided individual counseling sessions, with or without ongoing telephone support.1 The remaining interventions were provided remotely through telephone counseling calls (average time, 15-30 minutes) and web-based self-monitoring and support. The median number of sessions in the first year for individual-based interventions was 12.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mixed interventions included comparatively equal numbers of group- and individual-based counseling sessions, with or without other forms of support (eg, telephone-, print-, or web-based). Most of these interventions took place for more than 1 year and involved more than 12 sessions (median, 23 total sessions in the first year).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among technology-based interventions, intervention components included computer- or web-based intervention modules,1 web-based self-monitoring, mobile phone&ndash;based text messages, smartphone applications, social networking platforms, or DVD learning. Only 1 trial delivered its intervention through print-based tailored materials.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rates of participant adherence were generally high.1 More than two-thirds of study participants completed interventions. In addition, all study participants completed more than two-thirds of the intervention. Participation rates did decline over time.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Behavior-based weight loss maintenance trials were designed to maintain weight loss by continuing dietary changes and physical activity.1 Interventions included group interventions, technology-based individual counseling sessions, or a combination of individual and group counseling. Most weight loss maintenance interventions lasted for 12 to 18 months; the majority of interventions had more than 12 sessions in the first year.1 Intervention components focused on nutrition, physical activity, self-monitoring, identifying barriers, problem solving, peer support, and relapse prevention.1 Participants used tools such as food diaries and pedometers to help maintain weight loss.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interventions that combined pharmacotherapy with behavioral interventions reported greater weight loss and weight loss maintenance over 12 to 18 months compared with behavioral interventions alone.1 However, the participants in the pharmacotherapy trials were required to meet highly selective inclusion criteria, including adherence to taking medications and meeting weight loss goals before enrollment. These trials also had high attrition.1 Therefore, it is unclear how well patients tolerate these medications and whether the findings from these trials are applicable to the general US primary care population. In addition, data were lacking about the maintenance of improvement after discontinuation of pharmacotherapy.1 As a result, the USPSTF encourages clinicians to promote behavioral interventions as the primary focus of effective interventions for weight loss in adults.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Additional Approaches to Prevention</b></p>
<p>The USPSTF has made recommendations on screening for abnormal blood glucose levels and type 2 diabetes,13 screening for high blood pressure,14 statin use in persons at risk for cardiovascular disease,15 counseling for tobacco smoking cessation,16 aspirin use in certain persons for prevention of cardiovascular disease,17 and behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity for cardiovascular disease prevention in adults with and without common risk factors18, 19 (Table). The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen for obesity in children 6 years or older and offer or refer them to a comprehensive, intensive behavioral intervention (B recommendation).20</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Useful Resources</b></p>
<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends multicomponent interventions that use technology-supported coaching or counseling to help adults lose weight and maintain weight loss.21</p>",,201,"<p><b>Other Considerations</b></p>
<p>Research Needs and Gaps</p>
<p>Further research is needed to examine the effects of interventions for obesity on longer-term weight and health outcomes (eg, cardiovascular outcomes), including data on important subpopulations (eg, older adults, racial/ethnic groups, or persons who are overweight). Psychosocial, quality of life, and patient-centered outcomes should continue to be evaluated in future studies. Well-designed pragmatic trials and improved reporting of intervention characteristics to enable evaluation and dissemination of interventions in primary care settings are needed. Future research is needed on factors (eg, genetics or untreated medical or psychological conditions) that may be barriers to weight loss during behavioral interventions. Trials are needed that examine whether interventions that focus on both weight loss and support of persons living with obesity improve patient-centered outcomes. Comparative effectiveness trials would provide more evidence about the components of effective interventions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</b></p>
<p>This recommendation updates the 2012 USPSTF recommendation statement on screening for obesity in adults (B recommendation).33</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Recommendations of Others</b></p>
<p>The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommends screening for obesity in adults with BMI at primary care visits.34 The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and the Obesity Society recommend screening for obesity in adults with BMI and waist circumference.35, 36 The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American College of Endocrinology, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend screening for obesity with BMI and using waist circumference as a supplement in adults with a BMI higher than 35.37, 38 The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends screening for obesity in all adults and offering or referring patients with a BMI of 30 or higher to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions.39</p>",,"<p><b>Importance</b></p>
<p>More than 35% of men and 40% of women in the United States are obese.1, 2 Obesity is associated with health problems such as increased risk for coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, various types of cancer, gallstones, and disability.1, 3-7 Obesity is also associated with an increased risk for death, particularly among adults younger than 65 years.1 The leading causes of death among adults with obesity include ischemic heart disease, type 2 diabetes, respiratory diseases, and cancer (eg, liver, kidney, breast, endometrial, prostate, and colon cancer).1, 3, 8-12</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Benefits of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</b></p>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavior-based weight loss interventions in adults with obesity can lead to clinically significant improvements in weight status and reduced incidence of type 2 diabetes among adults with obesity and elevated plasma glucose levels. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavior-based weight loss maintenance interventions are associated with less weight gain after the cessation of interventions, compared with control groups. The magnitude of these benefits is moderate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Harms of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</b></p>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the harms of intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions (ie, behavior-based weight loss and weight loss maintenance interventions) in adults with obesity as small to none, based on the absence of reported harms in the evidence and the noninvasive nature of the interventions. When direct evidence is limited, absent, or restricted to select populations or clinical scenarios, the USPSTF may place conceptual upper or lower bounds on the magnitude of benefit or harms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>USPSTF Assessment</b></p>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that offering or referring adults with obesity to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions (ie, behavior-based weight loss and weight loss maintenance interventions) has a moderate net benefit.</p>",Behavioral Interventions for Weight Loss to Prevent Obesity-Related Morbidity and Mortality in Adults,"Weight Loss to Prevent Obesity-Related Morbidity and Mortality in Adults, Behavioral Interventions, 2018"

This recommendation does not apply to persons who take long-term medications that may cause secondary osteoporosis (eg, glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibitors, or gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists).</p>

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">In deciding which postmenopausal women younger than 65 years to screen with bone measurement testing, clinicians should first consider factors associated with increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. These include parental history of hip fracture, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and low body weight. In addition, menopausal status in women is also an important consideration because studies demonstrating treatment benefit mainly enrolled postmenopausal women. For postmenopausal women younger than 65 years who have at least 1 risk factor, a reasonable approach to determine who should be screened with bone measurement testing is to use a clinical risk assessment tool.</p>
<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">Several tools are available to assess osteoporosis risk: the Simple Calculated Osteoporosis Risk Estimation (SCORE; Merck), Osteoporosis Risk Assessment Instrument (ORAI), Osteoporosis Index of Risk (OSIRIS), and the Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool (OST). These tools seem to perform similarly and are moderately accurate at predicting osteoporosis. The FRAX tool (University of Sheffield), which assesses a person&rsquo;s 10-year risk of fracture, is also a commonly used tool. The FRAX tool includes questions about previous DXA results but does not require this information to estimate fracture risk. Because the benefits of treatment are greater in persons at higher risk of fracture, one approach is to perform bone measurement testing in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years who have a 10-year FRAX risk of major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) (without DXA) greater than that of a 65-year-old white woman without major risk factors.

Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by loss of bone mass, microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, and decline in bone quality leading to increased bone fragility and risk of fractures.9, 12 The World Health Organization defines osteoporosis as bone density at the hip or spine that is at least 2.5 SDs (ie, T score ≤−2.5) below the mean bone density of a reference population of young healthy women, presumably at peak bone mass.29
In the United States, the estimated prevalence of osteoporosis among the community-dwelling population 50 years and older in 2010 was 10.3% (10.2 million adults), based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data.1 After age 50 years, the prevalence of osteoporosis is greater in women than in men (15.4% vs 4.3%, respectively).1 The prevalence of osteoporosis varies by race/ethnicity and is highest in Mexican American (13.4%) and non-Hispanic white adults (10.2%) and lowest in non-Hispanic black adults (4.9%).1 The prevalence of osteoporosis increases dramatically with age, from 5.1% in adults aged 50 to 59 years to 26.2% in those 80 years and older.1 As the US population ages, it is projected that the number of persons living with osteoporosis will also increase. The number of adults 50 years and older with osteoporosis will increase from 10.2 million in 2010 to an estimated 12.3 million in 2020 and 13.6 million in 2030.1 Based on Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set data, the rate of women aged 65 to 85 years enrolled in Medicare who reported ever having a bone density test increased from 64.4% to 71.3% in 2006 and from 73.8% to 79.3% in 2016.30
In 2005, approximately 2 million osteoporotic fractures occurred in the United States.3 Nearly 40% of persons who experience a fracture are unable to walk independently at 1 year, and 60% require assistance with at least 1 essential activity of daily living.31 Hip fractures account for a large portion of the morbidity and mortality associated with osteoporotic fractures, with 21% to 30% of patients dying within 1 year of a hip fracture.2
Osteoporosis is usually asymptomatic until a fracture occurs; preventing osteoporotic fractures is the main goal of an osteoporosis screening strategy.
Scope of Review
The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review4, 6 to search for updated evidence since the previous review in 2011 and examine newer evidence on screening for and treatment of osteoporotic fractures in men and women. The review also sought evidence on risk assessment tools, screening intervals, and efficacy of screening and treatment in subgroups. The USPSTF defined the screening population as postmenopausal women and older men with no known previous osteoporotic fractures and no known comorbid conditions or medication use associated with secondary osteoporosis. The review excluded adults younger than 40 years as well as adults with no known conditions that may increase their risk of falls.
Accuracy of Screening Tests and Clinical Risk Assessment Tools
DXA
Bone measurement testing with central DXA is the most commonly used and studied method for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Central DXA uses radiation to measure BMD at central bone sites (hip and lumbar spine), which is the established standard for diagnosis of osteoporosis and for guiding decisions about treatment. DXA can also be used at peripheral bone sites (such as the lower forearm and heel) to identify persons with low bone mass; however, most treatment guidelines recommend follow-up with central DXA before initiating treatment for osteoporosis. Screening with peripheral DXA and other imaging techniques may help increase access to screening in geographic locations (eg, rural areas) where machines that perform central DXA may not be available. The USPSTF identified 2 studies (n = 712) that reported on the accuracy of peripheral DXA at the calcaneus to identify osteoporosis; compared with central DXA, the area under the curve (AUC) ranged from 0.67 to 0.80 in women with a mean age of 61 years.4, 32, 33
QUS
Quantitative ultrasound is another imaging technique used at peripheral bone sites (most commonly the calcaneus), and it does not require radiation exposure. Compared with central DXA, the AUC for QUS measured at the calcaneus in women ranged from 0.69 to 0.90, with a pooled estimate of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.72-0.81; 7 studies; n = 1969).4 In men, the AUC ranged from 0.70 to 0.93, with a pooled estimate of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.67-0.94; 3 studies; n = 5142).4 However, QUS does not measure BMD, that is the current diagnostic criteria for osteoporosis. In addition, drug therapy trials for osteoporosis treatment generally use central DXA measurement of BMD as criteria for inclusion of study populations.4, 12 Thus, before QUS results could be routinely used to initiate treatment without any further DXA measurement, a method for converting or adapting QUS results to the DXA scale needs to be developed.
Clinical Risk Assessment Tools
The USPSTF evaluated the accuracy of clinical risk assessment tools to identify risk of osteoporosis. Many of these tools can also be used to calculate risk of future fractures; however, the USPSTF focused on their accuracy to identify osteoporosis because all the treatment studies evaluated by the USPSTF enrolled patients based on bone measurement testing, specifically central DXA measurement of BMD. The most frequently studied tools in women were the ORAI (10 studies; n = 16,780), OSIRIS (5 studies; n = 5649), OST (13 studies; n = 44,323), and SCORE (8 studies; n = 15,362). The pooled AUCs for these tools were all similar and ranged from 0.65 to 0.70. The FRAX tool (without BMD), which has been studied extensively as a clinical risk assessment tool to predict fracture risk, performs similarly in its ability to identify osteoporosis (AUC range, 0.58-0.82; 4 studies; n = 22,141).4 These clinical risk assessment tools could be applied to postmenopausal women younger than 65 years who are at increased risk of osteoporosis to help clinicians determine who should be screened with bone measurement testing. Fewer studies are available that evaluate the performance of these tools specifically in younger women, and 1 study has suggested that FRAX is inferior to OST and SCORE in discriminating women with osteoporosis.34 However, in the studies reviewed by the USPSTF, the range of AUCs of these tools (ORAI, OSIRIS, OST, SCORE, and FRAX) to identify osteoporosis in women younger than 65 years were similar to the pooled AUCs for women of all ages; the AUC from individual studies of clinical risk assessment tools in women younger than 65 years ranged from 0.58 to 0.85.4 Table 2 provides more information on these clinical risk assessment tools and commonly used thresholds to determine risk of osteoporosis.
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment
A single fair-quality controlled study (n = 12,483) evaluated the effect of screening for osteoporosis on fracture rates in postmenopausal women aged 70 to 85 years.4-6 This study reported no significant difference in the primary outcome of any osteoporotic fracture in women screened with FRAX vs women receiving usual care (12.9% vs 13.5%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.94 [95% CI, 0.85-1.03]). There was also no significant difference for incidence of all clinical fractures (15.3% vs 16.0%; HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.86-1.03]) or mortality (8.8% vs 8.4%; HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.93-1.19]). However, the study reported a statistically significant reduction in hip fracture incidence (2.6% vs 3.5%; HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.59-0.89]).4-6
The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on drug therapies for the primary prevention of osteoporotic fractures. The vast majority of studies were conducted in postmenopausal women exclusively; only 2 studies were conducted in men.4 Overall, the USPSTF found that drug therapies are effective in treating osteoporosis and reducing fractures in postmenopausal women.
Bisphosphonates
Bisphosphonates were studied most frequently; the USPSTF identified 7 studies on alendronate, 2 trials on zoledronic acid, 4 trials on risedronate, and 2 trials on etidronate.4 All but 1 study were conducted in postmenopausal women. For women, bisphosphonates were found to significantly reduce vertebral fractures (relative risk [RR], 0.57 [95% CI, 0.41-0.78]; 5 studies; n = 5433) and nonvertebral fractures (RR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.76-0.92]; 8 studies; n = 16,438) but not hip fractures (RR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.44-1.11]; 3 studies; n = 8988).4 However, most studies reporting on hip fractures may have been underpowered to detect a difference in this outcome. In the single study of men (n = 1199), zoledronic acid was found to reduce morphometric vertebral fractures (RR, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.16-0.70]) but not clinical nonvertebral fractures (RR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.21-1.97]).4, 15
Raloxifene
Only 1 study (n = 7705) on raloxifene met inclusion criteria for the review. The study evaluated treatment with raloxifene in postmenopausal women and found a reduction in vertebral fractures (RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.53-0.76]) but not nonvertebral fractures (RR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.81-1.06]).4
Denosumab
The USPSTF identified 4 studies that evaluated denosumab; however, only 1 study was adequately powered to detect a difference in fractures. This study (n = 7868) evaluated treatment with denosumab in women and found a significant reduction in vertebral fractures (RR, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.26-0.41]), nonvertebral fractures (RR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.67-0.95]), and hip fractures (RR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.37-0.97]).4, 35
Parathyroid Hormone
The USPSTF reviewed evidence from 2 trials on parathyroid hormone. One trial (n = 2532) conducted in women found a significant reduction in vertebral fractures (RR, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.14-0.75]) but not nonvertebral fractures (RR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.71-1.33]).4, 36 The other trial, conducted in men, found a nonsignificant reduction in nonvertebral fractures (RR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.11-3.83]) when comparing the FDA-approved dose of 20 μg/d vs placebo (n = 298).4, 16 However, the number of fractures in the study was small and the study was stopped early due to concerns about osteosarcoma found in animal studies.
Estrogen
Although the USPSTF did not identify any studies on estrogen for the primary prevention of fractures that met inclusion criteria, the previous review found that estrogen reduces vertebral fractures based on data from the Women’s Health Initiative trial.12
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
One trial evaluated the effect of screening on anxiety and quality of life and found no difference between screened and unscreened intervention groups.4-6 Additional potential harms of screening for osteoporosis include false-positive test results, which can lead to unnecessary treatment, and false-negative test results. The USPSTF did review several studies that reported on harms of various osteoporosis medications.4, 6 Overall, the USPSTF determined that the potential harms of osteoporosis drug therapies are small.
Bisphosphonates
Similar to the evidence on the benefits of drug therapy for the primary prevention of fractures, the most available evidence on the harms is for bisphosphonates. The USPSTF identified 16 studies on alendronate, 4 studies on zoledronic acid, 6 studies on risedronate, 2 studies on etidronate, and 7 studies on ibandronate that reported on harms. Overall, based on pooled analyses, studies on bisphosphonates showed no increased risk of discontinuation (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.91-1.07]; 20 studies; n = 17,369), serious adverse events (RR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.92-1.04]; 17 studies; n = 11,745), or upper gastrointestinal events (RR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.98-1.05]; 13 studies; n = 20,485).4 Evidence on bisphosphonates and cardiovascular events is more limited and generally shows no significant difference or nonsignificant increases in atrial fibrillation with bisphosphonate therapy. Concerns have been raised about osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical fractures of the femur with bisphosphonate therapy. The USPSTF found only 3 studies that reported on osteonecrosis of the jaw, and none of these studies found any cases.4 The previous review12 noted an FDA case series that reported on osteonecrosis of the jaw with bisphosphonate use in patients with cancer. A more recent systematic review that did not meet inclusion criteria (because it included populations with a previous fracture) found higher incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw with intravenous bisphosphonate use and with longer use. No studies that met inclusion criteria for the current review reported on atypical fractures of the femur, although some studies and systematic reviews that did not meet inclusion criteria (because of wrong study population, study design, or intervention comparator) reported an increase in atypical femur fractures with bisphosphonate use. No studies reported any cases of kidney failure, although the FDA has added a warning label noting that zoledronic acid is contraindicated in certain patients. Three trials that reported on harms of bisphosphonates included men (either combining results for men and women or including men only); results were consistent with those of women for risk of discontinuation, serious adverse events, and upper gastrointestinal events.
Raloxifene
Six trials of raloxifene therapy in women reported on various harms. Pooled analyses showed no increased risk of discontinuation due to adverse events (RR, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.98-1.28]; 6 studies; n = 6438) or increased risk of leg cramps (RR, 1.41 [95% CI, 0.92-2.14]; 3 studies; n = 6000).4 However, analyses found a nonsignificant trend for increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (RR, 2.14 [95% CI, 0.99-4.66]; 3 studies; n = 5839), as well as an increased risk of hot flashes (RR, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.22-1.66]; 5 studies; n = 6249).4 The previous review12 found an increased risk of thromboembolic events with raloxifene (RR, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.15-2.23]).4
Denosumab
Four studies (n = 8663) reported on harms of denosumab therapy in postmenopausal women. Pooled analyses showed no significant increase in discontinuation (RR, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.85-1.52]) or serious adverse events (RR, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.88-1.44]) but found a nonsignificant increase in serious infections (RR, 1.89 [95% CI, 0.61-5.91]).4 Three studies reported higher infection rates in women taking denosumab, and further analysis found a higher rate of cellulitis and erysipelas.4 One study reported no occurrences of osteonecrosis of the jaw.4
Parathyroid Hormone
A single study of parathyroid hormone therapy in women (n = 2532) reported an increased risk of discontinuation (RR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.08-1.40]) and other adverse events, such as nausea and headache (RR, 2.47 [95% CI, 2.02-3.03]).4, 36 whereas a single smaller study in men found no increased risk of discontinuation (RR, 1.94 [95% CI, 0.81-4.69]) or cancer (RR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.2-4.74])4 using the FDA-approved dose of 20 μg/d (n = 298).4, 16
Estrogen
Similar to the evidence on the benefits of estrogen for the primary prevention of fractures, no studies met inclusion criteria for the current review. However, based on findings from the Women’s Health Initiative trial, the previous review found an increased rate of gallbladder events, stroke, and venous thromboembolism with estrogen therapy, and an increased risk of urinary incontinence during 1 year of follow-up.4, 12 Women taking combined estrogen and progestin had an increased risk of invasive breast cancer, coronary heart disease, probable dementia, gallbladder events, stroke, and venous thromboembolism compared with women taking placebo, and an increased risk of urinary incontinence during 1 year of follow-up.4, 12
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF found convincing evidence that bone measurement tests are accurate for detecting osteoporosis and predicting osteoporotic fractures in women and men. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that clinical risk assessment tools are moderately accurate in identifying risk of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures.
The USPSTF found convincing evidence that drug therapies reduce subsequent fracture rates in postmenopausal women. The benefit of treating screen-detected osteoporosis is at least moderate in women 65 years and older and in younger postmenopausal women who have similar fracture risk. The harms of treatment range from no greater than small for bisphosphonates and parathyroid hormone to small to moderate for raloxifene and estrogen. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of screening for osteoporosis in these groups of women is at least moderate. The single study that directly evaluated the effect of screening (with FRAX) on fracture outcomes was generally consistent with this conclusion.
The USPSTF found that the evidence is inadequate to assess the effectiveness of drug therapies in reducing subsequent fracture rates in men without previous fractures. Treatments that have been proven effective in women cannot necessarily be presumed to have similar effectiveness in men, and the direct evidence is too limited to draw definitive conclusions. Thus, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for osteoporosis in men.
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
Low bone density is a risk factor for fractures, especially in older adults. Screening for low BMD and subsequent treatment can result in increased BMD and decrease the risk of subsequent fractures and fracture-related morbidity and mortality. Most evidence supports screening for and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women; the evidence for primary prevention in men is lacking, and future research is needed. It cannot be assumed that the bones of men and women are biologically the same, especially because bone density is affected by differing levels and effects of testosterone and estrogen in men and women. Moreover, rapid bone loss occurs in women due to the loss of estrogen during menopause. Men tend to experience fractures at an older age than women, when risk of comorbid conditions and overall mortality are higher; thus, the net balance of benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of osteoporosis in men is unclear.
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from November 7, 2017, to December 4, 2017. In response to comments, the USPSTF added information on the accuracy of certain clinical risk assessment tools to identify osteoporosis in women younger than 65 years to the Discussion section. In addition, the USPSTF clarified that adults with certain conditions that may increase their risk of falls or those using certain medications (such as aromatase inhibitors) that may increase one’s risk of fractures are excluded from this recommendation. Some comments expressed concern that the USPSTF did not recommend screening for osteoporosis in men. Although the USPSTF agrees that prevention of osteoporotic fractures in men is an important public health issue, there is currently not enough evidence demonstrating that screening for and subsequent treatment of osteoporosis in men prevents primary fractures. Studies that have evaluated screening and treatment in men have focused on populations that are out of scope for this recommendation, such as men with a history of previous fractures or men taking certain medications that may cause secondary osteoporosis. The USPSTF is calling for more research in osteoporosis screening and treatment in men, and clarified why it found the evidence insufficient to make a recommendation for or against screening in men. Last, the USPSTF updated the recommendation to include information from a recent trial that evaluated the direct effect of screening for osteoporosis on the incidence of fractures.","<h3 style=""padding: 1em 0em 0.2em; margin: 0em; color: #222222; font-size: 1.2em; font-style: oblique; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"" align=""left"">Importance</h3>

Of note, trials that evaluated treatment with CPAP or MADs were primarily conducted in referred or sleep clinic patients, not screen-detected patients from primary care settings.</p>

The USPSTF has identified the need for further research on the effect on health outcomes of screening for OSA among asymptomatic persons in the general population, as well as the role of sleepiness in determining health outcomes.

Obstructive sleep apnea is the repeated collapse and obstruction of the upper airway during sleep, which results in reduced airflow (hypopnea) or complete airflow cessation (apnea), oxygen desaturation, and arousals from sleep.6 The severity of OSA can be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe based on the number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour (known as the AHI).1 An AHI of 5 to less than 15 is considered mild, 15 to less than 30 is considered moderate, and 30 or greater is considered severe. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is defined as having an AHI of 5 or greater with evidence of daytime sleepiness.
Reported estimates of OSA prevalence vary based on the study definition of OSA, sampling bias, and year of study publication.10 A 2013 systematic review reported an estimated prevalence of 2% to 14% based on 4 community-based studies,11 while 2 U.S.-based studies conducted in the 1990s reported an estimated prevalence of 10% for mild OSA and 3.8% to 6.5% for moderate or severe OSA.1-3 Obstructive sleep apnea is more common in men than in women (odds ratio, 3.1 [95% CI, 2.5 to 3.8])11 and increases with age through the 60s and 70s and then plateaus.12-14 The prevalence difference between men and women narrows after menopause.2, 3, 14, 15 In both men and women, observational studies have found that the prevalence of OSA progressively increases as BMI increases. Using data from the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, 1 study found that a 10% increase in weight was associated with a 6-fold increase in risk of incident OSA over 4 years of follow-up.7
Patients with severe untreated OSA have an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Based on prospective cohort studies, severe OSA has been found to be associated with a 2-fold increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 2.07 [95% CI, 1.48 to 2.91]) and cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio, 2.9 [95% CI, 1.1 to 7.3] to 5.9 [95% CI, 2.6 to 13.3).1 However, it is unclear whether OSA contributes to this increase in mortality independently, beyond the contributions of age, BMI, and other confounding factors.1 Other adverse outcomes have also been reported with OSA, such as increased risk of motor vehicle and other crashes; cognitive impairment; lost work days, work disability, and impaired work performance; and decreased quality of life.1
Scope of Review
The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review1, 8 to evaluate the evidence on the accuracy, benefits, and potential harms of screening for OSA in asymptomatic adults seen in primary care, including those with unrecognized symptoms. The systematic review also evaluated the evidence on the benefits and harms of treatment of OSA on intermediate outcomes (eg, change in AHI, sleepiness, and blood pressure) and health outcomes (eg, mortality, quality of life, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, and cognitive impairment). The review focused on studies in adults 18 years and older and excluded children, adolescents, and pregnant women.
Accuracy of Screening and Diagnostic Tests
Several screening questionnaires and clinical prediction tools have been developed to identify persons who are at higher risk of OSA. The USPSTF found evidence on 2 tools that have been evaluated in primary care or general populations (vs referral populations): the Berlin Questionnaire and the MVAP tool.1 The Berlin Questionnaire was evaluated in a single cross-sectional study that sampled Norwegian residents from the National Population Register; 16,302 participants completed the questionnaire, and 518 went on to have polysomnography.16 Based on analyses that adjusted for oversampling of high-risk participants, the Berlin Questionnaire had a sensitivity of 37.2% (95% CI, 36.0% to 38.4%) and a specificity of 84.0% (95% CI, 83.2% to 84.7%) when using an AHI cutpoint of 5 or greater. Using an AHI cutpoint of 15 or greater, the Berlin Questionnaire had a sensitivity of 43.0% (95% CI, 41.2% to 44.8%) and a specificity of 79.7% (95% CI, 79.0% to 80.5%).1, 16 Overall, the study found poor accuracy. In addition, this single study has not been externally validated and was found to have moderate risk of bias due to missing data, attrition bias, and spectrum bias.
Two studies evaluated the MVAP tool in community or primary care settings. Although both studies were published by the same research group, one study was conducted in Medicare patients with daytime sleepiness (n=452),17 while the other was conducted in patients with hypertension (n=250) visiting internal medicine practices (US Department of Veterans Affairs medical center system and a university-based hypertension clinic).18 Among the Medicare patients with daytime sleepiness, the MVAP tool had a sensitivity of 90.9% and a specificity of 64.4% to predict severe OSAS (defined in the study as an AHI ≥30 and ESS score >10).17 Among patients with hypertension, the MVAP tool had a sensitivity of 91.5% and a specificity of 43.9% to predict severe OSAS.18 When unattended, in-home portable sleep monitor testing was added, the sensitivity of the MVAP tool to predict severe OSAS increased to 90.9% and specificity increased to 75.7%;17 in the study of Medicare patients, while sensitivity decreased to 88.2%, specificity increased to 71.6% among patients with hypertension.18 The 2 studies that evaluated the MVAP tool were conducted in populations that had a high prevalence of OSAS (and thus were more likely to be symptomatic) and a high risk of spectrum bias (ie, the study population does not represent the general primary care population).
The USPSTF also evaluated the evidence on the accuracy of diagnostic tests for OSA. In particular, it evaluated the evidence on the various types of portable sleep monitors compared with polysomnography. Evidence was obtained from 2 systematic reviews and 19 additional studies.1 Most studies evaluated type III and type IV portable monitors. The USPSTF reviewed evidence from 3 studies (n=160) on type II portable monitors, 21 studies (n=1691) on type III portable monitors, and 84 studies (n=8773) on type IV portable monitors.1 None of the studies were conducted in screen-detected populations, and most were conducted in referral populations being evaluated for suspected OSA. Studies were conducted in a variety of settings (home or laboratory) and used a variety of AHI cutpoints, which were not always well reported.1 The overall quality of evidence on type II and type IV portable monitors was found to be fair, while the overall quality of evidence on type III portable monitors was found to be good. A broad range of sensitivity and specificity was reported across multiple AHI cutpoints. Generally, studies on type II and type III portable monitors reported moderate to high sensitivity and specificity, whereas sensitivity and specificity of type IV portable monitors was highly variable and inconsistent (more information is available in Table 5 of the full evidence report1). Overall, consistent with findings from other systematic reviews, type III and type IV portable monitors seem to be generally accurate in diagnosing OSA but have a wide and variable bias in estimating actual AHI6, 19 in patients being evaluated for suspected OSA. It is unclear how these portable sleep monitors would perform in asymptomatic, screen-detected persons.
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment
The USPSTF found no studies that directly evaluated the effect of screening for OSA on health outcomes, such as mortality, quality of life, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. The USPSTF did identify and review studies on the effect of treatment on intermediate outcomes (eg, AHI, ESS score, and blood pressure) and health outcomes (eg, mortality, quality of life, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events).
The USPSTF reviewed evidence from 76 good- to fair-quality treatment trials that described the effect of various interventions on intermediate outcomes, including AHI, ESS score, and blood pressure.1 The most evidence was available on CPAP and found that compared with sham intervention, CPAP reduced AHI (weighted mean difference [WMD], -33.8 [95% CI, -42.0 to -25.6]; 13 studies; n=543), ESS score (WMD, -2.0 [95% CI, -2.6 to -1.4]; 22 studies; n=2721), and blood pressure (diurnal systolic blood pressure WMD, -2.4 [95% CI, -3.9 to -0.9] and diurnal diastolic blood pressure WMD, -1.3 [95% CI, -2.2 to -0.4]; 15 studies; n=1190).1 Less evidence was available on the effect of treatment with MADs on intermediate outcomes. Meta-analysis found that compared with sham intervention, MADs reduced AHI (WMD, -12.6 [95% CI, -15.5 to -9.7]; 6 studies; n=307) and ESS score (WMD, -1.5 [95% CI, -2.8 to -0.2]; 5 studies; n=267) but not blood pressure. Five studies evaluated treatment with upper airway surgery; each evaluated a different surgical technique. Findings on AHI were inconsistent, and no statistically significant improvements in ESS score or blood pressure were found. Although studies generally showed that treatment with CPAP reduced AHI to near-normal levels, treatment with MADs resulted in more modest reductions, and the clinical significance of the small reductions in ESS score is uncertain. Small reductions in blood pressure are associated with cardiovascular disease benefits at the population level, but no evidence of this benefit was seen in these studies. Further, given that most of the trials were conducted in referred or sleep clinic patients, the applicability of this evidence to a screen-detected population is limited.
The USPSTF reviewed evidence from 50 fair- to good-quality trials that evaluated the effect of various treatments or interventions on health outcomes.1 The most evidence was available on CPAP; however, the USPSTF found the evidence on most outcomes to be inadequate because of short length of follow-up and underpowered studies (ie, too few events observed). Thirty-one trials (n=2673) reported on the effect of treatment with CPAP on mortality; most trials (29/31) followed up participants for only 12 weeks or less, and most trials (27/31) reported no deaths in either study group.1 Twelve trials reported on cognitive function; however, they used heterogeneous outcome measures, which made comparison difficult, and results were generally inconsistent. Five trials (n=1529) reported on incidence of myocardial infarction. Most trials (4/5) followed up participants for less than 1 year, and when combined, only reported 1 death (in the control group). Few trials reported on motor vehicle crashes, cerebrovascular events, or heart failure.1 Evidence was available on general and sleep-related quality of life, and there were small but statistically significant improvements in sleep-related quality-of-life scores, but the clinical significance of these improvements is unclear. Importantly, given the characteristics of included study participants (who were from sleep clinics or referral populations, were largely symptomatic, and had daytime sleepiness and more severe OSA), the applicability of this evidence to an asymptomatic, screen-detected population is questionable. Few studies reported on the effect of treatment with MADs (6 studies; n=510) or upper airway surgery (4 studies; n=187) on any health outcomes.
Despite the consistent observational findings of an association between severe OSA and increased mortality, the USPSTF identified no studies that reported on change in AHI and associated change in mortality. Thus, it is unclear whether treatments that improve AHI would also improve mortality.
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
The USPSTF identified no studies that directly evaluated the harms of screening for OSA. A subset of studies that evaluated the effectiveness of various OSA treatments also reported on harms of treatment. Nine studies (n=1759) reported on harms of treatment with CPAP. Follow-up in these studies was generally from 8 to 12 weeks, and most participants were men, with a mean age range of 42 to 61 years, who were overweight or obese (mean BMI, 27 to 39 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]). Overall, 2% to 47% of trial participants reported any adverse effects from treatment with CPAP, including oral or nasal dryness, eye or skin irritation, rash, epistaxis, and pain.1 Eight trials (n=443) reported on harms of treatment with MADs. Follow-up in these studies was generally from 4 to 6 weeks. In 7 trials, 17% to 74% of participants reported oral mucosal, dental, or jaw symptoms, compared with 0% to 17% of participants in comparator groups. In 4 studies, 5% to 33% of participants reported oral dryness, compared with 0% to 3% in control groups, and in 3 studies, 23% to 68% of participants reported excessive salivation, compared with 0% to 3% in comparator groups.1 Four trials (n=205) reported harms of treatment with upper airway surgery; 1% to 81% of participants reported any harms, which included pain, postoperative bleeding, difficulty speaking and swallowing, change in vocal quality, hematomas, ulcerations, infections, and temporary nasal regurgitation.1
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
Overall, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence on screening for OSA in asymptomatic adults or adults with unrecognized symptoms. No studies directly evaluated the benefits or harms of screening for OSA. Few studies evaluated the accuracy of specific screening tools to identify persons at high risk for OSA who could benefit from further testing. Although numerous studies evaluated the effectiveness of treatment with CPAP or MADs to improve intermediate outcomes (eg, AHI, ESS score, or blood pressure) in patients already receiving care or referred for care at a sleep clinic, the clinical significance of these changes and the applicability of this evidence to asymptomatic, screen-detected populations are unclear. Further, evidence is insufficient to determine whether treatment of screen-detected, asymptomatic or unrecognized OSA improves final health outcomes (eg, mortality or cardiovascular events) or whether improving intermediate outcomes (eg, AHI or ESS score) would improve these final health outcomes. Studies that evaluated the effect of treatment with CPAP or MADs on mortality were either underpowered or of too short duration to detect a difference between treated and untreated groups, and no studies reported on whether change in AHI or ESS score affects mortality. Fewer studies reported on the harms of treatment. Overall, the USPSTF was unable to determine the magnitude of the benefits or harms of screening for OSA or whether there is a net benefit or harm to screening in asymptomatic adults or adults with unrecognized symptoms.
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
According to observational studies, severe untreated OSA has been found to be associated with an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.1 Other adverse outcomes that have been reported include increased risk of motor vehicle and other crashes; cognitive impairment; lost work days, work disability, and impaired work performance; and decreased quality of life.1 However, it is unclear what role OSA plays in causing these adverse outcomes, independent from other associated factors such as obesity, older age, hypertension, and general lifestyle. One hypothesis is that OSA leads to chronic disturbances in gas exchange, sympathetic nervous system arousal, and fragmented sleep.1, 6
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from June 14 to July 11, 2016. Some comments expressed concern that the definition of ""asymptomatic"" is unclear, did not agree that an asymptomatic population is the same as persons with unrecognized symptoms, or expressed concern that many symptomatic patients do not report symptoms to their health care professional. The USPSTF discussed its definitional approach extensively when creating the research plan. In the research plan, the USPSTF established that persons without symptoms or with unrecognized symptoms are the population of interest in which to identify potentially unrecognized OSA. In response to comments, the USPSTF described common symptoms of OSA and defined what is meant by persons with unrecognized symptoms. Other comments suggested that a number of key studies were omitted that link OSA treatment to improved health outcomes. The USPSTF examined these studies and found they were either already included in the review, did not meet eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review, or were otherwise outside the scope of the review. A few comments suggested that persons who work in safety-sensitive transportation occupations (eg, truck drivers or rail operators) have unique testing needs. Clinicians seeking information on testing persons who work in these occupations can consult the appropriate agency’s guidelines. The US Department of Transportation recently sought public input related to the evaluation of moderate to severe OSA among persons with these occupations.19","<div class=""podBody"" style=""padding: 0.5em 0.2em 0.5em 0.5em; margin: 0em; box-shadow: #888888 0px 2px 2px inset; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; border: 1px solid #696969;"">

"<h2>Clinical Considerations</h2>
<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adolescent or adult males. The USPSTF did not review the evidence for screening males with a history of cryptorchidism.</p>
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
<p>The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of testicular examination in asymptomatic patients are unknown. Screening examinations performed by patients or clinicians are unlikely to provide meaningful health benefits because of the low incidence and high survival rate of testicular cancer, even when it is detected at symptomatic stages.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Management of testicular cancer consists of orchiectomy and may include other surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, depending on the disease stage and tumor type. Regardless of disease stage, more than 90% of all newly diagnosed cases of testicular cancer will be cured.</p>
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
<p>The National Cancer Institute's Physician Data Query, available at <a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq"">www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq</a>, is a comprehensive database that contains summaries on a wide range of cancer-related topics for health professionals and patients, including testicular cancer screening and treatment.</p>",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf10/testicular/testicuprs.htm#clinical,110,"<h3>Recommendations of Others</h3>
<p>The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends against routine screening for testicular cancer in asymptomatic adolescent and adult males. The American Academy of Pediatrics does not include screening for testicular cancer in its recommendations for preventive health care. Finally, the American Cancer Society does not recommend testicular self-examination.</p>",,"<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Testicular cancer (a primary germ-cell tumor of the testis) is the most common cancer among males aged 15 to 34 years. However, with an annual incidence rate of 5.4 cases per 100,000 males, testicular cancer is relatively rare compared with other types of cancer.</p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>Most cases of testicular cancer are discovered accidentally by patients or their partners. There is inadequate evidence that screening by clinician examination or patient self-examination has a higher yield or greater accuracy for detecting testicular cancer at earlier (and more curable) stages.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Detection and Early Intervention</h3>
<p>Based on the low incidence of this condition and favorable outcomes of treatment, even in cases of advanced disease, there is adequate evidence that the benefits of screening for testicular cancer are small to none.</p>
<h3>Harms of Detection and Early Intervention</h3>
<p>Potential harms associated with screening for testicular cancer include false-positive results, anxiety, and harms from diagnostic tests or procedures. The USPSTF found no new evidence on potential harms of screening and concluded that these harms are no greater than small.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes that there is moderate certainty that screening for testicular cancer has no net benefit.</p>",Testicular Cancer ,"Testicluar Cancer, Screening, 2011"
"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
The risk for lung cancer increases with age and cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke and decreases with time since quitting smoking. The best evidence for the benefit of screening comes from the NLST, which enrolled adults aged 55 to 74 years who had at least a 30 pack-year smoking history and were current smokers or had quit within the past 15 years. As with all screening trials, the NLST tested a specific intervention over a finite period. Because initial eligibility extended through age 74 years and participants received 3 annual screening computed tomographic scans, the oldest participants in the trial were aged 77 years. <br /><br />The USPSTF used modeling studies to predict the benefits and harms of screening programs that use different screening intervals, age ranges, smoking histories, and times since quitting. A program that annually screens adults aged 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years is projected to have a reasonable balance of benefits and harms. The model assumes that persons who achieve 15 years of smoking cessation during the screening program discontinue screening. This model predicts the outcomes of continuing the screening program used in the NLST through age 80 years. <br /><br />Screening may not be appropriate for patients with substantial comorbid conditions, particularly those who are in the upper end of the screening age range. The NLST excluded persons who were unlikely to complete curative lung cancer surgery and those with medical conditions that posed a substantial risk for death during the 8-year trial. The baseline characteristics of the NLST showed a relatively healthy sample, and fewer than 10% of enrolled participants were older than 70 years. Persons with serious comorbid conditions may experience net harm, no net benefit, or at least substantially less net benefit. Similarly, persons who are unwilling to have curative lung surgery are unlikely to benefit from a screening program.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
Age, total exposure to tobacco smoke, and years since quitting smoking are important risk factors for lung cancer and were used to determine eligibility in the NLST. Other risk factors include specific occupational exposures, radon exposure, family history, and history of pulmonary fibrosis or chronic obstructive lung disease. The incidence of lung cancer is relatively low in persons younger than 50 years but increases with age, especially after age 60 years. In current and former smokers, age-specific incidence rates increase with age and cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke.<br /><br />Smoking cessation substantially reduces a person's risk for developing and dying of lung cancer. Among persons enrolled in the NLST, those who were at highest risk because of additional risk factors or a greater cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke experienced most of the benefit. A validated multivariate model showed that persons in the highest 60% of risk accounted for 88% of all deaths preventable by screening.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Low-dose computed tomography has shown high sensitivity and acceptable specificity for the detection of lung cancer in high-risk persons. Chest radiography and sputum cytologic evaluation have not shown adequate sensitivity or specificity as screening tests. Therefore, LDCT is currently the only recommended screening test for lung cancer.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
Surgical resection is the current standard of care for localized NSCLC. This type of cancer is treated with surgical resection when possible and also with radiation and chemotherapy. Annual LDCT screening may not be useful for patients with life-limiting comorbid conditions or poor functional status who may not be candidates for surgery.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
Smoking cessation is the most important intervention to prevent NSCLC. Advising smokers to stop smoking and preventing nonsmokers from being exposed to tobacco smoke are the most effective ways to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with lung cancer. Current smokers should be informed of their continuing risk for lung cancer and offered cessation treatments. Screening with LDCT should be viewed as an adjunct to tobacco cessation interventions.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
Clinicians have many resources to help patients stop smoking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has developed a Web site with many such resources, including information on tobacco quit lines, available in several languages (<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips"">www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips</a>). Quit lines provide telephone-based behavioral counseling and support to tobacco users who want to quit smoking. Counseling is provided by trained cessation specialists who follow standardized protocols that may include several sessions and are generally provided at no cost to users. The content has been adapted for specific populations and can be tailored for individual clients. Strong evidence shows that quit lines can expand the use of evidence-based tobacco cessation treatments in populations that may have limited access to treatment options. <br /><br />Combination therapy with counseling and medications is more effective at increasing cessation rates than either component alone. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved several forms of nicotine replacement therapy (gum, lozenge, transdermal patch, inhaler, and nasal spray), as well as bupropion and varenicline. More information on the treatment of tobacco dependence can be found in the U.S. Public Health Service Reference Guide &ldquo;Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence: 2008 Update&rdquo; (available at <a href=""http://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/clinicians-providers/guidelines-recommendations/tobacco/clinicians/reference/tobaqrg.pdf"">www.ahrq.gov/professionals/clinicians-providers/guidelines-recommendations/tobacco/clinicians/reference/tobaqrg.pdf</a>). The National Cancer Institute has developed a patient and physician guide for shared decision making for lung cancer screening based on the NLST (available at <a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/qa/2002/NLSTstudyGuidePatientsPhysicians"">www.cancer.gov/newscenter/qa/2002/NLSTstudyGuidePatientsPhysicians</a>). This 1-page resource may be a useful communication tool for providers and patients. <br /><br />In addition, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network has developed guidelines for the follow-up of lung nodules. The appropriate follow-up and management of abnormalities found on LDCT scans are important given the high rates of false-positive results and the potential for harms. Lung cancer screening with LDCT should be implemented as part of a program of care, as outlined in the next section.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/lungcan/lungcanfinalrs.htm#consider,137,"In 2012, the American College of Chest Physicians, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the American Thoracic Society recommended screening for lung cancer with LDCT primarily on the basis of results from the NLST, using eligibility criteria that closely modeled those of the NLST (persons aged 55 to 74 years who have a &ge;30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit in the past 15 years). The recommendations also stipulated that screening should be offered only in clinical settings similar to those in the trial. <br /><br />The American Association for Thoracic Surgery&nbsp;recommends annual screening with LDCT in current and former smokers aged 55 to 79 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history. It also recommends annual screening starting at age 50 to 79 years in patients who have a 20 pack-year smoking history and additional comorbid conditions that produce a cumulative risk for cancer of at least 5% over the next 5 years. Furthermore, it recommends annual screening in long-term cancer survivors aged 55 to 79 years. <br /><br />In 2013, the American Cancer Society&nbsp;also began recommending screening for lung cancer with LDCT in high-risk patients who are in relatively good health and meet the NLST criteria (persons aged 55 to 74 years who have a &ge;30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit in the past 15 years). It recommends against the use of chest radiography and strongly suggests that all adults who receive screening enter an organized screening program that has experience in LDCT. <br /><br />In addition, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network&nbsp;recommends LDCT screening in selected patients who are at high risk for lung cancer. High risk is defined as persons aged 55 to 74 years who have at least a 30 pack-year smoking history and, if a former smoker, 15 years or less since quitting or persons aged 50 years or older who have at least a 20 pack-year smoking history and 1 additional risk factor. It does not recommend lung cancer screening in persons who are at moderate risk (aged &ge;50 years and &ge;20 pack-year smoking history or secondhand smoke exposure but no additional lung cancer risk factors) or low risk (younger than 50 years or smoking history of &lt;20 pack-years).","Burden of Disease

	Lung cancer is the third most common cancer in the United States. Age-adjusted incidence rates per 100,000 persons are higher in men and vary according to the duration of and exposure to tobacco smoke. The most important risk factor for lung cancer is smoking, which results in approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases in the United States. Although the prevalence of smoking has decreased, approximately 37% of U.S. adults are current or former smokers. In 2008, an estimated 7 million U.S. adults aged 55 to 75 years had a 30 pack-year or more smoking history2.

	The incidence of lung cancer increases with age, occurring most commonly in adults aged 55 years or older. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, accounting for approximately 28% of all deaths from cancer. Death from lung cancer is often related to the initial stage of diagnosis. The average 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is among the lowest (17%) of all types of cancer but is higher when the disease is diagnosed at an early stage (52%). However, only 15% of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at such a stage2.

	Scope of Review

	To update the 2004 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to assess the efficacy of LDCT, chest radiography, and sputum cytologic evaluation for lung cancer screening in asymptomatic persons who are at average or high risk for lung cancer (current or former smokers) 3. The review focused on new evidence from RCTs to determine the effectiveness of these screening tests in improving health outcomes. Information about the harms associated with these screening tests was obtained from RCTs and cohort studies. The benefits and harms associated with surgical resection of early-stage NSCLC were also examined.

	In addition to the evidence review, the USPSTF commissioned modeling studies from the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) to provide information about the optimum age at which to begin and end screening, the optimum screening interval, and the relative benefits and harms of different screening strategies 9,  10. The modeling studies complement the evidence that the systematic review provides.

	Accuracy of Screening Tests

	The sensitivity of chest radiography for detecting lung cancer varies depending on the size and location of the lesion, image quality of the scan, and skill of the radiologist who interprets the scan. Low-dose computed tomography has emerged as a test with higher sensitivity and specificity for lung cancer than chest radiography. In 2004, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence to recommend for or against screening for lung cancer with LDCT, chest radiography, sputum cytologic evaluation, or a combination of these tests (I statement). Since then, many RCTs have been done and published, resulting in more data on the benefits and harms of screening. Recent data from the NLST showed a sensitivity of 93.8% and specificity of 73.4% for LDCT and a sensitivity of 73.5% and specificity of 91.3% for chest radiography11. Sputum cytologic evaluation is now rarely used for lung cancer screening, and no studies reported on the test characteristics of this screening method.

	Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment

	Four RCTs reported the effectiveness of LDCT for lung cancer screening. The largest trial, the NLST, showed a reduction in lung cancer mortality of 16% (95% CI, 5.0% to 25.0%)12 and a reduction in all-cause mortality of 6.7% (95% CI, 1.2% to 13.6%)4. This trial included more than 50,000 asymptomatic adults aged 55 to 74 years who had at least a 30 pack-year smoking history.

	Participants were current or former smokers and were randomly assigned to LDCT or chest radiography. They received annual testing at baseline and years 1 and 2 and were followed for a median of 6.5 years. After 6 to 7 years of follow-up, 2.06% of patients in the chest radiography group and 1.75% of those in the LDCT group had died of lung cancer, for an absolute difference of 0.31% and a number needed to screen of about 3204. The number needed to screen is based on 3 annual screenings; screening the same sample over a longer period will result in a much lower estimate.

	In contrast to the NLST, 3 small European trials showed potential harm or no benefit of screening. Two small fair-quality trials, the DANTE (Detection and Screening of Early Lung Cancer by Novel Imaging Technology and Molecular Essays) trial and the DLCST (Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial), showed no benefit associated with LDCT compared with no LDCT13–15. However, these were smaller trials (n = 2472 and 4104, respectively) that may have had limited power to detect a true benefit.

	Of note, the inclusion criteria in the DLCST resulted in younger and healthier participants than in other trials. The relative risk for all-cause mortality in the DLCST was 1.46 (95% CI, 0.99 to 2.15). This finding raises the possibility of potential harm of screening a young, healthy population. Follow-up in the DLCST was 4.7 years15. Combined data from the DLCST and the NELSON (Dutch–Belgian Randomised Lung Cancer Screening) trial will be reported soon2.

	When these 3 fair- or good-quality trials were combined in a meta-analysis, the relative risk for lung cancer mortality was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.91) 2. Another European trial, the MILD (Multicentric Italian Lung Detection) study, was rated as poor quality because of concerns about the adequacy of randomization; its results were not included in the final meta-analysis16.

	Two fair- to good-quality trials found no benefits associated with chest radiography screening2. The larger of these trials, the PLCO (Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian) Cancer Screening Trial, evaluated more than 150,000 participants from the general population and found no benefits of this type of screening in this group or in a subgroup that had tobacco smoke exposure17.

	Smaller RCTs from Europe had different eligibility criteria and have not yet duplicated the findings of the NLST; therefore, only moderate certainty exists about the magnitude of benefit from screening3. As with all screening trials, these studies were done over a limited time frame, with the NLST evaluating the effect of 3 annual screenings. Modeling is required to estimate the effect of screening beyond that evaluated in a clinical trial. Estimates of the results of different screening intervals, ages at which to start and stop screening, and thresholds for smoking history come from modeling studies that CISNET conducted for the USPSTF.

	Annual screening with LDCT provides the greatest benefit in decreasing lung cancer mortality compared with biennial or triennial screening9,  10. The Table shows the results of annual screening strategies between the ages of 55 and 80 years that had a better balance of benefits and harms than other strategies in this age range. Focusing screening efforts on the highest-risk persons, those with at least a 40 pack-year smoking history, results in the lowest number of screening scans per death averted and, therefore, the least harm to patients in terms of risk for overdiagnosis and consequences of false-positive results.

	Screening progressively larger proportions of the population by lowering the screening threshold increases the number of deaths averted but with a progressively higher number of screening scans per death averted, therefore increasing harm. The Table shows that increasing the proportion of the population screened from 13% to 36% increases the number of deaths averted by 75% but increases the number of screening scans by 327%, greatly increasing the probability of an untoward event after the evaluation of a false-positive result and the number of radiation-induced cancer deaths. The highlighted program—screening current or former smokers aged 55 to 80 years who have at least a 30 pack-year smoking history and discontinuing (or not starting) screening after 15 years of smoking abstinence—most closely resembles the strategy applied to participants in the NLST and offers a reasonable balance of benefits and harms.

	The CISNET modeling studies show similar life-years gained per death averted and proportion of cancer cases detected at an early stage across the screening strategies. The modeling studies estimate that 9.5% to 11.9% of screen-detected cancer cases are overdiagnosed—that is, they would not have been detected in the patient's lifetime without screening9,  10.

§ Percentage of screen-detected cancer that is overdiagnosis; that is, cancer that would not have been diagnosed in the patient's lifetime without screening.

	Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment

	Harms associated with LDCT screening include false-negative and false-positive results, incidental findings, overdiagnosis, radiation exposure, and psychological distress. The sensitivity of LDCT ranged from 80% to 100%, suggesting a false-negative rate of 0% to 20%. The specificity of LDCT ranged from 28% to 100%.

	The positive predictive value for lung cancer of an abnormal test result ranged from 2% to 42% . As mentioned previously, the NLST is the largest trial of lung cancer screening to date, and recent results showed a sensitivity of 93.8% and specificity of 73.4% for LDCT. In the NLST, the positive predictive value for a positive finding of a pulmonary nodule measuring 4 mm or larger was 3.8%11.

	Over the 3 rounds of screening in the NLST, 24.2% of screening test results were positive; 96.4% of these were false-positives. Most positive test results were followed by additional imaging. Approximately 2.5% of positive test results required additional invasive diagnostic procedures, such as bronchoscopy, needle biopsy, or thoracoscopy. Of the 17,053 positive test results evaluated, there were approximately 61 complications and 6 deaths after a diagnostic procedure. Recently published data from the first round of screening in the NLST showed an average of 1 follow-up scan per positive screening test result. Approximately 1.9% of NLST participants had a biopsy 11.

	The most common incidental findings on LDCT were emphysema and coronary artery calcifications. Other pulmonary findings included bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, carcinoid tumors, and hamartomas. The NLST reported 7.5% clinically significant LDCT abnormalities that were not lung cancer. None of the studies reported data on the evaluations that may have occurred in response to the incidental findings. Therefore, the harms and benefits associated with incidental findings cannot currently be determined2.

	Overdiagnosis was not formally reported in any study. The NLST found 119 more lung cancer cases in approximately 26,000 participants in the LDCT group than in the chest radiography group after 6.5 years of follow-up, which suggests some overdiagnosis. Recent data from the Italian Continuing Observation of Smoking Subjects cohort study of approximately 5000 participants showed that of the 120 incident cancer cases, 25% were slow-growing or indolent (based on volume-doubling time]], thus possibly indicating some overdiagnosis with LDCT)18.

	Radiation exposure associated with LDCT ranged from 0.61 to 1.5 mSv per scan. To provide context, annual background radiation exposure in the United States averages 2.4 mSv, radiation exposure from mammography is 0.7 mSv, and radiation exposure from head computed tomography is 1.7 mSv. The risk for radiation-induced lung cancer depends on the age at which a person begins screening and the amount of cumulative radiation received. On the basis of modeling studies, starting annual LDCT screening before age 50 years may result in more radiation-related lung cancer deaths than starting annual screening after age 50 years9,  10.

	Overall, LDCT screening did not seem to result in substantial long-term psychological distress, although assessment has been limited. No studies reported long-term differences in anxiety or distress levels associated with LDCT in participants.

	No RCTs compared treatment of stage IA or IB lung cancer with surgical resection versus no treatment. Surgical resection is the standard of care in the United States for early-stage NSCLC. Studies of symptomatic and unselected patients reported 5-year survival rates associated with surgical resection of 71% to 90% for stage IA cancer and 42% to 75% for stage IB cancer. No RCTs of LDCT screening evaluated the harms associated with screen-detected cancer. Studies that reported the harms of surgical resection were done in patients who were identified in clinical practice and had comorbid conditions3.

	Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit

	On the basis of data from the systematic evidence review and modeling studies, the USPSTF determined with moderate certainty that annual LDCT screening provides substantial net benefit in persons aged 55 to 80 years at high risk for lung cancer. Evidence from the NLST supports this recommendation because participants in that trial were in this age range and had a similar degree of lung cancer risk from cumulative tobacco exposure. Persons who do not meet the minimum eligibility criteria for the NLST may have less net benefit and more harms from screening (persons aged 55 to 74 years at enrollment who have a ≥30 pack-year smoking history and are current smokers or have quit in the past 15 years). For these persons, the absolute benefit of screening is strongly associated with their age and smoking history.

	Modeling studies conducted by CISNET investigators for the USPSTF showed that annual LDCT screening yielded the greatest net benefit (compared with biennial or triennial screening) 9,  10. Benefits were measured as percentage of early-stage detection of lung cancer, percentage and absolute number of lung cancer deaths averted, and number of life-years gained. Harms were measured as number of total LDCT screenings per 100,000 persons and per person, number of cases of overdiagnosed lung cancer, and number of radiation-induced lung cancer deaths. The microsimulation models used standardized data on smoking history and non–lung cancer mortality to simulate the effects of various screening programs on the mortality rate of a U.S. cohort born in 1950. This cohort was chosen because these persons reach age 63 years (approximate midrange of participants' ages in the NLST) in 2013.

	Modeling evidence suggests that an annual screening program starting at age 55 years and ending after age 80 years (in persons who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit in the past 15 years) resulted in approximately 50% of lung cancer cases detected at an early stage9,  10. This screening protocol would result in a 14% reduction in lung cancer mortality, or an estimated 521 lung cancer deaths prevented per 100,000 persons in the population. The harms associated with this screening protocol are an estimated overdiagnosis of 10% of screen-detected cases and radiation-induced lung cancer deaths of less than 1%. As mentioned previously, a person's absolute net benefit from screening may depend not just on age but functional status and the presence of other comorbid conditions

	How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?

	Lung cancer is a proliferation of malignant cells arising in the tissues or airways of the lungs. In addition to age and exposure to tobacco smoke, other risk factors for lung cancer include family history; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; pulmonary fibrosis; and exposure to indoor cooking fumes, radon, asbestos, arsenic, chromium, and coal tar. Non–small cell lung cancer is a heterogeneous category that includes adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and undifferentiated carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma is the most common subtype, encompassing 36% of all lung cancer cases.

	Currently, 75% of patients with lung cancer present with symptoms of advanced local or metastatic disease that result in poor prognosis 2. At the earliest stage, median 5-year survival for NSCLC is 77%. Patients with localized disease (defined as cancer limited to the lung without metastasis to other organs or lymph nodes) have a median 5-year survival of 52% compared with 25% for those with regional spread and 4% for those with distant metastasis. Thus, earlier detection and treatment of lung cancer give patients a greater chance for cure.

	Response to Public Comments

	A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 30 July to 26 August 2013. Most of the comments generally agreed with the recommendation statement, although some suggested restricting screening to a higher-risk group and others suggested expanding eligibility criteria beyond those used in the NLST. Many comments expressed concerns about implementation of a screening program, predicting substantially greater harm in the community setting than was found in the NLST. Some comments expressed concern about the cost of implementing a screening program and the potential paradoxical effect of enabling persons to continue smoking with the perception that medical care can mitigate the risks of smoking.

	In response to these comments, the USPSTF further emphasized the importance of tobacco cessation as the primary way to prevent lung cancer and provided links to resources that clinicians can use to help their patients quit smoking. A section on implementation of a screening program was added, emphasizing the need for monitoring this implementation, quality assurance in diagnostic imaging, and appropriate follow-up to replicate the benefits observed in the NLST in the general population. The USPSTF also clarified that, in addition to age and smoking history, such risk factors as occupational exposure, family history, and history of other lung diseases are important when assessing patients' risks for lung cancer.

	The USPSTF acknowledges the importance of accurately identifying persons who are at highest risk to maximize the benefits and minimize the harms of screening and calls for more research to improve risk assessment tools. The USPSTF did not incorporate the costs of a screening program or the potential savings from a reduction in treatment of advanced lung cancer into the recommendation.",,Screening for Lung Cancer,"Lung Cancer, Screening, 2013"

At the time of admission to a hospital, birth center, or other delivery setting, women with unknown HBsAg status or with new or continuing risk factors for HBV infection (such as injection drug use or evaluation or treatment for a sexually transmitted disease) should receive screening.</p>

<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Infants born to HBV-infected mothers should receive hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin within 12 hours of birth. Infants born to mothers with unknown HBsAg status should receive hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth, followed by hepatitis B immune globulin as soon as possible (but not later than 7 days after birth) if the mother tests positive for HBsAg.</p>
<p>Pregnant women who test positive for HBsAg should be referred to an appropriate case-management program and should be provided with or referred for counseling and medical management of HBV infection. Counseling should include information about prevention of HBV transmission to sexual partners and household contacts and reassurance regarding the safety of breastfeeding in infants who receive appropriate prophylaxis.</p>

<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Screening for HBV infection in pregnant women is necessary but not sufficient to prevent disease transmission to newborns. To realize the maximum benefit from screening, primary care clinicians and delivery settings must establish effective systems for the accurate and timely transfer of maternal HBsAg test results to the labor, delivery, and newborn medical records.</p>

<h3>Research Needs/Gaps</h3>
<p>Research is needed to assess the effect of long-standing universal childhood hepatitis B vaccination on the magnitude of benefit of screening for HBV infection in U.S.-born pregnant women. Research is also needed to determine the net health benefit to the mother and infant of treating pregnant women whose chronic HBV infections are identified by prenatal screening.</p>",http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf09/hepb/hepbpgrs.htm#clinical,103,"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2>
<p>The American Academy of Family Physicians strongly recommends screening for HBV infection in pregnant women at their first prenatal visit. This recommendation is available at <a href=""http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/clinical/exam.html"">http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/clinical/exam.html</a>. </p>
<p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends routine screening of all pregnant women with HBsAg.</p>
<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends HBsAg testing for all pregnant adolescents &quot;at the time a pregnancy is discovered, regardless of hepatitis B immunization history and previous results of tests for HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg.&quot; This recommendation is available at <a href=""http://aapredbook.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/2006/1/2.9.2"">http://aapredbook.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/2006/1/2.9.2</a>. </p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all pregnant women be tested routinely for HBsAg during an early prenatal visit (for example, first trimester) in each pregnancy, even if they have been previously vaccinated or tested. This recommendation is available at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5416a1.htm?s_cid=rr5416a1_e"">http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5416a1.htm?s_cid=rr5416a1_e</a>.</p>",http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf09/hepb/hepbpgrs.htm#recommendations,"<h2>Rationale</h2>
 
<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>An estimated 24 000 infants are born each year to women in the United States who are infected with HBV. Between 30% and 40% of all chronic HBV infections result from perinatal transmission. Chronic HBV infections increase long-term morbidity and mortality by predisposing infected persons to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.</p>

<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>The principal screening test for detecting maternal HBV infection is the serologic identification of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Immunoassays for detecting HBsAg have a reported sensitivity and specificity greater than 98%.</p>

<h3>Benefits of Detection and Early Intervention</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that universal prenatal screening for HBV infection substantially reduces perinatal transmission of HBV and the subsequent development of chronic HBV infection. The current practice of vaccinating all infants against HBV infection and providing postexposure prophylaxis with hepatitis B immune globulin administered at birth to infants of mothers infected with HBV substantially reduces the risk for acquiring HBV infection.</p>

<h3>Harms of Detection and Early Intervention</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found no published studies that describe harms of screening for HBV infection in pregnant women. The USPSTF concluded that the potential harms of screening are no greater than small.</p>

<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes that there is high certainty that the net benefit of screening pregnant women for HBV infection is substantial.</p>",Hepatitis B in Pregnancy,"Hepatitis B in Pregnancy, 2009"
,,65,"The CDC recommends universal screening in communities where  12% of children aged 1 to 3 years have elevated blood levels, or, in communities that do not have prevalence data, if  27% of the housing was built before 1950. The CDC recommends targeted screening for all other children based on an individual risk assessment, including whether children receive Medicaid, Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), or other forms of governmental assistance. This approach is also supported by the American College of Preventive Medicine. <br><br>

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pediatricians learn whether city or state health departments provide guidance for screening children who are not eligible for Medicaid. If no such guidance is available, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pediatricians consider screening all children. Children should, ideally, be tested at 1 and 2 years of age.<br><br>

The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends screening 12-month-old infants for lead poisoning if they live in communities in which the prevalence of lead levels requiring intervention is high or undefined; if they live in or frequently visit a home built before 1950 that has dilapidated paint or recent or ongoing renovations or remodeling; if they have close contact with a person who has an elevated BLL or who lives near lead industry or heavy traffic; or if they live with someone whose job or hobby involves lead exposure, uses lead-based pottery, or takes traditional remedies that contain lead.<br><br>

Medicaid's Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment Program (EPSDT) requires that all children receive a screening blood lead test at 12 and 24 months of age; children between the ages of 36 and 72 months of age must receive a screening blood lead test if they have not previously been screened for lead poisoning.<br><br>

No national organizations currently recommend screening pregnant women for elevated BLLs.",,"<br><B>Importance<br></B>

BLLs in children have declined dramatically in the United States over the past 2 decades. However, segments of the population remain at increased risk for higher BLLs. Even relatively low BLLs are associated with neurotoxic effects in children. Severely elevated BLLs in symptomatic pregnant women are associated with poor health outcomes; however, BLLs in this range are rare in the US population. <br><br>

<B>Detection<br></B>
There is good evidence that venous sampling accurately detects elevated BLLs and fair evidence that validated questionnaires are modestly useful in identifying children at increased risk for elevated BLLs. <br><br>

<B>Benefits of Detection and Early Intervention<br></B>

The USPSTF found good-quality evidence that interventions do not result in sustained decreases in BLLs and found insufficient evidence (no studies) evaluating residential lead hazard-control efforts (ie, dust or paint removal, soil abatement, counseling, or education) or nutritional interventions for improving neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with mildly-to-moderately elevated BLLs. The USPSTF found no studies examining the effectiveness of screening or interventions in improving health outcomes in asymptomatic pregnant women. Given the low prevalence of elevated BLLs in children at average risk and asymptomatic pregnant women, the magnitude of potential benefit cannot be greater than small.<br><br>
A theoretical benefit of screening is that identification may prevent lead poisoning of other individuals in a shared environment, but the magnitude of this theoretical benefit is uncertain. <br><br>
<B>
Harms of Detection and Early Treatment<br></B>

There is good-quality evidence that chelation treatment in asymptomatic children does not improve neurodevelopmental outcomes and is associated with a slight diminution in cognitive performance. Chelation therapy may result in transient renal, hepatic, and other toxicity, mild gastrointestinal symptoms, sensitivity reactions, and rare life-threatening reactions. Residential lead-based paint and dust hazard-control treatments may lead to acutely increased BLLs from improper removal techniques. Potential harms of screening are false-positive results, anxiety, inconvenience, work or school absenteeism, and financial costs associated with repeated testing. Although the exact magnitude of these known and potential harms is uncertain, the overall magnitude is at least small. <br><br>
No studies have directly addressed the harms of screening and interventions for pregnant women. Although there is little specific evidence concerning the potential harms of interventions for pregnant women with elevated BLLs, the magnitude of harms from such interventions is also at least small. <br><br>

<B>USPSTF Assessment<br></B>

The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance between potential benefits and harms of routine screening for elevated BLLs in children at increased risk. Given the significant potential harms of treatment and residential lead hazard abatement, and no evidence of treatment benefit, the USPSTF concluded that the harms of screening for elevated BLLs in children at average risk and in asymptomatic pregnant women outweigh the benefits.",Lead,"Lead in Children & Pregnant Women, Screening, 2006"
