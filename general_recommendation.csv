0,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to all sexually active adolescents and to adults who are at increased risk for acquiring or transmitting STIs.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
All sexually active adolescents are at increased risk for STIs and should be counseled. Other risk groups that have been included in counseling studies include adults with current STIs or other infections within the past year, adults who have multiple sex partners, and adults who do not consistently use condoms.Clinicians should be aware of populations with a particularly high prevalence of STIs. African Americans have the highest STI prevalence of any racial/ethnic group, and STI prevalence is higher in American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Latinos than in white persons. Increased STI prevalence rates are also found in men who have sex with men (MSM), persons with low incomes living in urban settings, current or former inmates, military recruits, persons who exchange sex for money or drugs, persons with mental illness or a disability, current or former intravenous drug users, persons with a history of sexual abuse, and patients at public STI clinics.
<h3>Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>
Behavioral counseling interventions can reduce a person's likelihood of acquiring an STI. Interventions ranging in intensity from 30 minutes to 2 or more hours of contact time are beneficial. Evidence of benefit increases with intervention intensity. High-intensity counseling interventions (defined in the review as contact time of &ge;2 hours) were the most effective, moderate-intensity interventions (defined as 30 to 120 minutes) were less consistently beneficial, and low-intensity interventions (defined as &lt;30 minutes) were the least effective. Interventions can be delivered by primary care clinicians or through referral to trained behavioral counselors.Most successful approaches provided basic information about STIs and STI transmission; assessed the person's risk for transmission; and provided training in pertinent skills, such as condom use, communication about safe sex, problem solving, and goal setting. Many successful interventions used a targeted approach to the age, sex, and ethnicity of the participants and also aimed to increase motivation or commitment to safe sex practices. Intervention methods included face-to-face counseling, videos, written materials, and telephone support. The USPSTF did not find enough evidence to determine whether the following intervention characteristics were related independently to effectiveness: degree of cultural tailoring, group versus individual format, condom negotiation or other communication as an intervention component, counselor characteristics, setting, or type of control group.
<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>
The CDC provides information about STI prevention, testing, and resources at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/default.htm"" target=""_blank"">www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/default.htm</a>. It recommends that health care providers inform patients on how to reduce their risk for STI transmission, including abstinence, correct and consistent condom use, and limiting the number of sex partners. The CDC also maintains an inventory of efficacious interventions in the &ldquo;Compendium of Evidence-Based HIV Behavioral Interventions&rdquo; (available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/prevention/research/compendium"" target=""_blank"">www.cdc.gov/hiv/prevention/research/compendium</a>). The Community Preventive Services Task Force has issued several recommendations on the prevention of HIV/AIDS, other STIs, and teen pregnancy. The Community Guide discusses interventions that have been effective in school settings and for MSM (available at <a href=""http://www.thecommunityguide.org/hiv/index.html"" target=""_blank"">www.thecommunityguide.org/hiv/index.html</a>). The CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has issued recommendations on the control of vaccine-preventable diseases, including hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/index.html"" target=""_blank"">www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/index.html</a>). The National Coalition of Sexually Transmitted Disease Directors and the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors developed optimal care checklists for health providers of MSM (available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.ncsddc.org/publications/optimal-care-checklists-providers-msm-patients"" target=""_blank"">www.ncsddc.org/publications/optimal-care-checklists-providers-msm-patients</a>).
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The USPSTF has issued several recommendations related to screening for STIs, including screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea, hepatitis B, genital herpes, HIV, and syphilis. These recommendations can be found at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>.<br /><br />
<h3>Implementation</h3>
Intensive behavioral counseling may be delivered in primary care settings or other sectors of the health care system. This may require referral from the primary care clinician or system. In addition, risk-reduction counseling may be offered by community organizations, schools, and health departments or their affiliated STI clinics. Despite the seriousness and prevalence of STIs, primary care clinicians often do not provide counseling about sexual activity, contraception, or STIs during routine periodic health examinations or other health care visits, and many believe that counseling is ineffective. Surveys examining STI counseling by primary care clinicians have found wide variations in practice. Stronger linkages between the primary care setting and the community may greatly improve the delivery of this service. Providers should select behavioral counseling interventions on the basis of their effectiveness, appropriateness to the patient population, and feasibility of implementation. Examples of effective behavioral counseling interventions are described in the&nbsp;Table. &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Table.

<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Most of the studies identified by the USPSTF were in high-risk populations of adults or sexually active girls. Research on interventions that reduce risk for STIs in sexually active boys, prevent STIs in younger adolescents who are not yet sexually active, and reduce risk for STIs in older adults are needed. More data are needed from trials including both sexes and other broad-based interventions that could be implemented in or linked to primary care. The effectiveness of low-intensity interventions that are more practical in the typical primary care setting is another research gap. Promising approaches have been identified that need replication.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling1#Pod5,151,"The CDC recommends that all providers routinely obtain a sexual history from their patients and encourage risk reduction using various strategies (for example, prevention counseling)&nbsp;. It also recommends that HIV prevention counseling be offered and encouraged in all health care facilities that serve patients who are at high risk (for example, STI clinics) and persons living with HIV. <br /><br />The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends discussing contraception and STIs during the initial reproductive health visit for adolescent patients. It also recognizes that the annual well-woman visit provides an excellent opportunity to counsel patients about maintaining a healthy lifestyle and minimizing health risks. The visit should include screening, evaluation and counseling, and immunizations based on the patient's age and risk factors. In addition, applying principles of motivational interviewing (for example, prompting patients to use safe sex practices and more consistent contraception) to daily patient practices has proved effective in eliciting behavior change that contributes to positive health outcomes and improved patient-clinician communication. Comprehensive care, including prevention of STIs, is recommended for lesbian and bisexual patients; education about the risks for STIs and dispelling the perception that STI transmission between women is negligible will help these patients make informed decisions. All patients should be encouraged to use safe sex practices to reduce the risk for transmitting or acquiring STIs and HIV, such as using condoms on sex toys, gloves, and dental dams and avoiding sharing other sex paraphernalia&nbsp;. Several approaches (for example, gender-tailored and culturally appropriate interventions to reduce risk-taking behavior) can reduce the rate of HIV infection and optimize health in women of color&nbsp;. Practitioners should provide risk-reduction counseling to prevent STIs in women participating in noncoital activities (for example, mutual masturbation or anal sex). <br /><br />The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement states that counseling on sexual behaviors to prevent STIs could be recommended beginning at age 12 years&nbsp;and for higher-risk adults. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends one-on-one structured discussions with patients who are identified as high risk for STIs (if the health professional is trained in sexual health) or arranging these discussions with a trained practitioner. When appropriate, practitioners should provide one-on-one sexual advice about STI prevention and information on testing to persons younger than 18 years, including pregnant women and mothers. The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends intensive behavioral counseling for all sexually active adolescents and for adults who are at increased risk for STIs.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/sexually-transmitted-infections-behavioral-counseling1#Pod9,"<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that approximately 20 million new cases of STIs occur each year in the United States. Half of these cases occur in persons aged 15 to 24 years. Sexually transmitted infections are frequently asymptomatic, which leads persons to unknowingly transmit STIs to others. Serious sequelae of STIs include pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and cancer. Untreated STIs present during pregnancy or birth may cause harms to the infant, including perinatal infection, death, and serious physical and mental disabilities.</p>
<h3>Recognition of Behavior</h3>
<p>Primary care clinicians can identify adolescents and adults who are at increased risk for STIs. See the Clinical Considerations for more information.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that intensive behavioral counseling interventions reduce the likelihood of STIs in sexually active adolescents and in adults who are at increased risk. The USPSTF determined that this benefit is of moderate magnitude. The USPSTF also found adequate evidence that intensive interventions reduce risky sexual behaviors and increase the likelihood of condom use and other protective sexual practices.</p>
<h3>Harms of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of behavioral interventions to reduce the likelihood of STIs are small at most. The primary harm is the opportunity cost associated with intensive behavioral counseling interventions.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that intensive behavioral counseling interventions reduce the likelihood of STIs in sexually active adolescents and adults at increased risk, resulting in a moderate net benefit.</p>",Behavioral Counseling Interventions to Prevent Sexually Transmitted,"Sexually Transmitted Infections, Behavioral Counseling, 2014",,,,,
1,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
About 5% of women and 3% of men in the United States have subclinical hypothyroidism.&nbsp;Of note, several studies have shown that about 37% of persons with subclinical hypothyroidism spontaneously revert to a euthyroid state without intervention after several years.&nbsp;About 2% to 5% of persons with subclinical hypothyroidism develop &ldquo;overt&rdquo; thyroid dysfunction.<br /><br />One retrospective cohort study found that levothyroxine use in persons with subclinical hypothyroidism was associated with lower risk for ischemic heart disease events and overall mortality;&nbsp;however, the USPSTF did not identify any clinical trials that evaluated the causal relationship between treatment and subsequent cardiac events. The USPSTF did not identify any trials or observational studies that evaluated the effects of treatment of &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism (with or without symptoms) versus no treatment. <br /><br />Subclinical hyperthyroidism is present in about 0.7% of the U.S. population and is more common in women than men.&nbsp;One quarter of persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism revert to a euthyroid state without medical intervention over time.&nbsp;An estimated 1% to 2% of persons with TSH levels less than 0.1 mIU/L develop &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hyperthyroidism (with or without symptoms). Persons with TSH levels between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L are unlikely to progress to &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hyperthyroidism. <br /><br />The USPSTF did not identify any studies that evaluated the benefits of treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism on final health outcomes, such as fractures, cancer, or cardiovascular morbidity or mortality. Except for 1 small (<em>n</em>&nbsp;= 67) nonrandomized study that examined bone mineral density, no evidence was found on the effects of treatment of &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hyperthyroidism (with or without symptoms).
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
The harms of treatment of thyroid dysfunction have not been well-studied. The most important potential harms are false-positive results, labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment. <br /><br />False-positive results occur because TSH secretion is highly variable and sensitive to several common factors, such as acute illness or certain medications. Ascertainment of true- versus false-positive results is further complicated by a lack of consensus on what constitutes a normal reference interval. <br /><br />Consensus is also lacking on the appropriate point for clinical intervention, particularly for hypothyroidism. No clinical trial data support a treatment threshold to improve clinical outcomes. On the basis of expert opinion, a TSH level greater than 10.0 mIU/L is generally considered the threshold for initiation of treatment (in part because of the higher likelihood of progression to &ldquo;overt&rdquo;&mdash;even if still asymptomatic&mdash;thyroid dysfunction). The decision of whether and when to begin therapy in patients with TSH levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L is more controversial.A large magnitude of overdiagnosis and overtreatment is a likely consequence of screening for thyroid dysfunction, particularly because the disorder is defined by silent biochemical parameters rather than a set of reliable and consistent clinical symptoms. The high variability of TSH secretion levels and the frequency of reversion to normal thyroid function without treatment underscore the importance of not relying on a single abnormal laboratory value as a basis for diagnosis or the decision to start therapy. <br /><br />Currently, it is not possible to differentiate persons who will have advancing thyroid dysfunction of clinical importance from those whose TSH levels will remain biochemically stable or even normalize. Treating the latter group (at a minimum) will not lead to benefit, and these persons may experience harms associated with antithyroid medications, ablation therapy, and long-term thyroid hormone therapy.<br /><br />
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
Although exact estimates are not available for the United States, screening for thyroid dysfunction by primary care providers seems to be a common practice.&nbsp; In the United Kingdom, an estimated 18% to 25% of the adult population receives thyroid function testing each year.<br /><br />The annual number of dispensed prescriptions of levothyroxine sodium in the United States increased by 42% over a 5-year period, from 50 million in 2006 to 71 million in 2010.&nbsp;In 2013, there were more than 23 million new prescriptions and refills for a single name brand of thyroid hormone in the United States, making it the most commonly prescribed drug in the country.<br /><br />In 1996, a cross-sectional study of a U.S. population found that 39% of participants with TSH levels between 5.1 and 10.0 mIU/L received treatment.&nbsp;More recent evidence suggests that the median TSH level at initiation of thyroid hormone therapy has decreased over time; a retrospective cohort study in the United Kingdom found that the median TSH level at the time of first levothyroxine prescription decreased from 8.7 to 7.9 mIU/L between 2001 and 2009.<br /><br />Initiation and use of thyroid hormone therapy seem to be particularly common in older adults. Data from the CHS (Cardiovascular Health Study), a U.S. cohort of nearly 6000 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older, showed a steady increase in the overall percentage of older adults receiving thyroid hormone therapy (from 9% in 1989 to 20% in 2006) and a nonlinear probability of initiating levothyroxine therapy based on age; persons aged 85 years or older were more than twice as likely as those aged 65 to 69 years to begin thyroid hormone therapy (hazard ratio [HR], 2.34 [95% CI, 1.43 to 3.85]), independent of race or sex.<br /><br />Data on the proportion of asymptomatic persons with thyroid dysfunction who receive thyroid hormone therapy are lacking. However, given the high number of prescriptions for levothyroxine dispensed in the United States and the low prevalence of &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism among persons in the general population (0.3% and 0.5%, respectively,&nbsp;only a small fraction of whom are symptomatic), it is reasonable to conclude that many asymptomatic persons receive treatment. Clinicians seem to be treating more persons with thyroid dysfunction, at earlier times after initial diagnosis, and at TSH levels closer to normal.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
The most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States is chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis. Risk factors for an elevated TSH level include female sex, advancing age, white race, type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome, family history of thyroid disease, goiter, previous hyperthyroidism (possibly due in part to ablation therapy leading to iatrogenic thyroid dysfunction), and external-beam radiation in the head and neck area.<br /><br />Common causes of hyperthyroidism include Graves disease, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and functional thyroid nodules. Risk factors for a low TSH level include female sex; advancing age; black race; low iodine intake; personal or family history of thyroid disease; and ingestion of iodine-containing drugs, such as amiodarone.<br /><br />The USPSTF found no direct evidence that treatment of thyroid dysfunction based on risk level alters final health outcomes.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
The serum TSH test is the primary screening test for thyroid dysfunction. Multiple tests should be done over a 3- to 6-month interval to confirm or rule out abnormal findings. Follow-up testing of serum T4 levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 levels) and &ldquo;overt&rdquo; (abnormal T4 levels) thyroid dysfunction.
<h3>Screening Interval</h3>
The optimal screening interval for thyroid dysfunction (if one exists) is unknown.
<h3>Interventions</h3>
The principal treatment for hypothyroidism is oral T4 monotherapy (levothyroxine sodium). Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medications (such as methimazole) or nonreversible thyroid ablation therapy (for example, radioactive iodine or surgery). Although definitive data are lacking, treatment is generally recommended for patients with a TSH level that is undetectable or less than 0.1 mIU/L, particularly those with overt Graves disease or nodular thyroid disease. Treatment is typically not recommended for patients with TSH levels between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or when thyroiditis is the cause.<br /><br />
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Although detection and treatment of abnormal TSH levels (with or without abnormal T4 levels) in asymptomatic persons is common practice, evidence that this clinical approach improves important health outcomes is lacking. Long-term randomized, blinded, and controlled trials of screening for thyroid dysfunction would provide the most direct evidence on any potential benefits of this widespread practice. Serum TSH levels that define eligibility for enrollment, particularly based on age-specific ranges, are needed. Important clinical outcomes include cardiovascular- and cancer-related morbidity and mortality, as well as falls, fractures, functional status, and quality of life. Intermediate biochemical outcomes are less important; they are not reliable evidence of treatment effectiveness, and the effects of treatment of thyroid dysfunction on important clinical outcomes may be independent of any known intermediate outcomes. <br /><br />Before conducting screening trials, it may be more feasible for researchers to conduct well-designed treatment trials of either subclinical or asymptomatic &ldquo;overt&rdquo; thyroid dysfunction versus watchful waiting (including intervention if overt dysfunction becomes symptomatic), using final health outcomes, such as cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality, as the end points of interest. For such trials to be most informative, they should have clearly defined patient populations; intervention protocols (for example, treatment doses and target TSH levels); and study outcomes, including short- and long-term benefits and harms. <br /><br />Long-term observational studies are needed to better understand the natural history of untreated, asymptomatic thyroid dysfunction based on different serum TSH and T4 levels, as well as outcomes in persons with common but nonspecific symptoms. Useful information might be available from ongoing studies that collect biochemical samples; detailed demographic data; and information on functional status, quality of life, and other final health outcomes. <br /><br />Currently, the evidence does not show important benefits of treatment of subclinical thyroid dysfunction on blood pressure, BMI, lipid levels, cognitive function, or quality of life. Although treatment is associated with harms, it could have important long-term benefits on final health outcomes (such as reduced bone fractures and cardiovascular- and cancer-related morbidity and mortality) that may be independent of known intermediate outcomes. For example, evidence indicates that if treatment is effective for fractures or cardiovascular disease prevention, it is due to factors other than improvements in bone mineral density or lipid levels.&nbsp;The need for randomized trials that evaluate the effect of treatment of subclinical thyroid dysfunction on cardiac outcomes has been emphasized.&nbsp;Given the increasingly popular clinical practice of routine identification and treatment of asymptomatic persons with thyroid dysfunction and the treatment of those with vague and nonspecific symptoms, these trials are warranted. <br /><br />Studies that evaluate the harms of screening for and treatment of thyroid dysfunction are critically lacking. The USPSTF believes that false-positive results, labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment are important harms of any screening and prevention program and that these harms should be minimized. Additional evidence is needed on how to best communicate the clinical complexity surrounding screening for and treatment of asymptomatic thyroid dysfunction so that patients and their providers can make informed decisions. <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-dysfunction-screening#Pod5,150,"The American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommend considering screening for hypothyroidism in patients older than 60 years, as well as &ldquo;aggressive case finding&rdquo; (but not universal screening) in persons who are at increased risk for hypothyroidism and in women who are planning pregnancy.&nbsp;In 2006, 3 British professional associations (the Association for Clinical Biochemistry, the British Thyroid Association, and the British Thyroid Foundation) jointly recommended against routine screening for thyroid dysfunction in a healthy adult population, although the panel favors aggressive case finding in women with nonspecific symptoms.&nbsp;The American Academy of Family Physicians has endorsed the USPSTF recommendation.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-dysfunction-screening#Pod9,"<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Thyroid gland disorders are among the most common endocrine conditions evaluated and treated by clinicians. Thyroid dysfunction represents a continuum from asymptomatic biochemical changes to clinically symptomatic disease. In rare cases, it can produce life-threatening complications, such as myxedema coma or thyroid storm. .<br /><br /><em>Subclinical hypothyroidism</em>&nbsp;is defined as an asymptomatic condition in which a patient has a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level exceeding the upper threshold of a specified laboratory reference interval (commonly but arbitrarily defined as 4.5 mIU/L) but a normal thyroxine (T4) level.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-dysfunction-screening#citation3"">3</a>&nbsp;Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism are often further classified as having TSH levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L or greater than 10.0 mIU/L. .<br /><br />Despite its name,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism</em>&nbsp;does not require the presence of symptoms and has been defined biochemically by an elevated TSH level and a low T4 level. As such, it encompasses a range of low T4 levels that may (or may not) be associated with a set of relatively subtle and nonspecific clinical symptoms, such as fatigue, feeling cold, weight gain, hair loss, and constipation. <br /><br /><em>Subclinical hyperthyroidism</em>&nbsp;is defined as an asymptomatic condition in which a patient has a serum TSH level below the lower threshold of a specified laboratory reference interval (usually 0.4 mIU/L) but normal T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) levels. Patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism are further classified as having &ldquo;low but detectable&rdquo; (about 0.1 to 0.4 mIU/L) or &ldquo;clearly low&rdquo; or &ldquo;undetectable&rdquo; (&lt;0.1 mIU/L) TSH levels.<br /><br />Despite its name,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;overt&rdquo; hyperthyroidism</em>&nbsp;does not require the presence of symptoms and has been defined biochemically by a low or undetectable TSH level and an elevated T4 or T3 level. When present, symptoms are often relatively nonspecific (for example, weight loss, heart palpitations, heat intolerance, and hyperactivity).<br /><br />For the purposes of this recommendation,&nbsp;<em>thyroid dysfunction</em>&nbsp;is defined as a spectrum of disorders related to the thyroid gland. The spectrum begins with asymptomatic subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. In the middle of the spectrum are asymptomatic &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, defined biochemically by changes in serum TSH and T4 levels. At the end of the spectrum is thyroid disease, which is reserved for symptomatic &ldquo;overt&rdquo; hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (that is, persistently abnormal serum TSH and T4 levels and clearly associated clinical signs and symptoms that cannot be better explained by another condition).<br /><br />In making its recommendations about clinical preventive services, the USPSTF focuses on asymptomatic populations that do not have known signs or symptoms of disease.</p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>Early detection and treatment of asymptomatic persons with abnormal serum TSH levels with or without abnormal T4 levels may be beneficial because it may prevent longer-term morbidity and mortality from fractures, cancer, or cardiovascular disease. However, widespread screening and treatment of subclinical thyroid dysfunction can also result in harms due to labeling, false-positive results, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment.<br /><br />The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening can detect &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo; serum TSH levels in asymptomatic persons. However, what constitutes an abnormal TSH level is uncertain. Laboratory reference intervals are based on the statistical distribution of TSH levels across the general population (for example, using the 97.5th percentile as an upper boundary for normal) rather than according to the association of a TSH level with symptoms, adverse outcomes, or particular risk factors for disease.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/thyroid-dysfunction-screening#citation3"">3</a>&nbsp;There is professional disagreement about the appropriate cut points for the lower and upper boundaries of normal TSH levels in the general population and in subgroups, such as older adults, where values differ from the overall population distribution (for example, shifting to a higher range of normal).<br /><br />Accurate interpretation of serum TSH levels is further complicated by measurement variability and the sensitivity of TSH secretion to conditions other than thyroid dysfunction. These issues have led many professional groups to recommend repeating thyroid function tests if the results fall above or below a specified reference interval for confirmation of persistent dysfunction (for example, over 3- to 6-month intervals) in asymptomatic persons before making a diagnosis or considering any treatment strategies, unless the serum TSH level is greater than 10.0 or less than 0.1 mIU/L.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults leads to clinically important benefits. In particular, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine whether screening for thyroid dysfunction reduces cardiovascular disease or related morbidity and mortality. <br /><br />The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for and treatment of thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults does not improve quality of life or provide clinically meaningful improvements in blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), bone mineral density, or lipid levels. It also does not improve cognitive function, at least through the duration of available trials (&ge;1 to 2 years).</p>
<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening for and treatment of thyroid dysfunction. Indirect evidence points to the likelihood of important and frequent harms associated with screening in asymptomatic persons. Foremost among these are frequent false-positive results; the psychological effects of labeling; and a large degree of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of biochemically defined abnormal TSH levels (with or without abnormal serum T4 levels) that may revert to normal, not progress, or never result in health problems even if they do progress, particularly in persons with TSH levels less than 10 mIU/L.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.<br /><br />If clinicians offer screening for thyroid dysfunction to asymptomatic persons, they should first ensure that patients clearly understand the uncertainties surrounding any potential clinical benefit of screening as well as the possibility of harm this choice may engender.</p>",Screening for Thyroid Dysfunction,"Thyroid Dysfunction, Screening, 2015",,,,,
2,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to adults aged 18 years or older, including pregnant women. The USPSTF previously issued a separate recommendation statement on primary care interventions for tobacco use in children and adolescents (available online at <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>). Although the USPSTF acknowledges that tobacco may be used in other forms and that other substances aside from tobacco may be smoked, they are not the focus of this recommendation.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
According to the 2012&ndash;2013 National Adult Tobacco Survey, smoking prevalence is higher in the following groups: men; adults aged 25 to 44 years; persons with a race or ethnicity category of &ldquo;other, non-Hispanic&rdquo;; persons with a GED (vs. graduate-level education); persons with an annual household income of less than $20,000; and persons who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.&nbsp;Higher rates of smoking have been found in persons with mental health conditions.
<h3>Implementation Considerations of Behavioral and Pharmacotherapy Interventions</h3>
The information that follows on the implementation of interventions for smoking cessation draws from the USPSTF systematic evidence review&nbsp;and the 2008 Public Health Service guidelines.
<h4>Assessment of Smoking Status</h4>
The 5 A&rsquo;s framework (available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/clinicians-providers/guidelines-recommendations/tobacco/5steps.html"" target=""_blank"">www.ahrq.gov/professionals/clinicians-providers/guidelines-recommendations/tobacco/5steps.html</a>) is a useful strategy for engaging patients in discussions about smoking cessation. This program includes the following: 1) Asking every patient about tobacco use, 2) Advising all tobacco users to quit, 3) Assessing their willingness to attempt to quit, 4) Assisting with attempts to quit, and 5) Arranging follow-up.&nbsp;&ldquo;Ask, Advise, Refer&rdquo; is another approach and involves asking patients about tobacco use, advising those who smoke to quit, and referring them to evidence-based interventions. Treating smoking status as a vital sign and recording smoking status at every health visit are also frequently used to assess smoking status. Because many pregnant women who smoke do not report it, using multiple-choice questions to assess smoking status in this group may improve disclosure.
<h4>Nonpregnant Adults</h4>
Both intervention types (pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions) are effective and recommended; combinations of interventions are most effective, and all should be offered. The best and most effective combinations are those that are acceptable to and feasible for an individual patient; clinicians should consider the patient&rsquo;s specific medical history and preferences and offer and provide the combination that works best for the patient.
<h5>Many behavioral interventions are available to encourage smoking cessation in adults. These interventions can be delivered in the primary care setting or can be referred to community settings with feedback to the primary care provider. Effective behavioral interventions include in-person behavioral support and counseling, telephone counseling, and self-help materials (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/tobacco-use-in-adults-and-pregnant-women-counseling-and-interventions1#tab"">Table</a>). Behavioral interventions may increase rates of smoking abstinence from a baseline range of approximately 5% to 11% in control groups to 7% to 13% in intervention groups.</h5>
<ul>
<li>Both minimal (&lt;20 minutes in 1 visit) and intensive (&ge;20 minutes plus &gt;1 follow-up visit) physician-advice interventions effectively increase the proportion of adults who successfully quit smoking and remain abstinent for at least 6 months.</li>
<li>Brief, in-person behavioral counseling sessions (&lt;10 minutes) effectively increase the proportion of adults who successfully quit smoking and remain abstinent for 1 year. Although less effective than longer interventions, even minimal interventions (&lt;3 minutes) have increased cessation rates in some studies.
<ul>
<li>There is a dose&ndash;response relationship between the intensity of counseling and cessation rates (that is, more or longer sessions improve cessation rates).
<ul>
<li>Several sessions should be provided; according to the Public Health Service guidelines, patients should receive at least 4 in-person counseling sessions.</li>
<li>Cessation rates may plateau after 90 minutes of total counseling contact time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Effective interventions can be delivered by various types of primary care providers, including physicians, nurses, psychologists, social workers, and cessation counselors.</li>
<li>Both individual and group counseling are effective.</li>
<li>Effective counseling interventions provide social support and training in practical problem-solving skills.
<ul>
<li>Training in problem-solving skills includes helping persons who smoke to recognize situations that increase their risk for smoking, develop coping skills to overcome common barriers to quitting, and develop a plan to quit.</li>
<li>Basic information about smoking and successful quitting should be provided.</li>
<li>Complementary practices that improve cessation rates include motivational interviewing, assessing readiness to change, and offering more intensive counseling or referrals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Telephone counseling interventions are effective.
<ul>
<li>Effective interventions provide at least 3 telephone calls.</li>
<li>Telephone counseling can be provided by professional counselors or health care providers who are trained to offer advice over the telephone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Providing self-help materials (primarily print-based) that are tailored to the individual patient (that is, beyond a brochure that simply describes the health effects of smoking) is also effective in improving smoking abstinence.&nbsp;Evidence on nontailored, print-based, self-help materials; computer-based programs; and mobile phone&ndash;based interventions (such as mHEALTH) is mixed, although several trials show promise.
<h5>Pharmacotherapy</h5>
<ul>
<li>The only pharmacotherapy interventions approved by the FDA for the treatment of tobacco dependence in adults are bupropion SR, varenicline, and NRT (including nicotine transdermal patches, lozenges, gum, inhalers, or nasal spray).</li>
<li>Evidence suggests that rates of smoking abstinence may increase from approximately 10% in control groups (placebo or no pharmacotherapy) to 17% in persons using any form of NRT, from roughly 11% in control groups (placebo or no bupropion SR) to 19% in those using bupropion SR, and from approximately 12% in control groups (placebo) to 28% in those using varenicline. Information on dosing regimens is available in the package inserts of individual medications or at&nbsp;<a href=""http://betobaccofree.hhs.gov"" target=""_blank"">http://betobaccofree.hhs.gov</a>. Information for consumers on FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation is available at <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm198176.htm"" target=""_blank"">www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm198176.htm</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Combinations of Pharmacotherapy</h5>
<ul>
<li>Using 2 types of NRT has been found to be more effective than using a single type. In particular, there was evidence that combining a nicotine patch with a rapid-delivery form of NRT is more effective than using a single type.</li>
<li>Some studies suggest that NRT in combination with bupropion SR may be more efficacious than bupropion SR alone but not necessarily NRT alone.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Combinations of Behavioral and Pharmacotherapy Interventions</h5>
<ul>
<li>Combining behavioral and pharmacotherapy interventions may increase cessation rates from approximately 8% to 14%&nbsp;compared with usual care or minimal behavioral interventions (such as self-help materials or brief advice on quitting).
<ul>
<li>These combination interventions often have behavioral components delivered by specialized cessation counselors or trained staff and often use NRT.</li>
<li>Combination interventions often involve several sessions (&ge;4) and tend to be more successful with more sessions.
<ul>
<li>The largest effect was found in interventions that provided 8 or more sessions, although the difference in effect among the number of sessions was not significant.</li>
<li>Contact time ranged from 0 to greater than 300 minutes; interventions lasting 91 to 300 minutes were most common.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>The addition of behavioral support to pharmacotherapy also significantly increased cessation rates from approximately 18% in persons using pharmacotherapy alone to 21% in those using a combination of pharmacotherapy and behavioral support.</li>
<li>Intensity of behavioral support ranged from 0 to greater than 300 minutes of contact; interventions most often involved greater than 91 minutes of contact (roughly 40% were 91 to 300 minutes, and 60% were &gt;300 minutes).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pregnant Women</h4>
<h5>Behavioral Interventions</h5>
<ul>
<li>Effective behavioral interventions in pregnant women who smoke include counseling, feedback, health education, incentives, and social support. Compared with usual care or controls, behavioral interventions can increase rates of smoking abstinence from approximately 11% to 15% in pregnant women.</li>
<li>Effective behavioral interventions provided more intensive counseling than minimal advice and other standard components of usual care.</li>
<li>Counseling sessions augmented with messages and self-help materials tailored for pregnant women who smoke increased abstinence rates during pregnancy compared with brief, generic counseling interventions alone.
<ul>
<li>Counseling specific to pregnant women should include messages about the effects of smoking on both maternal and fetal health and clear, strong advice to quit as soon as possible. Although smoking cessation at any point during pregnancy yields substantial health benefits for the expectant mother and baby, quitting early in pregnancy provides the greatest benefit to the fetus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Other Interventions</h4>
Health care system&ndash;based strategies that have been shown to improve rates of clinical interventions for smoking cessation in primary care settings include implementing an identification system for tobacco users; providing education, resources, and feedback to promote clinician intervention; and dedicating staff to provide treatment for tobacco dependence and assessing the delivery of this treatment in staff performance evaluations.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
Primary care clinicians may find the following resources useful in talking with adults and pregnant women about smoking cessation: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fact sheets on quitting smoking (<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/cessation/quitting/index.htm"" target=""_blank"">www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/cessation/quitting/index.htm</a>), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&rsquo; BeTobaccoFree (<a href=""http://betobaccofree.hhs.gov/quit-now/index.html#professionals"" target=""_blank"">http://betobaccofree.hhs.gov/quit-now/index.html#professionals</a>), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&rsquo; SmokeFreeWomen (<a href=""http://women.smokefree.gov/pregnancy-motherhood.aspx"" target=""_blank"">http://women.smokefree.gov/pregnancy-motherhood.aspx</a>), and the Public Health Service&rsquo;s 2008 clinical practice guidelines. <br /><br />In addition, the following resources may be useful to primary care clinicians and practices trying to implement interventions for smoking cessation: the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration&ndash;Health Resources and Services Administration Center for Integrated Health Solutions&rsquo; resources for smoking cessation (<a href=""http://www.integration.samhsa.gov/health-wellness/wellness-strategies/tobacco-cessation-2"" target=""_blank"">www.integration.samhsa.gov/health-wellness/wellness-strategies/tobacco-cessation-2</a>), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state and community resources for tobacco-control programs (<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/stateandcommunity/index.htm"" target=""_blank"">www.cdc.gov/tobacco/stateandcommunity/index.htm</a>), and the World Health Organization&rsquo;s toolkit for delivering brief smoking interventions in primary care (<a href=""http://www.who.int/tobacco/publications/smoking_cessation/9789241506953/en"" target=""_blank"">www.who.int/tobacco/publications/smoking_cessation/9789241506953/en</a>).
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statements</h3>
<h4>Pharmacotherapy for Pregnant Women</h4>
Although smoking prevalence is lower in pregnant women than nonpregnant women of the same age, approximately 1 in 6 pregnant women aged 15 to 44 years smoke.&nbsp;Smoking during pregnancy slows fetal growth, doubles the risk for delivering a baby with low birthweight, and increases the risk for fetal death by 25% to 50%. For women in whom behavioral counseling does not work, other options to promote smoking cessation may be beneficial. <br /><br />A few studies have evaluated the benefit of NRT on perinatal and child health outcomes. Although results generally suggest a potential benefit, the overall evidence is too limited to draw clear conclusions. Nicotine replacement therapy is a pregnancy category D medication, which means that there is positive evidence of fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans. However, it has been suggested that NRT may be safer than smoking during pregnancy.&nbsp;Potential adverse events reported include increased rates of cesarean delivery, slightly increased diastolic blood pressure, and skin reactions to the patch. Potential adverse events reported in nonpregnant adults include higher rates of low-risk cardiovascular events, such as tachycardia. There is no evidence of perinatal harms from NRT, although few trials reported consistently on these adverse events.<br /><br />The USPSTF identified no studies on bupropion SR or varenicline pharmacotherapy during pregnancy. These drugs are both pregnancy category C, which means that animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus but there are no adequate well-controlled studies in humans.<br /><br />In the absence of clear evidence on the balance of benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy in pregnant women, clinicians are encouraged to consider the severity of smoking behavior in each patient and engage in shared decision making to determine the best individual treatment course.
<h4>ENDS</h4>
Approximately 69% of adults who smoke daily report interest in quitting, and roughly 43% attempted to quit in the previous year.&nbsp;To date, no ENDS manufacturer has applied for or received FDA approval to market its product for smoking cessation purposes. According to a small 2013 study, approximately two thirds of physicians reported that they believed that electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) were a helpful aid for smoking cessation, and 35% recommended them to patients.&nbsp;A recent small survey of e-cigarette users found that 56% reported using them to quit or reduce cigarette use, and 26% reported using them to smoke in places where conventional cigarettes were banned.&nbsp;Because of the perception by the public and clinicians that ENDS may be used for quitting conventional smoking, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence in this area. No studies evaluated the use of ENDS for smoking cessation in pregnant women or adolescents. The USPSTF identified only 2 RCTs that evaluated the effect of e-cigarettes on smoking abstinence in adults and found mixed results. Neither study reported any serious adverse events related to ENDS use; however, potential concerns raised in other literature include the unknown safety and toxicity of their components and aerosols,&nbsp;and poisoning in children who mishandle nicotine cartridges.&nbsp;How the ingredients in ENDS may affect a fetus is also unknown. Overall, the USPSTF found the evidence on the use of ENDS as a smoking cessation tool in adults, including pregnant women, and adolescents to be insufficient.
<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>
Given the public health significance of the consequences of tobacco use, numerous public health interventions aim to prevent tobacco use and promote smoking cessation. The Community Preventive Services Task Force offers several recommendations on interventions that can be used in community settings (available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.thecommunityguide.org/tobacco/index.html"" target=""_blank"">www.thecommunityguide.org/tobacco/index.html</a>). The Surgeon General&rsquo;s report, &ldquo;The Health Consequences of Smoking&mdash;50 Years of Progress,&rdquo; discusses initiatives to end the tobacco use epidemic in the United States.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/tobacco-use-in-adults-and-pregnant-women-counseling-and-interventions1#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;In addition, the USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians provide interventions, including education or brief counseling, to prevent the initiation of tobacco use among school-aged children and adolescents (available at<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).<br /><br /><strong><br /></strong>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
A large body of evidence on interventions for smoking cessation already exists, and the overall benefit of pharmacotherapy and behavioral counseling to promote smoking cessation is well-established. However, further research is still needed to elucidate specific effective features of complex behavioral counseling interventions, benefits of pharmacotherapy in specific subpopulations, and the efficacy of newer technology-based interventions. Although numerous behavioral interventions for smoking cessation are available to primary care clinicians, further research is needed to better clarify the effects of varying levels of intensity (such as how the number of sessions and number of minutes per session affect continuous abstinence rates), which settings of behavioral counseling interventions are most conducive to quitting (individual vs. group, health vs. community, and primary care vs. specialty), and ways to tailor self-help materials. Further research is needed on the benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy in specific subpopulations, such as pregnant women and adults with mental health conditions. Research that directly compares types of pharmacotherapy in different populations may help inform providers on which interventions to use with which patients. Additional research is also needed on interventions for light or nondaily smokers and to better understand the effectiveness of newer technology platforms for interventions for smoking cessation, such as Internet-based programs, mobile or smartphone applications, and text-messaging programs. Although no ENDS manufacturer has applied to the FDA to have its product approved as a therapeutic device, because of the perception by both the public and clinicians that ENDS may be used as an option for quitting conventional smoking, further research is needed on the safety, benefits, and harms of ENDS.<br /><br />",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/tobacco-use-in-adults-and-pregnant-women-counseling-and-interventions1#Pod5,153,"Numerous professional societies and health organizations, including the American College of Physicians,&nbsp;American College of Preventive Medicine,&nbsp;American Heart Association,&nbsp;and American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&nbsp;recommend that clinicians screen for tobacco use and provide interventions to patients who smoke. More recently, with the emergence and increased use of e-cigarettes, some organizations have incorporated statements about e-cigarettes into their guidelines. Both the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&nbsp;and the American Heart Association&nbsp;recommend that e-cigarettes be included in smoking screening questions. The American Heart Association also concludes that evidence is insufficient to counsel patients on the use of e-cigarettes as a primary cessation aid. The American Academy of Family Physicians has updated its recommendations, which are consistent with those of the USPSTF.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/tobacco-use-in-adults-and-pregnant-women-counseling-and-interventions1#Pod9,"<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in the United States. Cigarette smoking results in more than 480,000 premature deaths each year and accounts for approximately 1 in every 5 deaths.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/tobacco-use-in-adults-and-pregnant-women-counseling-and-interventions1#citation1"">1</a> In pregnant women, smoking increases the risk for congenital anomalies; perinatal complications, such as preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and placental abruption; miscarriage and stillbirth; and neonatal or pediatric complications, such as sudden infant death syndrome and impaired lung function in childhood.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/tobacco-use-in-adults-and-pregnant-women-counseling-and-interventions1#citation1"">1-4</a> An estimated 42.1 million U.S. adults (nearly 18% of the population) currently smoke.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/tobacco-use-in-adults-and-pregnant-women-counseling-and-interventions1#citation5"">5</a></p>
<h3>Recognition of Behavior</h3>
<p>The benefits of assessing patients&rsquo; smoking behavior are well-established. Common approaches for clinicians include recording a patient&rsquo;s smoking status as a vital sign or using the 5 A&rsquo;s: 1) Ask about smoking; 2) Advise to quit through clear, personalized messages; 3) Assess willingness to quit; 4) Assist in quitting; and 5) Arrange follow-up and support. Another approach is &ldquo;Ask, Advise, Refer,&rdquo; which encourages clinicians to ask patients about tobacco use, advise them to quit, and refer them to telephone quit lines and/or other evidence-based cessation interventions.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Interventions</h3>
<h4>Nonpregnant Adults</h4>
<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that behavioral interventions (including in-person behavioral support and counseling, telephone counseling, and self-help materials) alone or combined with pharmacotherapy substantially improve achievement of tobacco cessation in nonpregnant adults who smoke. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that pharmacotherapy interventions, including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion hydrochloride sustained-release (buproprion SR), and varenicline&mdash;with or without behavioral counseling interventions&mdash;substantially improve achievement of tobacco cessation in nonpregnant adults who smoke. The USPSTF also found convincing evidence that using 2 types of NRT moderately improves achievement of tobacco smoking cessation over using 1 type and that addition of NRT to treatment with bupropion SR provides additional benefit over use of bupropion SR alone. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine the effect of ENDS on achievement of tobacco smoking cessation.</p>
<h4>Pregnant Women</h4>
<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that behavioral interventions substantially improve achievement of tobacco smoking abstinence in pregnant women, increase infant birthweight, and reduce risk for preterm birth. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits of NRT and no evidence on the benefits of bupropion SR, varenicline, or ENDS to achieve tobacco cessation in pregnant women who smoke or to improve perinatal outcomes in infants.</p>
<h3>Harms of Interventions</h3>
<h4>Nonpregnant Adults</h4>
<p>The USPSTF determined that there is adequate evidence to bound the magnitude of harms of behavioral interventions for tobacco cessation in nonpregnant adults who smoke as small to none. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of NRT, bupropion SR, or varenicline for tobacco cessation in adults who smoke are small. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine the harms of ENDS.</p>

<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of behavioral interventions and FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for tobacco cessation, alone or combined, in nonpregnant adults who smoke is substantial.The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of behavioral interventions for tobacco cessation on perinatal outcomes and smoking abstinence in pregnant women who smoke is substantial.The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on pharmacotherapy interventions for tobacco cessation in pregnant women is insufficient because of a lack of studies, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on the use of ENDS for tobacco smoking cessation in adults, including pregnant women, is insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. The USPSTF has identified the lack of well-designed, randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) on ENDS that report smoking abstinence or adverse events as a critical gap in the evidence.</p>",Behavioral and Pharmacotherapy Interventions for Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults and Pregnant Women,"Tobacco Smoking Cessation in Adults and Pregnant Women, Behavioral and Pharmacotherapy Interventions, 2015",,,,,
3,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to adults aged 18 years or older without known hypertension.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
<h4>Office Blood Pressure Measurement</h4>
Office measurement of blood pressure is most commonly done with a manual or automated sphygmomanometer. Little research has been done on the best approach to measuring blood pressure in the office setting. Most clinical trials of hypertension treatment, at a minimum, used the mean of 2 measurements taken while the patient was seated (some used the mean of the second and third measurements), allowed for at least 5 minutes between entry into the office and blood pressure measurement, used an appropriately sized arm cuff, and placed the patient&rsquo;s arm at the level of the right atrium during measurement. Multiple measurements over time have better positive predictive value for hypertension than a single measurement. Automated office blood pressure, which is an average of multiple automated measurements taken while the patient is alone in a room, may yield results similar to those of daytime ABPM.Blood pressure is affected by various short-term factors, such as emotions, stress, pain, physical activity, and drugs (including caffeine and nicotine). In addition to within-patient temporal variability, isolated clinic hypertension in the medical setting and in the presence of medical personnel (known as &ldquo;white coat&rdquo; hypertension) is well-documented. Epidemiologic data suggest that 15% to 30% of the population believed to have hypertension may have lower blood pressure outside of the office setting.&nbsp;The disadvantages of diagnosing hypertension solely in the office setting include measurement errors, the limited number of measurements that can be made conveniently, and the confounding risk for isolated clinic hypertension.
<h4>Ambulatory and Home Blood Pressure Monitoring</h4>
In addition to office blood pressure measurement, ABPM and HBPM may be used to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension after initial screening. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring devices are small, portable machines that record blood pressure at regular intervals over 12 to 24 hours while patients go about their normal activities and while they are sleeping. Measurements are typically taken at 20- to 30-minute intervals. Home blood pressure measurement devices are fully automated oscillometric devices that record measurements taken from the patient&rsquo;s brachial artery. Many of these devices are available for retail purchase, and some have undergone technical validation according to recommended protocols. <br /><br />The USPSTF found convincing evidence that ABPM is the best method for diagnosing hypertension. Although the criteria for establishing hypertension varied across studies, there was significant discordance between the office diagnosis of hypertension and 12- and 24-hour average blood pressures using ABPM, with significantly fewer patients requiring treatment based on ABPM (Figure 1). &nbsp;Elevated ambulatory systolic blood pressure was consistently and significantly associated with increased risk for fatal and nonfatal stroke and cardiovascular events, independent of office blood pressure (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/high-blood-pressure-in-adults-screening#fig2"">Figure 2</a>).&nbsp;For these reasons, the USPSTF recommends ABPM as the reference standard for confirming the diagnosis of hypertension. <br /><br />Good-quality evidence suggests that confirmation of hypertension with HBPM may be acceptable. Several studies showed that elevated home blood pressure was significantly associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events, stroke, and all-cause mortality, independent of office blood pressure (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/high-blood-pressure-in-adults-screening#fig3"">Figure 3</a>).&nbsp;However, fewer studies have compared HBPM with office blood pressure measurement, so the evidence is not as substantial as it is for ABPM.&nbsp;Therefore, the USPSTF considers ABPM to be the reference standard for confirming the diagnosis of hypertension. However, the USPSTF acknowledges that the use of ABPM may be problematic in some situations. Home blood pressure monitoring using appropriate protocols is an alternative method of confirmation if ABPM is not available. Measurements from the office, HBPM, and ABPM all must be interpreted with care and in the context of the individual patient. Patients with very high blood pressure or signs of end-organ damage may need immediate treatment.
<h3>Screening Interval</h3>
The USPSTF recommends annual screening for adults aged 40 years or older and for those who are at increased risk for high blood pressure. Persons at increased risk include those who have high-normal blood pressure (130 to 139/85 to 89 mm Hg), those who are overweight or obese, and African Americans. Adults aged 18 to 39 years with normal blood pressure (&lt;130/85 mm Hg) who do not have other risk factors should be rescreened every 3 to 5 years<em>.</em>&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends rescreening with properly measured office blood pressure and, if blood pressure is elevated, confirming the diagnosis of hypertension with ABPM.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
The benefits of treatment of hypertension in preventing important health outcomes are well-documented. Moderate- to high-quality randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrate the efficacy of treatment of the general population of persons aged 60 years or older to a target blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg in reducing the incidence of stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease events. Similarly, RCTs demonstrate the efficacy of treatment of younger adults to a target diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg in reducing cerebrovascular events, heart failure, and overall mortality. &nbsp;In the absence of sufficient RCT data, expert opinion has been used to establish a target systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg in adults younger than 60 years&nbsp;and some experts believe that this should also be maintained in those aged 60 years or older.&nbsp;However, published results from a recently completed large RCT, the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, are not yet available to inform current treatment goals. Clinicians should consult updated blood pressure treatment guidelines informed by this trial as they become available. <br /><br />For nonblack patients, initial treatment consists of a thiazide diuretic, calcium-channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin-receptor blocker. For black patients, initial treatment is thiazide or a calcium-channel blocker. Initial or add-on treatment for patients with chronic kidney disease consists of either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin-receptor blocker (not both).<br /><br />
<h3>Suggestions for Implementation</h3>
Screening for high blood pressure may be done in the office setting by using the proper methods described previously. However, the USPSTF recommends confirmation outside of the clinical setting before a diagnosis of hypertension is made and treatment is started. Confirmation may be done by using HBPM or ABPM. Because blood pressure is a continuous value with natural variations throughout the day, repeated measurements over time are generally more accurate in establishing a diagnosis of hypertension. The USPSTF did not find evidence for a single gold standard protocol for HBPM or ABPM. However, both may be used in conjunction with proper office measurement to make a diagnosis and guide management and treatment options. Blood pressure cuffs used for HBPM should be compliant with sphygmomanometer standards set by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation.
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Most of the evidence supports ABPM as the best method for confirming a diagnosis of hypertension. More research is needed on the accuracy of HBPM versus ABPM and the best HBPM protocols for follow-up of elevated office blood pressure. The diagnostic accuracy of blood pressure measurements taken by a visiting nurse or another health care worker in the home setting also merits more research. Self-use blood pressure measurement kiosks in community settings, such as pharmacies and grocery stores, may be frequently used by the public but are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. More research on the accuracy of kiosk measurements is needed. New technology has been developed that uses a wireless brachial blood pressure monitor that connects to a smartphone, a desktop computer, or the Internet for recording and analysis. More research is needed on the accuracy of these monitors, their use in primary prevention, and their association with long-term health outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/high-blood-pressure-in-adults-screening#clinical-considerations,152,The Eighth Joint National Committee does not address the diagnosis of hypertension in its 2014 guidelines.&nbsp,The Seventh Joint National Committee recommends screening for high blood pressure at least once every 2 years in adults with blood pressure less than 120/80 mm Hg and every year in adults with blood pressure of 120 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg.&nbsp,The American Heart Association recommends blood pressure measurement at each regular health care visit or at least once every 2 years in adults with blood pressure less than 120/80 mm Hg.&nbsp,The American Academy of Family Physicians&rsquo, recommendation is similar to that of the USPSTF.The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends blood pressure screening as part of women&rsquo,s annual health care visits.,http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/high-blood-pressure-in-adults-screening#recommendations-of-others,"<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>High blood pressure is a prevalent condition, affecting approximately 30% of the adult population.&nbsp;It is the most commonly diagnosed condition at outpatient office visits. High blood pressure is a major contributing risk factor to heart failure, heart attack, stroke, and chronic kidney disease. In 2010, it was the primary or contributing cause of death for more than 362,000 Americans.</p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>The evidence on the benefits of screening for high blood pressure is well-established. In 2007, the USPSTF reaffirmed its 2003 recommendation to screen for hypertension in adults aged 18 years or older (A recommendation). Previous evidence reviews commissioned by the USPSTF found good-quality evidence that screening for hypertension has few major harms and provides substantial benefits.&nbsp;However, these reviews did not address the diagnostic accuracy of different blood pressure measurement protocols or identify a reference standard for measurement confirmation. For the current recommendation, the USPSTF examined the diagnostic accuracy of office blood pressure measurement, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), and home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM). The USPSTF also assessed the accuracy of these blood pressure measurements and methods in confirming the diagnosis of hypertension.

4,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies only to asymptomatic children whose parents or clinicians do not have specific concerns about their speech, language, hearing, or development. It does not apply to children whose parents or clinicians raise those concerns; these children should undergo evaluation and, if needed, treatment.<br /><br />This recommendation discusses the identification and treatment of &ldquo;primary&rdquo; speech and language delays and disorders (i.e., in children who have not been previously identified with another disorder or disability that may cause speech or language impairment].
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
Information about the prevalence of speech and language delays and disorders in young children in the United States is limited. In 2007, about 2.6% of children ages 3 to 5 years received services for speech and language disabilities under IDEA. <br /><br />Childhood speech and language disorders include a broad set of disorders with heterogeneous outcomes. Information about the natural history of these disorders is limited, because most affected children receive at least some type of intervention. However, there is some evidence that young children with speech and language delay may be at increased risk of language-based learning disabilities.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
The potential harms of screening and interventions for speech and language disorders in young children in primary care include the time, effort, and anxiety associated with further testing after a positive screen, as well as the potential detriments associated with diagnostic labeling. However, the USPSTF found no studies on these harms.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
Surveillance or screening for speech and language disorders is commonly recommended as part of routine developmental surveillance and screening in primary care settings (i.e., during well-child visits).&nbsp;In practice, however, such screening is not universal. The previous evidence review&nbsp;found that 55% of parents reported that their toddler did not receive any type of developmental assessment at their well-child visit, and 30% of parents reported that their child&rsquo;s health care provider had not discussed with them how their child communicates.&nbsp;In a 2009 study, approximately half of responding pediatricians reported that they &ldquo;always or almost always&rdquo; use a standardized screening tool to detect developmental problems in young children; about 40% of respondents reported using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ).&nbsp;The USPSTF distinguishes between screening in primary care settings and diagnostic testing, which may occur in other settings.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
Based on a review of 31 cohort studies, several risk factors have been reported to be associated with speech and language delay and disorders, including male sex, family history of speech and language impairment, low parental education level, and perinatal risk factors (e.g., prematurity, low birth weight, and birth difficulties).
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on specific screening tests for use in primary care. Widely used screening tests in the United States include the ASQ, the Language Development Survey (LDS), and the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CD).<br />
<h3>Interventions</h3>
Interventions for childhood speech and language disorders vary widely and can include speech-language therapy sessions and assistive technology (if indicated). Interventions are commonly individualized to each child&rsquo;s specific pattern of symptoms, needs, interests, personality, and learning style. Treatment plans also incorporate the priorities of the child, parents, and/or teachers. Speech-language therapy may take place in various settings, such as speech and language specialty clinics, the school or classroom, and the home. Therapy may be administered on an individual basis and/or in groups, and may be child-centered and/or include peer and family components. Therapists may be speech-language pathologists, educators, or parents. The duration and intensity of the intervention depend on the severity of the speech or language disorder and the child&rsquo;s progress in meeting therapy goals.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
The USPSTF recommends screening for hearing loss in all newborn infants (B recommendation). The USPSTF is developing a recommendation on screening for autism spectrum disorder in young children. These recommendations are available on the USPSTF Web site (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
All states have designated programs that offer evaluation and intervention services to children ages 0 to 5 years. IDEA is a law that ensures early intervention, special education, and related services for children with disabilities in the United States. Infants and toddlers (birth to age 2 years) with disabilities and their families may receive early intervention services under IDEA part C, whereas children and adolescents (ages 3 to 21 years) may receive special education and related services under IDEA part B.
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
The USPSTF identified several evidence gaps, including a critical need for studies specifically designed and executed to address whether systematic, routine screening for speech and language delay and disorders in young children in primary care settings leads to improved speech, language, or other outcomes. Studies on the feasibility of speech- and language-specific screening as part of routine developmental screening and that identify the most effective screening instruments are needed. Studies on the potential harms of screening and interventions are also needed. <br /><br />Information about the prevalence of speech and language delays and disorders in young children in the United States is lacking. More information about the specific factors associated with intervention effectiveness, including the potential effects of age at diagnosis, age at treatment, treatment type, and treatment duration, is needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/speech-and-language-delay-and-disorders-in-children-age-5-and-younger-screening#Pod5,155,"The American Academy of Pediatrics&nbsp;recommends that developmental surveillance be incorporated at every well-child preventive care visit for children from birth through age 3 years.

<p>Speech and language delays and disorders can pose significant problems for children and their families. Children with speech and language delays develop speech or language in the correct sequence but at a slower rate than expected, whereas children with speech and language disorders develop speech or language that is qualitatively different from typical development. Differentiating between delays and disorders can be complicated. First, screening instruments have difficulty distinguishing between the two. Second, although the majority of school-aged children with language disorders present with language delays as toddlers, some children outgrow their language delay. <br /><br />Information about the prevalence of speech and language delays and disorders in young children in the United States is limited. In 2007, about 2.6% of children ages 3 to 5 years received services for speech and language disabilities under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). In 1 population-based study in 8-year-olds in Utah, the prevalence of children with communication disorders (speech or language) on the basis of special education or&nbsp;<em>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</em>, classifications was 63.4 cases per 1,000 children.&nbsp;The prevalence of isolated communication disorders (i.e., children without a concomitant diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability) was 59.1 cases per 1,000 children.<br /><br />Information on the natural history of speech and language delays and disorders, including how outcomes may change as a result of screening or treatment, is also limited.</p>

5,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults aged 18 years or older who are seen in primary care settings and are not known to have signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended. This recommendation focuses on screening (that is, testing for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults and treating those who are found to have a deficiency), which is different from other USPSTF recommendation statements on supplementation (that is, recommending preventive medication for patients at increased risk for a specific negative health outcome, such as falls, regardless of whether they have a deficiency).<br /><br />The USPSTF recognizes that there is no consensus on how to define vitamin D deficiency and does not endorse the use of a specific threshold to identify it. The evidence reviewed by the USPSTF used varying cut points. For the purposes of this recommendation statement, the term &ldquo;vitamin D deficiency&rdquo; is used to reflect evidence from study populations generally representing total serum 25-(OH)D levels of 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) or less or subpopulations of studies with levels less than 50 nmol/L (&lt;20 ng/mL).
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
Given the lack of consensus on how to define and assess vitamin D deficiency, its precise prevalence estimates are difficult to determine. To collect precise estimates, accurate assay methods, an internationally recognized reference standard, and a specific cut point for defining vitamin D deficiency need to be established. Reported estimates of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency vary widely depending on the period, cut point, study population, study design, and testing method. Estimates range from as low as 19% using a statistical modeling approach&nbsp;to as high as 77% based on NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) data from 2001 to 2004 (using a cut point of &lt;75 nmol/L [&lt;30 ng/mL]).<br /><br />The effect of vitamin D levels on health outcomes is difficult to evaluate. Lower vitamin D levels have been reported to increase risk for fractures, falls, functional limitations, some types of cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and death. However, observations of these associations are inconsistent and may vary by the cut point used to define low vitamin D levels and by subpopulation (defined by race or institutionalization). For example, African Americans have paradoxically lower reported rates of fractures despite having increased prevalence of low vitamin D levels than white persons.<br /><br />If a threshold total serum 25-(OH)D level could be established to define vitamin D deficiency and if testing assays could be standardized, the goal of screening for vitamin D deficiency would be to identify and treat it before associated adverse clinical outcomes occur. However, current evidence is inadequate to determine whether screening for and treatment of asymptomatic low 25-(OH)D levels improve clinical outcomes in community-dwelling adults.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
Screening may misclassify persons with a vitamin D deficiency because of the uncertainty about the cut point for defining deficiency and the variability of available testing assays. Misclassification may result in overdiagnosis (which may lead to nondeficient persons receiving unnecessary treatment) or underdiagnosis (which may lead to deficient persons not receiving treatment).<br /><br />A rare but potential harm of treatment with oral vitamin D is toxicity, which may lead to hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, suppressed parathyroid hormone, and hypercalciuria. However, the 25-(OH)D level associated with toxicity (often defined as &gt;500 nmol/L [&gt;200 ng/mL])&nbsp;is well above the level considered to be sufficient. Treatment with vitamin D plus calcium may also be associated with increased risk for kidney stones; vitamin D alone does not seem to increase this risk. In general, treatment with oral vitamin D does not seem to be associated with serious harms. Treatment with increased sun exposure (specifically ultraviolet B [UVB] radiation) may increase risk for skin cancer. Because of this concern, increased sun exposure is generally not recommended as treatment of vitamin D deficiency.
<h4>Costs</h4>
Several vitamin D testing methods are available; the cost of screening varies.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
Testing rates for vitamin D levels seem to be increasing, despite the uncertainty about the definition of deficiency. Although estimates of screening rates in primary care settings are not available, a recent study evaluating data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey found that the annual rate of outpatient visits associated with a diagnosis code for vitamin D deficiency more than tripled between 2008 and 2010 (1177 visits per 100,000 population in 2010).&nbsp;In addition, according to a 2009 survey, total serum 25-(OH)D testing increased by at least 50% compared with the previous year in more than half of the clinical laboratories surveyed.<br /><br />
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
Although there is not enough evidence to support screening for vitamin D deficiency, some evidence suggests factors that may increase risk for vitamin D deficiency. Persons with low vitamin D intake, decreased vitamin D absorption, and little or no sun exposure (for example, due to the winter season, high latitude, or physical sun avoidance) may be at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency.&nbsp;Obesity and darker skin pigmentation may also be associated with low levels of total serum 25-(OH)D, but whether these factors reflect vitamin D deficiency or increase the risk for adverse clinical outcomes is unclear. Obesity may allow for greater sequestration of vitamin D into adipose tissue; however, this vitamin D may still be bioavailable.&nbsp;Increased skin pigmentation reduces the skin's ability to produce vitamin D in response to UVB exposure. Prevalence rates of low total serum 25-(OH)D are 2 to 9 times higher in African Americans and 2 to 3 times higher in Hispanics than in white persons,&nbsp;yet the risk for fractures in African Americans is half that in white persons.&nbsp;Other factors, such as body composition and calcium economy, have been proposed to explain this paradox;&nbsp;however, a recent study suggests that although total serum 25-(OH)D levels in African Americans may be low, the concentration of bioavailable 25-(OH)D may not be.&nbsp;Some evidence suggests that older age and female sex may also be associated with increased risk for vitamin D deficiency; however, these findings are inconsistent.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Current vitamin D assays measure total serum 25-(OH)D levels to determine vitamin D status (that is, whether a person is considered to have or not have a deficiency). Many testing methods are available, including competitive protein binding, immunoassay, high-performance liquid chromatography, and combined high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. However, the sensitivity and specificity of these tests are unknown because of the lack of studies that use an internationally recognized reference standard. Variability between assay methods and between laboratories using the same methods may range from 10% to 20%, and classification of samples as &ldquo;deficient&rdquo; or &ldquo;nondeficient&rdquo; may vary by 4% to 32%, depending on which assay is used.&nbsp;Another factor that may complicate interpretation is that 25-(OH)D may act as a negative acute-phase reactant and its levels may decrease in response to inflammation. Lastly, whether common laboratory reference ranges are appropriate for all ethnic groups is unclear.
<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>
Oral vitamin D is most often used to treat vitamin D deficiency; other treatment options include increasing dietary vitamin D intake or UVB exposure. Commonly available forms of oral vitamin D include vitamin D3&nbsp;(cholecalciferol) and vitamin D2&nbsp;(ergocalciferol).
<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>
According to the Institute of Medicine, daily dietary vitamin D intake of 600 IU in adults aged 18 to 70 years and 800 IU in adults older than 70 years should be sufficient to meet the needs of 97.5% of the adult population.&nbsp;Ultraviolet B exposure may also increase vitamin D levels; however, several variables (such as the time of day, season, cloud cover, skin pigmentation, and sunscreen use) can affect the length of exposure needed to attain sufficient vitamin D levels. Sun exposure to prevent vitamin D deficiency is not generally recommended because it increases the risk for skin cancer associated with UVB radiation.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The USPSTF has published recommendations on the use of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of falls and fractures and vitamin supplementation for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer (available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>). These recommendations differ from the current recommendation statement in that they address vitamin D supplementation in certain populations at high risk for falls, fractures, cardiovascular disease, or cancer without first determining a patient's vitamin D status.
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
The lack of an accurate screening strategy to identify vitamin D deficiency, especially in important subpopulations (such as African Americans), is a critical gap in the evidence. Further research is needed to determine the cut point that defines vitamin D deficiency, the sensitivity and specificity of various assays using an internationally accepted reference standard, and whether total serum 25-(OH)D is the best measure of vitamin D deficiency in all populations. The possible effects of acute inflammation on vitamin D levels also needs further investigation. More studies are also needed to evaluate which treatment regimens may benefit specific vitamin D&ndash;deficient populations, such as men and non-Caucasian ethnic groups, who are absent from the evidence base. Lastly, further studies are needed to evaluate the harms of screening for and treatment of vitamin D deficiency. One ongoing trial, VITAL (VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL), may provide some answers in the near future. This large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is designed to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease in a multiethnic study population. Furthermore, because a large portion of the study population will have baseline 25-(OH)D levels measured, the study may provide information on whether supplementation in vitamin D&ndash;deficient populations is beneficial.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vitamin-d-deficiency-screening#Pod5,154,"No national primary care professional organization currently recommends population-wide screening for vitamin D deficiency. The American Academy of Family Physicians concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency.&nbsp;The Endocrine Society recommends screening for vitamin D deficiency only in persons at risk and states that there is no evidence showing benefits of screening at a population level.&nbsp;It defines vitamin D deficiency as total serum 25-(OH)D levels of less than 50 nmol/L (&lt;20 ng/mL) and vitamin D insufficiency as 52.5 to 72.5 nmol/L (21 to 29 ng/mL) and recommends treatment of persons with a vitamin D deficiency. Other organizations, including the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,&nbsp;the American Geriatric Society,&nbsp;and the National Osteoporosis Foundation,&nbsp;recommend testing for vitamin D as part of osteoporosis management or falls prevention. The Institute of Medicine does not have formal guidelines on screening for vitamin D deficiency, but it has published a report on the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D.&nbsp;The RDA is the estimated requirement to meet or exceed the vitamin D needs of 97.5% of the adult population. Assuming minimal sun exposure, the Institute of Medicine&rsquo;s RDA for vitamin D is 600 IU/day for adults aged 19 to 70 years and 800 IU/day for adults older than 70 years. Furthermore, it concluded that total serum 25-(OH)D levels of 40 nmol/L (16 ng/mL) meet the needs of approximately half of the population, and levels of 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) or greater meet the needs of nearly all of the population. However, it is not necessary to evaluate 25-(OH)D levels before discussing RDA with patients.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vitamin-d-deficiency-screening#Pod8,"<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>No consensus exists on the definition of vitamin D deficiency or the optimal level of total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25-(OH)D] (the major form of vitamin D that circulates in the body). Depending on which cut point is used (usually &lt;50 or &lt;75 nmol/L [&lt;20 or &lt;30 ng/mL]), some studies have shown that low levels of vitamin D are associated with increased risk for fractures, functional limitations, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and death.</p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>Many testing methods are available that measure total serum 25-(OH)D levels. However, the accuracy of these tests to detect vitamin D deficiency is difficult to determine because of the lack of studies that use an internationally recognized reference standard and the lack of consensus on the laboratory values that define vitamin D deficiency. The USPSTF found evidence suggesting that results vary by testing method and between laboratories using the same testing methods.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found no studies that evaluated the direct benefit of screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that treatment of asymptomatic vitamin D deficiency has no benefit on cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, risk for death in community-dwelling adults, and risk for fractures in persons not selected on the basis of being at high risk for fractures. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefit of treatment of asymptomatic vitamin D deficiency on other outcomes, including psychosocial and physical functioning. Although the evidence is adequate for a few limited outcomes, the overall evidence on the early treatment of asymptomatic, screen-detected vitamin D deficiency in adults to improve overall health outcomes is inadequate.</p>
<h3>Harms of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found no studies that evaluated the direct harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of treatment of vitamin D deficiency are small to none.

6,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to children ages 6 to 24 months living in the United States who are asymptomatic for iron deficiency anemia. It does not apply to children younger than age 6 months or older than 24 months, children who are severely malnourished, children who were born prematurely or with low birth weight, or children who have symptoms of iron deficiency anemia. Recommendations regarding screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women and iron supplementation during pregnancy are addressed in a separate recommendation statement (available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
Estimates of the prevalence of iron deficiency in children ages 1 to 3 years in the United States range from 8% to 14%, and approximately one third of these children also have anemia.&nbsp;Based on 1999 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, the estimated prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in children ages 12 to 35 months is 2.1%.&nbsp;Several factors have been identified that may increase a child&rsquo;s risk for iron deficiency anemia, including prematurity or low birth weight, use of non&ndash;iron-fortified formula or introduction to cow's milk in the first year of life, and exclusive breastfeeding without regular intake of iron-fortified food after age 6 months. Demographic factors associated with increased risk for iron deficiency anemia include low socioeconomic status and having parents who are migrant workers or recent immigrants. Additional factors that may be associated with increased risk for iron deficiency in children include weight and height in the 95th percentile or greater, bottle feeding beyond the first year of life, having a mother who is currently pregnant, or living in an urban area. Evidence on whether Hispanic ethnicity increases children's risk for iron deficiency has been mixed, with some studies showing an increased risk and others showing no increased risk. Older data from NHANES (1988&ndash;1994) showed that Mexican American children were nearly 3 times more likely than white children to have iron deficiency, whereas more recent NHANES data from 1999&ndash;2002 found no increased risk in Hispanic children.&nbsp;The USPSTF found no studies that assessed the performance of risk assessment tools to identify children who are at increased risk for iron deficiency anemia. <br /><br />Some observational studies suggest that iron deficiency anemia in early childhood may be associated with neurodevelopmental and behavioral delays and poorer performance on cognitive tests. However, concluding that there is a direct causal link between iron deficiency anemia and these outcomes is difficult because of the methodological flaws in these studies and potential confounding due to underlying nutritional and socioeconomic differences between groups.&nbsp;The aim of screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children is to identify and treat anemia before it leads to poor child health outcomes.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
The harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia have not been well studied. Potential harms of screening include false-positive results, anxiety, and cost. Reported adverse events of treatment with iron include limited gastrointestinal symptoms, darkening color of stool, staining of teeth and gums, and drug interactions with other medications. The previous USPSTF recommendation also noted that accidental iron overdose can occur in children receiving treatment or supplementation with iron.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
No recent nationally representative data on the current rate of screening are available.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Although the evidence is insufficient to recommend specific tests for screening, measurement of serum hemoglobin or hematocrit is often the first step.
<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>
In the United States, iron deficiency anemia in children is usually treated with oral iron. The usual dose in infants and young children is 3 to 6 mg/kg of elemental iron per day in 2 to 3 divided doses.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
According to the Institute of Medicine, the Recommended Dietary Allowance for iron in infants ages 7 to 12 months is 11 mg per day. In children ages 1 to 3 years, the Recommended Dietary Allowance is 7 mg per day. Natural food sources of iron include certain fruits, vegetables, meat, and poultry. The Institute of Medicine also notes that nonheme iron, which is found in vegetarian diets, may be less well absorbed than heme iron, which is found in diets containing meat; therefore, the iron requirement may be almost twice as much in children who eat a purely vegetarian diet.&nbsp;Fortified breads and grain products (such as cereal) are also good sources of iron for young children eating solid foods.&nbsp;Iron-fortified formula is another source of iron for infants. Federally regulated iron fortification of food products in the United States began in 1941, and the iron content in enriched grain products has increased over the years.&nbsp;More than 50% of the iron in the U.S. food supply comes from iron-fortified cereal grain products.

<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Although iron deficiency anemia has been associated with neurodevelopmental and cognitive impairments and behavioral delays based on observational data, studies that show an improvement in these health outcomes through treatment are lacking. Studies that evaluate the effects (short- and long-term) of change in iron status on health outcomes in settings similar to the United States with respect to nutrition, hemoparasite burden, and socioeconomic status are needed.

<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
Based on older data, estimates of the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women in the United States range from 2% to 27%, with higher rates in later trimesters and minority populations.&nbsp;Based on calculations of total body iron from 1999 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, the estimated prevalence of iron deficiency in pregnant women is 18.6%; of these, 16.2% also have anemia.&nbsp;However, given the physiologic hemodilution that normally occurs during the later stages of pregnancy, determining exact prevalence rates of anemia in pregnant women may be difficult.<br /><br />Several factors have been identified that may increase a pregnant woman&rsquo;s risk for iron deficiency anemia, including a diet lacking in iron-rich foods (for example, a vegetarian diet with inadequate sources of iron), gastrointestinal disease and/or medications that can decrease iron absorption (for example, antacids), and a short interval between pregnancies. Non-Hispanic black and Mexican American women have higher prevalence rates of iron deficiency than white women and women with parity of 2 or more. Evidence on additional risk factors, such as lower educational level and family income, has been less consistent. On the basis of a literature scan, the USPSTF found limited evidence on the use of risk prediction tools to identify pregnant women who are at increased risk for iron deficiency anemia.<br /><br />&nbsp;Many observational studies have explored the association between adverse maternal and infant health outcomes (such as postpartum hemorrhage, preterm birth, low birthweight, and perinatal death) and iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy, but findings have been inconclusive.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
The harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia have not been well-studied but are likely minor. Potential harms of screening include false-positive results, anxiety, and cost. Reported adverse events of iron supplementation or treatment with iron include limited gastrointestinal symptoms, darkening color of urine or stool, staining of teeth and gums, and drug interactions with other medications.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
Rates of screening for iron deficiency anemia and iron supplementation in pregnant women by clinicians are not well-documented. However, based on anecdotal evidence, it is probably common. In addition, there may be other reasons to screen for anemia in pregnant women, such as to prepare for cesarean delivery or anticipated blood loss during a complicated delivery. Older data from 1988 show that 97% of pregnant women who received prenatal care reported being advised to take a multivitamin&ndash;mineral supplement.&nbsp;Based on 1996 to 2006 NHANES data, 77% of pregnant women reported using a supplement within the previous 30 days and they most frequently used a multivitamin containing 48 mg of iron.

Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women is similar to that in nonpregnant women and includes additional iron intake through oral iron pills, prenatal vitamins, and diet. The usual dose is 60 to 120 mg of elemental iron per day.&nbsp;Intravenous iron treatment is also used during pregnancy.
<h3>Supplementation</h3>
Prenatal vitamins often include a low dose of iron; the usual dose prescribed in early pregnancy is 30 mg of elemental iron per day. Higher doses (60 to 100 mg of elemental iron per day) are sometimes prescribed in populations at increased risk for iron deficiency anemia.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
<h4>Dietary Iron</h4>
According to the Institute of Medicine, the Recommended Dietary Allowance for iron in pregnant women is 27 mg per day. Natural food sources of iron include certain fruits, vegetables, meat, and poultry. The Institute of Medicine also notes that nonheme iron, which is found in vegetarian diets, may be less well-absorbed than heme iron, which is found in diets containing meat; therefore, the iron requirement may be almost twice as much in women who eat a purely vegetarian diet.<br /><br />Fortified breads and grain products (such as cereal) are also important potential sources of iron.&nbsp;Federally regulated iron fortification of U.S. food products began in 1941, and the iron content in enriched grain products has increased over the years.&nbsp;It is estimated that more than 50% of the iron in the U.S. food supply comes from iron-fortified cereal grain products.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The USPSTF has published separate recommendation statements on screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children and folic acid supplementation during pregnancy (available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).<br />
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Studies that directly evaluate the effects of screening for and early treatment of iron deficiency anemia on maternal and infant health outcomes are needed. Although adequate evidence shows that iron supplementation improves maternal hematologic indexes, the clinical significance of this improvement needs to be defined. Well-designed and adequately powered studies that evaluate the effects of iron supplementation, or change in maternal iron status as a result of intervention, on maternal and infant health outcomes (for example, postpartum hemorrhage, maternal illness, preterm delivery, low birthweight, and perinatal death) are needed, particularly in settings similar to the United States with respect to nutrition, hemoparasite burden, and socioeconomic status.
<h3>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</h3>
This recommendation is consistent with the 2006 recommendation statement on iron supplementation during pregnancy. Both the 2006 and the current recommendation statements found insufficient evidence to determine the balance of the benefits and harms of iron supplementation during pregnancy. Although the 2006 statement recommended screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women, the current recommendation found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening. In its review of the evidence to update the 2006 recommendation, the USPSTF found no good- or fair-quality studies on the benefits or harms of screening that would be applicable to the current U.S. population of pregnant women. Since 2006, the USPSTF has updated its methodology to better identify evidence that would be most applicable to the current U.S. population. Therefore, the USPSTF determined that the currently available and applicable evidence on screening for and early treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women is insufficient.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/iron-deficiency-anemia-in-pregnant-women-screening-and-supplementation#Pod5,156,"In 1998, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended screening for anemia and initiating low-dose iron supplementation at the first prenatal care visit for all pregnant women.&nbsp;The Institute of Medicine recommends screening for anemia in each trimester of pregnancy.&nbsp;The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends screening all pregnant women for anemia and treating those with iron deficiency anemia with supplemental iron. It also states that whether iron supplementation in well-nourished pregnant women without anemia affects perinatal outcomes is unclear.&nbsp;Consistent with the USPSTF, the American Academy of Family Physicians concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women to prevent adverse maternal health and birth outcomes.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/iron-deficiency-anemia-in-pregnant-women-screening-and-supplementation#Pod6,"<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>The aims of iron supplementation or screening for and treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women are to improve maternal and infant health outcomes. Few data are available to estimate the current prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women in the United States. Based on older data from 1999 to 2006, an estimated 18.6% of pregnant women have iron deficiency; of those, an estimated 16.2% have anemia.&nbsp;Rates may be higher in low-income and minority populations.</p>
<h3>Detection and Recognition of Risk Status</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that specifically addressed the accuracy of screening tests in asymptomatic pregnant women. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to evaluate risk prediction tools to identify pregnant women who are at increased risk for iron deficiency anemia.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>
<h4>Screening</h4>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on screening for iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic pregnant women. No studies evaluated the direct effects of routine screening in asymptomatic pregnant women on maternal health or birth outcomes. The USPSTF also found inadequate evidence on the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women because none of the recent studies on treatment were generalizable to the general U.S. population. This represents a critical gap in the evidence.</p>
<h4>Preventive Medication</h4>
<p>Overall, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the effect of routine iron supplementation during pregnancy on maternal health or birth outcomes, such as maternal iron deficiency anemia, cesarean delivery, preterm delivery, infant mortality, or low birthweight. Several studies reported inconsistent findings on these health outcomes. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that routine iron supplementation during pregnancy improves intermediate maternal hematologic indexes, such as serum ferritin and hemoglobin levels. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that routine iron supplementation during pregnancy has no effects on the length of gestation and infant Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes.</p>
<h4>Change in Iron Status</h4>
<p>No studies were found that directly assessed the association between change in iron status as a result of treatment or supplementation and improvement in maternal or infant health outcomes. This represents a critical gap in the evidence.</p>
<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>
<h4>Screening</h4>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of routine screening for iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic pregnant women. No studies were found that evaluated the harms of routine screening on maternal health or birth outcomes. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women; no recent studies were generalizable to the current general U.S. population.</p>
<h4>Preventive Medication</h4>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the magnitude of the harms of routine iron supplementation in pregnant women is small to none. Several studies assessed the harms of iron supplementation in pregnant women. Most reported no statistically significant increase in harms. Of the harms reported, most were self-limited and transient effects of treatment, such as nausea, constipation, and diarrhea.</p>
<h4>USPSTF Assessment</h4>

The results of the meta-analysis of clinical trials from the systematic evidence review commissioned by the USPSTF are summarized in<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab1"">Table 1</a>. Over a 10-year period, screening 10,000 women aged 60 to 69 years will result in 21 (95% CI, 11 to 32) fewer breast cancer deaths. The benefit is smaller in younger women: screening 10,000 women aged 50 to 59 years will result in 8 (CI, 2 to 17) fewer breast cancer deaths, and screening 10,000 women aged 40 to 49 years will result in 3 (CI, 0 to 9) fewer breast cancer deaths.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2"">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation3"">3</a>&nbsp;Most of these trials began enrollment more than 30 years ago, and these estimates may not reflect the current likelihood of avoiding a breast cancer death with contemporary screening mammography technology. Mammography imaging has since improved, which may result in more tumors being detected at a curable stage today than at the time of these trials. However, breast cancer treatments have also improved, and as treatment improves, the advantage of earlier detection decreases, so that some of the women who died of breast cancer in the nonscreened groups in these trials would survive today.
<h3>Harms of Screening</h3>
The most important harm of screening is the detection and treatment of invasive and noninvasive cancer that would never have been detected, or threaten health, in the absence of screening (overdiagnosis and overtreatment). Existing science does not allow for the ability to determine precisely what proportion of cancer diagnosed by mammography today reflects overdiagnosis, and estimates vary widely depending on the data source and method of calculation used.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2"">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation4"">4</a>&nbsp;In the United States, the rate of diagnosis of invasive plus noninvasive breast cancer increased by 50% during the era of mammography screening (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#fig"">Figure</a>).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation5"">5</a>&nbsp;It is not possible to know with certainty what proportion of that increase is due to overdiagnosis and what proportion reflects other reasons for a rising incidence. If overdiagnosis is the only explanation for the increase, 1 in 3 women diagnosed with breast cancer today is being treated for cancer that would never have been discovered or caused her health problems in the absence of screening. The best estimates from randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of mammography screening on breast cancer mortality suggest that 1 in 5 women diagnosed with breast cancer over approximately 10 years will be overdiagnosed.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation6"">6</a>&nbsp;Modeling studies conducted in support of this recommendation by the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) provide a range of estimates that reflect different underlying assumptions; the median estimate is that 1 in 8 women diagnosed with breast cancer with biennial screening from ages 50 to 74 years will be overdiagnosed. The rate increases with an earlier start age or with annual mammography.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation7"">7</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation8"">8</a>&nbsp;Even with the conservative estimate of 1 in 8 breast cancer cases being overdiagnosed, for every woman who avoids a death from breast cancer through screening, 2 to 3 women will be treated unnecessarily. <br /><br />The other principal harms of screening are false-positive results, which require further imaging and often breast biopsy, and false-negative results.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab2"">Table 2</a>&nbsp;summarizes the rates of these harms per screening round using registry data for digital mammography from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC), a collaborative network of 5 mammography registries and 2 affiliated sites with linkages to tumor registries across the United States.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2"">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation9"">9</a>&nbsp;(Note that&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab2"">Table 2</a>&nbsp;describes a different time horizon than&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab1"">Table 1</a>&nbsp;[per screening round rather than per decade]).
<h3>When to Start Screening</h3>
Clinical trials, observational studies, and modeling studies all demonstrate that the likelihood of avoiding a breast cancer death with regular screening mammography increases with age, and this increase in benefit likely occurs gradually rather than abruptly at any particular age. In contrast, the harms of screening mammography either remain constant or decrease with age. For example, about the same number of breast biopsies are performed as a result of screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years as in those aged 60 to 69 years, but many more of these biopsies will result in a diagnosis of invasive cancer in the older age group. Thus, the balance of benefit and harms improves with age (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab3"">Table 3</a>). <br /><br />The USPSTF concludes that while there are harms of mammography, the benefit of screening mammography outweighs the harms by at least a moderate amount from age 50 to 74 years and is greatest for women in their 60s. For women in their 40s, the number who benefit from starting regular screening mammography is smaller and the number experiencing harm is larger compared with older women. For women in their 40s, the benefit still outweighs the harms, but to a smaller degree; this balance may therefore be more subject to individual values and preferences than it is in older women. Women in their 40s must weigh a very important but infrequent benefit (reduction in breast cancer deaths) against a group of meaningful and more common harms (overdiagnosis and overtreatment, unnecessary and sometimes invasive follow-up testing and psychological harms associated with false-positive test results, and false reassurance from false-negative test results). Women who value the possible benefit of screening mammography more than they value avoiding its harms can make an informed decision to begin screening. <br /><br />Neither clinical trials nor models can precisely predict the potential benefits and harms that an individual woman can expect from beginning screening at age 40 rather than 50 years, as these data represent population effects. However, model results may be the easiest way for women to visualize the relative tradeoffs of beginning screening at age 40 versus 50 years. CISNET conducted modeling studies to predict the lifetime benefits and harms of screening with contemporary digital mammography at different starting and stopping ages and screening intervals. The models varied their assumptions about the natural history of invasive and noninvasive breast cancer and the effect of detection by digital mammography on survival. The models assumed the ideal circumstances of perfect adherence to screening and current best practices for therapy across the life span.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab3"">Table 3</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>compares the median and range across the models for predicted lifetime benefits and harms of screening biennially from ages 50 to 74 years with screening biennially from ages 40 to 74 years. (Note that&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab3"">Table 3</a>&nbsp;differs from Tables&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab1"">1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab2"">2</a>&nbsp;in terms of population metrics [per 1000 vs. 10,000 women] and time horizon considered [lifetime vs. 10-year or single event]). <br /><br />It is, however, a false dichotomy to assume that the only options are to begin screening at age 40 or to wait until age 50 years. As women advance through their 40s, the incidence of breast cancer rises. The balance of benefit and harms may also shift accordingly over this decade, such that women in the latter half of the decade likely have a more favorable balance than women in the first half. Indeed, the CISNET models suggest that most of the benefit of screening women aged 40 to 49 years would be realized by starting screening at age 45.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation7"">7</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation8"">8</a>
<h3>Risk Factors That May Influence When to Start Screening</h3>
Advancing age is the most important risk factor for breast cancer in most women, but epidemiologic data from the BCSC suggest that having a first-degree relative with breast cancer is associated with an approximately 2-fold increased risk for breast cancer in women aged 40 to 49 years.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2"">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation9"">9</a>&nbsp;Further, the CISNET models suggest that for women with about a 2-fold increased risk for breast cancer, starting annual digital screening at age 40 years results in a similar harm-to-benefit ratio (based on number of false-positive results or overdiagnosed cases per 1000 breast cancer deaths avoided) as beginning biennial digital screening at age 50 years in average-risk women.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation7"">7</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation8"">8</a>&nbsp;This approach has not been formally tested in a clinical trial; therefore, there is no direct evidence that it would result in net benefit similar to that of women aged 50 to 74 years. However, given the increased burden of disease and potential likelihood of benefit, women aged 40 to 49 years who have a known first-degree relative (parent, child, or sibling) with breast cancer may consider initiating screening earlier than age 50 years. Many other risk factors have been associated with breast cancer in epidemiologic studies, but most of these relationships are weak or inconsistent and would not likely influence how women value the tradeoffs of the potential benefits and harms of screening. Risk calculators, such as the National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (available at<a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/BCRISKTOOL"" target=""_blank"">www.cancer.gov/BCRISKTOOL</a><a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/exit-disclaimer"" title=""This link goes offsite.

Click to read the external link disclaimer</a>), have good calibration between predicted and actual outcomes in groups of women but are not accurate at predicting an individual woman&rsquo;s risk for breast cancer.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation10"">10</a>
<h3>How Often to Screen</h3>
Once a woman has decided to begin screening, the next decision is how often to undergo screening. No clinical trials compared annual mammography with a longer interval in women of any age. In the randomized trials that demonstrated the effectiveness of mammography in reducing breast cancer deaths in women aged 40 to 74 years, screening intervals ranged from 12 to 33 months.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2"">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation3"">3</a>&nbsp;There was no clear trend for greater benefit in trials of annual mammography, but other differences between the trials preclude certainty that no difference in benefit exists. Available observational evidence evaluating the effects of varying mammography intervals found no difference in the number of breast cancer deaths between women aged 50 years or older who were screened biennially versus annually.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2"">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation3"">3</a> <br /><br />Regardless of the starting age for screening, the models consistently predict a small incremental increase in the number of breast cancer deaths averted when moving from biennial to annual mammography, but also a large increase in the number of harms (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#tab4"">Table 4</a>).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation7"">7</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation8"">8</a>&nbsp;The USPSTF concludes that for most women, biennial mammography screening provides the best overall balance of benefit and harms.
<h3>When to Consider Stopping Screening</h3>
Clinical trial data for women aged 70 to 74 years are inconclusive. In its 2009 recommendation,<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation11"">11</a>&nbsp;the USPSTF extended the recommendation for screening mammography to age 74 years based on the extrapolation that much of the benefit seen in women aged 60 to 69 years should continue in this age range, and modeling done at the time supported this assumption. Current CISNET models suggest that women aged 70 to 74 years with moderate to severe comorbid conditions that negatively affect their life expectancy are unlikely to benefit from mammography.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation7"">7</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation8"">8</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation12"">12</a>&nbsp;Moderate comorbid conditions include cardiovascular disease, paralysis, and diabetes. Severe comorbid conditions include (but are not limited to) AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, chronic renal failure, dementia, congestive heart failure, and combinations of moderate comorbid conditions, as well as myocardial infarction, ulcer, and rheumatologic disease.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation12"">12</a>
<h3>Screening in Women Aged 75 Years or Older</h3>
The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women aged 75 years or older. CISNET models suggest that biennial mammography screening may potentially continue to offer a net benefit after age 74 years among women with no or low comorbidity,<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation7"">7</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation8"">8</a>&nbsp;but no randomized trials of screening included women in this age group.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation2"">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation3"">3</a>
<h3>DBT as a Primary Screening Strategy</h3>
The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of DBT as a primary screening method for breast cancer.
<h4>Background</h4>
Evidence on DBT is limited; a single study on the test characteristics of DBT as a primary screening strategy for breast cancer met the inclusion criteria of the systematic evidence review.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation13"">13</a>
<h4>Potential Benefits</h4>
From the limited data available, DBT seems to reduce recall rates (that is, follow-up for additional imaging or testing) and increase cancer detection rates compared with conventional digital mammography alone.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation13"">13</a>&nbsp;However, current study designs cannot determine whether all of the additional cases of cancer detected would have become clinically significant (that is, the degree of overdiagnosis) or whether there is an incremental clinical benefit to detecting these cancers earlier than with conventional digital mammography. In addition, no studies of DBT looked at clinical outcomes, such as breast cancer morbidity or mortality or quality of life.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation13"">13</a>
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
As currently practiced in most settings, DBT exposes women to approximately twice the amount of radiation as conventional digital mammography.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation13"">13</a>&nbsp;In 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a method to generate synthetic reconstruction of 2-dimensional images from 3-dimensional views, which reduces the total radiation dose associated with DBT. Although the extent to which this new software technology has been implemented in mammography screening centers is not precisely known, it is currently thought to be low. In women with abnormal findings, DBT may also increase the rate of breast biopsy compared with conventional digital mammography.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation13"">13</a>
<h3>Primary and Adjunctive Screening in Women With Dense Breasts</h3>
The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of adjunctive screening for breast cancer using breast ultrasonography, MRI, DBT, or other methods in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram.
<h4>Epidemiology of Dense Breasts</h4>
In the United States, the most commonly used classification system for breast density is the American College of Radiology&rsquo;s Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 4-category scale (a = the breasts are almost entirely fatty; b = there are scattered areas of fibroglandular density; c = the breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses; or d = the breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography). Data from the BCSC indicate that about 25 million women (about 43%) aged 40 to 74 years are classified as having heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts. The proportion of women with dense breasts is highest among those aged 40 to 49 years and decreases with age.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation14"">14</a> <br /><br />Increased breast density is a risk factor for breast cancer. Data from the BCSC indicate that, compared with women with average breast density, women aged 40 to 49 years with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts have a relative risk (RR) of 1.23 for developing invasive breast cancer. For women aged 50 to 64 years with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts, the RR is 1.29, and for women aged 65 to 74 years, it is 1.30.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation7"">7</a>&nbsp;However, women with dense breasts who develop breast cancer do not have an increased risk for dying from the disease, after adjustment for stage, treatment, method of detection, and other risk factors, according to data from the BCSC.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation15"">15</a>
<h4>Primary Screening Test Performance Characteristics</h4>
Increased breast density reduces the sensitivity and specificity of mammography for detecting cancer. A BCSC study of more than 300,000 women found that sensitivity decreased from 87% in the lowest density category to 63% in the highest, and specificity decreased from 96% to 90% as breast density increased.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation16"">16</a> <br /><br />A woman&rsquo;s BI-RADS breast density classification can be inconstant over time. Good-quality studies of U.S. radiologists demonstrate that major recategorization of sequential screening examinations (that is, from &ldquo;dense&rdquo; [c/d] to &ldquo;nondense&rdquo; [a/b] or vice versa) occurs in approximately 13% to 19% of women.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation17"">17</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation18"">18</a>&nbsp;These studies excluded women taking hormone medications or those with other medical conditions that may have resulted in physiologic changes that would explain the difference in breast density classification observed between examinations. Reclassification of breast density status from year to year complicates women&rsquo;s assessment of their underlying breast cancer risk, as well as informed screening and care decisions.
<h4>Primary Screening Frequency</h4>
In 1 BCSC study, biennial screening mammography was associated with greater risk for advanced-stage cancer (stage IIB or greater) (odds ratio, 2.39 [CI, 1.06 to 3.39]) or a breast tumor larger than 20 mm (odds ratio, 2.39 [CI, 1.37 to 3.18]) in women aged 40 to 49 years with extremely dense breasts (BI-RADS category d) compared with annual screening; this risk was not seen in women aged 50 to 74 years.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation19"">19</a>&nbsp;No significant differences in lymph node involvement were observed in either age group. Information about morbidity or mortality end points is not available, so whether these women ultimately fared any differently in their clinical outcomes is not known.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation17"">17</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation19"">19</a> <br /><br />All women aged 40 to 74 years with increased breast density are at increased risk for a false-positive result, an unnecessary breast biopsy, or a false-negative result compared with women with average breast density. Screening more frequently (that is, annually vs. biennially) further increases the probability that a woman will experience one of these screening-related harms. Data from the BCSC indicate that the cumulative probability that a woman aged 40 to 49 years with extremely dense breasts screened annually for a decade will receive a false-positive result is about 69%, compared with about 21% for biennial screening. Similarly, unnecessary breast biopsy rates are 12% for annual screening versus 3% for biennial screening.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation17"">17</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation18"">18</a>
<h4>Adjunctive Screening</h4>
<strong>Potential benefits.</strong>&nbsp;Current evidence on adjunctive screening is very limited, but it suggests that for women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative mammogram, ultrasonography or MRI will detect additional breast cancer but will also result in a higher number of false-positive results. Data on DBT in women with dense breasts are limited, but in the short term, DBT also detects additional breast cancer. Most of the additional cancer detected by these methods are invasive tumors rather than ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation17"">17</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation18"">18</a>&nbsp;A short-term increase in the number of cancer cases detected does not allow for the conclusion that adjunctive screening reduces treatment-related morbidity or breast cancer deaths or improves women&rsquo;s quality of life. Although adjunctive screening may detect more breast cancer, these cancers may fall into 1 of 3 categories: 1) those for which earlier detection leads to improved outcomes, 2) those that would have had the same outcome when detected later, or 3) those that are overdiagnosed and would not have caused a health problem during a woman&rsquo;s lifetime and may result in harms from unnecessary treatment. Existing data do not allow for estimation of the proportion of cancer that falls into each category; therefore, the benefits on health cannot be estimated. <br /><br /><strong>Potential harms.</strong>&nbsp;Most positive adjunctive breast cancer screening test results are false positive. Compared with mammography alone, adjunctive screening with ultrasonography or MRI seems to increase recall and biopsy rates. Data on the effects of DBT on recall and biopsy rates in women with dense breasts are too limited to draw conclusions.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation17"">17</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation18"">18</a>&nbsp;The effects of DBT on overdiagnosis rates are unknown. <br /><br /><strong>Current practice.</strong>&nbsp;At the present time, 24 states require patient notification of breast density status when mammography is performed; in some states, legislation also includes language to be sent to women informing them that they should consider adjunctive screening.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation17"">17</a>No clinical practice guidelines explicitly recommend adjunctive screening in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation17"">17</a>
<h4>Assessment</h4>
Increased breast density is very common. It is an independent risk factor for developing (but not dying of) breast cancer, and it reduces mammography&rsquo;s ability to find and accurately identify breast cancer. Many women will move between &ldquo;dense&rdquo; and &ldquo;nondense&rdquo; breast classifications with sequential screening mammograms, and these reclassifications are not primarily due to physiologic causes. More evidence is needed to better understand how the frequency of screening might affect important health outcomes in women with dense breasts. Overall, many important questions remain about the potential role of breast density in individualizing screening approaches, and the current evidence is insufficient to recommend a specific screening strategy for women with increased breast density.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
The USPSTF has made recommendations about the use of medications to reduce women&rsquo;s risk for breast cancer, as well as risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for&nbsp;<em>BRCA1-</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>BRCA2</em>-related cancer (including breast cancer). These recommendations are available on the USPSTF Web site (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#Pod6,159,"<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Trial data are too limited to directly inform the question of what the best screening strategy is for women or how clinicians can best tailor that strategy to the individual. Overdiagnosis and resulting overtreatment of breast cancer that would otherwise not have become a threat to a woman&rsquo;s health during her lifetime is the most important harm associated with breast cancer screening. Because it is impossible to determine for any individual patient whether a diagnosed cancer will or will not progress, measurements of overdiagnosis are not straightforward but rather are indirectly quantified. Current estimates of the magnitude of overdiagnosis associated with mammography screening vary widely. Researchers in the field must work together to critically evaluate and ultimately agree on uniform definitions and standards to optimally measure and monitor overdiagnosis and overtreatment in breast cancer screening programs. In addition, research is critically needed to identify ways to reduce the occurrence of overdiagnosis and subsequent overtreatment associated with breast cancer screening. Ductal carcinoma in situ is an example of a breast lesion with the potential for high rates of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Before the widespread use of screening mammography, 6 cases of DCIS per 100,000 U.S. women per year were identified compared with 37 cases of DCIS per 100,000 women per year after its introduction.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation5"">5</a>&nbsp;When classified as cancer, DCIS now accounts for about 1 in 4 of all breast cancer diagnosed in a given year.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation20"">20</a>&nbsp;However, its nomenclature has recently been the subject of debate, because by definition, DCIS is confined to the mammary ductal&ndash;lobular system and is incapable of metastasis (that is, it is noninvasive and thus lacks the classic characteristic of cancer).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation21"">21</a>&nbsp;Ductal carcinoma in situ may therefore be more appropriately classified as a risk factor for future development of cancer; the primary goal in its management is to reduce the incidence of new invasive carcinoma. The natural history of DCIS&mdash;particularly screen-detected DCIS&mdash;is poorly understood. Although a substantial proportion of these lesions will not progress to invasive cancer,<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation22"">22</a>&nbsp;which women will and which will not develop such cancer cannot be predicted with certainty. As such, nearly all women diagnosed with DCIS receive treatment (generally either mastectomy or lumpectomy with or without radiation; a chemopreventive agent, such as tamoxifen, may also be offered).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation23"">23</a>&nbsp;The 20-year breast cancer mortality rate after treatment of DCIS is as low as 3%;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation24"">24</a>&nbsp;whether this is due to the effectiveness of the interventions or the fact that most DCIS cases being treated are essentially benign is a pressing research question. Research is needed to develop better prognostic indicators to distinguish nonprogressive or slowly progressive lesions from tumors that are likely to affect quality or length of life. Research is also needed to compare the long-term benefits and harms of immediate treatment versus observation or surveillance with delayed intervention in women with screen-detected DCIS. Most of the available screening trials and high-quality cohort studies were performed in Europe and predominately enrolled white women younger than age 70 years. Direct evidence about any differential effectiveness of breast cancer screening is lacking for important subgroups of women, such as African American women, who are at increased risk for dying of breast cancer, and older women, for whom balancing the potential benefits and harms of screening may become increasingly challenging with advancing age. Newer technologies, such as DBT for primary screening or ultrasonography and MRI for adjunctive screening in women with dense breasts, are being increasingly used in the United States without clear evidence to demonstrate their effectiveness in improving important health outcomes. Such studies are necessary prerequisites for the appropriate incorporation of these methods into established screening programs.Finally, a large proportion of women in the United States are classified as having dense breasts after screening mammography. Increased breast density is common in the general population; however, critical questions remain about how best to manage this condition and to support these women. Research to help improve the validity and reproducibility of serial BI-RADS assessments would be useful if breast density is to be considered as a factor for personalized, risk-based approaches to breast cancer screening. In addition, long-term randomized trials or longitudinal cohort studies are needed that compare screening outcomes in women with dense breasts who are not otherwise at increased risk for breast cancer who receive adjunctive screening versus those who do not and report important outcomes, such as breast cancer stage at diagnosis, breast cancer recurrence rates, rates of overdiagnosis, and most importantly, breast cancer mortality.",,"<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Breast cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States. In 2015, an estimated 232,000 women were diagnosed with the disease and 40,000 women died of it. It is most frequently diagnosed among women aged 55 to 64 years, and the median age of death from breast cancer is 68 years.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1#citation1""><br /></a></p>
<h3>Benefit and Harms of Screening and Early Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that mammography screening reduces breast cancer mortality in women aged 40 to 74 years. The number of breast cancer deaths averted increases with age; women aged 40 to 49 years benefit the least and women aged 60 to 69 years benefit the most. Age is the most important risk factor for breast cancer, and the increased benefit observed with age is at least partly due to the increase in risk. Women aged 40 to 49 years who have a first-degree relative with breast cancer have a risk for breast cancer similar to that of women aged 50 to 59 years without a family history. Direct evidence about the benefits of screening mammography in women aged 75 years or older is lacking.<br /><br />The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for breast cancer with mammography results in harms for women aged 40 to 74 years. The most important harm is the diagnosis and treatment of noninvasive and invasive breast cancer that would otherwise not have become a threat to a woman&rsquo;s health, or even apparent, during her lifetime (that is, overdiagnosis and overtreatment). False-positive results are common and lead to unnecessary and sometimes invasive follow-up testing, with the potential for psychological harms (such as anxiety). False-negative results (that is, missed cancer) also occur and may provide false reassurance. Radiation-induced breast cancer and resulting death can also occur, although the number of both of these events is predicted to be low.<br /><br />The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits and harms of DBT as a primary screening method for breast cancer. Similarly, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits and harms of adjunctive screening for breast cancer using breast ultrasonography, MRI, DBT, or other methods in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram. In both cases, while there is some information about the accuracy of these methods, there is no information on the effects of their use on health outcomes, such as breast cancer incidence, mortality, or overdiagnosis rates.</p>

9,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to adults aged 40 to 70 years seen in primary care settings who do not have symptoms of diabetes and are overweight or obese. The target population includes persons who are most likely to have glucose abnormalities that are associated with increased CVD risk and can be expected to benefit from primary prevention of CVD through risk factor modification.<br /><br />Persons who have a family history of diabetes, have a history of gestational diabetes or polycystic ovarian syndrome, or are members of certain racial/ethnic groups (that is, African Americans, American Indians or Alaskan Natives, Asian Americans, Hispanics or Latinos, or Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders) may be at increased risk for diabetes at a younger age or at a lower body mass index. Clinicians should consider screening earlier in persons with 1 or more of these characteristics.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Glucose abnormalities can be detected by measuring HbA1c&nbsp;or fasting plasma glucose or with an oral glucose tolerance test. The&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/screening-for-abnormal-blood-glucose-and-type-2-diabetes#tab"">Table</a>shows test values for normal glucose metabolism, IFG, IGT, and type 2 diabetes. Hemoglobin A1c&nbsp;is a measure of long-term blood glucose concentration and is not affected by acute changes in glucose levels due to stress or illness. Because HbA1c&nbsp;measurements do not require fasting, they are more convenient than using a fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test. The oral glucose tolerance test is done in the morning in a fasting state; blood glucose concentration is measured 2 hours after ingestion of a 75-g oral glucose load.<br /><br />The diagnosis of IFG, IGT, or type 2 diabetes should be confirmed; repeated testing with the same test on a different day is the preferred method of confirmation.
<h3>Threshold for Behavioral Interventions</h3>
Many studies assessed intensive behavioral interventions for persons at increased CVD risk, but none report a consistent threshold for intervention among persons with abnormal blood glucose. Many studies include persons with multiple risk factors, and CVD risk increases with the number of risk factors and glucose level. Perceived readiness for change and access to appropriate interventions will probably influence treatment recommendations. Although direct evidence that preventing a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes results in improved health outcomes is limited, primary prevention that reduces the chances of a diagnosis may reduce the adverse consequences of disease management. Because the average reduction in glucose levels resulting from intensive behavioral interventions is modest, persons with higher glucose levels may be more likely to benefit and avoid a diabetes diagnosis than those whose glucose levels are closer to normal.
<h3>Type of Intervention</h3>
Behavioral interventions that have an effect on CVD risk and delay or avoid progression of glucose abnormalities to type 2 diabetes combine counseling on a healthful diet and physical activity and are intensive, with multiple contacts over extended periods. The evidence is insufficient to conclude that pharmacologic interventions have the same multifactorial benefits (for example, weight loss or reductions in glucose levels, blood pressure, and lipid levels) as behavioral interventions.
<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>
Evidence on the optimal rescreening interval for adults with an initial normal glucose test result is limited.&nbsp;Cohort and modeling studies suggest that rescreening every 3 years may be a reasonable approach for adults with normal blood glucose levels.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
Because overweight and obesity, physical inactivity, abnormal lipid levels, high blood pressure, and smoking are all modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular events, the USPSTF recommends screening and appropriate interventions for these conditions (available at<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).<br /><br />The USPSTF recommends screening for obesity in adults and offering or referring those with a body mass index of 30 kg/m2&nbsp;or greater to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions. Although intensive interventions may not be practical in many primary care settings, patients can be referred from primary care to community-based programs for these interventions.<br /><br />The USPSTF recommends offering or referring adults who are overweight (body mass index &gt;25 kg/m2) and have additional cardiovascular risk factors to intensive behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity for CVD prevention.<br /><br />The USPSTF recommends screening for lipid disorders in men aged 35 years or older and women aged 45 years or older who are at increased risk for coronary heart disease. <br /><br />The USPSTF also recommends screening for hypertension in adults aged 18 years or older and that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use and provide tobacco cessation interventions to those who use tobacco products.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends combined diet and physical activity promotion programs for persons who are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes. It found that these programs are effective across a range of counseling intensities, settings, and facilitators. Effective programs commonly include setting a weight loss goal, individual or group sessions about diet and exercise, meetings with a trained diet or exercise counselor, or individually tailored diet or exercise plans.

<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
The USPSTF found only 2 studies, both conducted in Europe,&nbsp;that directly evaluated the mortality benefit of screening in asymptomatic adults. Neither study had follow-up beyond 10 years or measured nonfatal cardiovascular events. Screening studies that follow larger numbers of participants for 20 years or longer and measure both morbidity and mortality are needed. Further, screening studies in the U.S. population (in which the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes is probably higher than that identified in European studies [3%]) are needed. More research is needed on the effects of screening among racial/ethnic minorities because they have a higher prevalence of diabetes than white persons. Clinical trials and additional modeling studies are needed to better elucidate the optimal frequency of screening and the age at which to start screening. More U.S. data are also needed on the benefits and harms of lifestyle interventions and medical treatments for screen-detected IFG, IGT, and diabetes over a longer follow-up period.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/screening-for-abnormal-blood-glucose-and-type-2-diabetes#Pod5,158,"The American Diabetes Association&nbsp;recommends screening for diabetes in adults aged 45 years or older and screening in persons with multiple risk factors regardless of age. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists,&nbsp;American Academy of Family Physicians,&nbsp;Diabetes Australia,&nbsp;Diabetes UK&nbsp;and the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care&nbsp;recommend screening for diabetes in persons with risk factors only.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/screening-for-abnormal-blood-glucose-and-type-2-diabetes#Pod6,"<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, and nearly one quarter of deaths caused by CVD are considered to be preventable. Modifiable cardiovascular risk factors include abnormal blood glucose, hypertension, hyperlipidemia or dyslipidemia, smoking, overweight and obesity, physical inactivity, and an unhealthy diet. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency, resulting in hyperglycemia. Type 2 diabetes typically develops slowly, and progression from normal blood glucose to glucose abnormalities that meet generally accepted criteria for diabetes (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/screening-for-abnormal-blood-glucose-and-type-2-diabetes#tab"">Table</a>) may take a decade or longer. Glucose abnormalities that do not meet the criteria for diabetes include impaired fasting glucose (IFG), an impaired response to oral glucose intake (impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]), or an increased average blood glucose level as evidenced by increased levels of hemoglobin A1c&nbsp;(HbA1c). Abnormal glucose metabolism is a risk factor for CVD and, in some individuals, may progress to meet the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes. <br /><br />According to national data estimates from 2012, approximately 86 million Americans aged 20 years or older have IFG or IGT.Approximately 15% to 30% of these persons will develop type 2 diabetes within 5 years if they do not implement lifestyle changes to improve their health. <br /><br />Modifiable risk factors for abnormal glucose metabolism (manifested as either diabetes or abnormal glucose levels below the threshold for diabetes) include overweight and obesity or a high percentage of abdominal fat, physical inactivity, and smoking. Abnormal glucose metabolism is also frequently associated with other cardiovascular risk factors, such as hyperlipidemia and hypertension.<br /><br />Given the increasing prevalence of abnormal glucose metabolism in the U.S. population, the USPSTF sought to examine the benefits and harms of screening for IFG, IGT, and type 2 diabetes.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence that measuring blood glucose leads to improvements in mortality or cardiovascular morbidity.<br /><br />The USPSTF previously found adequate evidence that intensive behavioral counseling interventions for persons at increased risk for CVD have moderate benefits in lowering CVD risk. Populations in which these benefits have been shown include persons who are obese or overweight and have hypertension, hyperlipidemia or dyslipidemia, and/or IFG or IGT. Benefits of behavioral interventions include reductions in blood pressure, glucose and lipid levels, and obesity and an increase in physical activity. Studies that specifically treat persons who have IFG or IGT with intensive lifestyle interventions to prevent the development of diabetes consistently show a moderate benefit in reducing progression to diabetes. Lifestyle interventions have greater effects on reducing progression to diabetes than metformin or other medications.</p>
<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found that measuring blood glucose is associated with short-term anxiety but not long-term psychological harms. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of lifestyle interventions to reduce the incidence of diabetes are small to none. The harms of drug therapy for the prevention of diabetes are small to moderate, depending on the drug and dosage used.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit to measuring blood glucose to detect IFG, IGT, or diabetes and implementing intensive lifestyle interventions for persons found to have abnormal blood glucose. </p>",Screening for Abnormal Blood Glucose and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,"Diabetes Mellitus (Type 2) and Abnormal Blood Glucose, Screening, 2015",,,,,

Ankle-brachial index is calculated as the systolic blood pressure obtained at the ankle divided by the systolic blood pressure obtained at the brachial artery while the patient is lying down. A ratio of less than 1 (typically defined as &lt;0.9) is considered abnormal and is commonly used to define PAD. Data on the accuracy of the ABI in asymptomatic populations are limited.

Treatment of PAD focuses on improving outcomes in symptomatic patients (eg, increasing walking distance and quality of life by improving symptoms of intermittent claudication and leg function, preventing or reducing limb complications, and preserving limb viability). Interventions to prevent CVD events include smoking cessation, lowering cholesterol levels, managing high blood pressure, and antiplatelet therapy. However, because the major risk factors for PAD are also used to calculate CVD risk, patients with a low ABI may already be recommended for these treatments.</p>

11,"<p>In 2004, the USPSTF recommended against routine screening for bladder cancer in adults because the USPSTF concluded that the harms outweighed the benefits of screening (D recommendation). In 2009, the USPSTF performed a targeted literature review and found insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening for bladder cancer. In 2004, the USPSTF concluded that the harms outweighed the benefits; however, this time the USPSTF reviewed mortality statistics and other epidemiologic data that suggested heretofore undemonstrated benefits of screening. As a result, the USPSTF changed its recommendation from a D to an I statement (insufficient evidence).</p>
<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults. Although adults with mild lower urinary tract symptoms (such as urinary frequency, hesitancy, urgency, dysuria, or nocturia) are not strictly asymptomatic, these symptoms are quite common and are not believed to be associated with an increased risk for bladder cancer. The USPSTF considered it reasonable to include these persons in the population under consideration for screening. Adults with gross hematuria or acute changes in lower urinary tract symptoms are not included in this population.</p>
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
<p>Primary care-feasible screening tests for bladder cancer include identifying hematuria with a urine dipstick or microscopic urinalysis, urine cytology, and tests for urine biomarkers.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Once bladder cancer has been diagnosed, several factors determine treatment, including tumor grade, cancer stage (superficial vs. invasive), whether the tumor is recurrent, the patient's age and overall health status, and patient and physician preferences. The principal treatment for superficial (Ta or T1) bladder cancer is transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, which may be combined with adjuvant radiation therapy, intravesical chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or photodynamic therapies. Radical cystectomy, often with adjuvant or neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy, is used in cases of surgically resectable invasive bladder cancer.</p>
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding I Statement</h3>
<p>In deciding whether to screen for bladder cancer, clinicians should consider the following.</p>
<h4><em>Potential Preventable Burden</em></h4>
<p>Bladder cancer is similar to many other types of cancer in that it is a heterogeneous condition. Approximately 70% of all cases of newly diagnosed transitional cell carcinomas present as superficial tumors (including in situ); some of these tumors may never progress to advanced disease. However, some cases of bladder cancer invade the muscle tissue, progress, and metastasize; treatment has limited efficacy in these cases. Early detection of tumors with malignant potential may have an important effect on the mortality rate of bladder cancer. One challenge of screening for bladder cancer is accurately identifying cases of early-stage cancer (subepithelial and in situ) with a high risk for progression. Another area of uncertainty is determining whether providing earlier, less toxic treatment (such as immunotherapy) with the intention of preventing symptomatic progression results in fewer overall harms to the patient than providing more toxic treatment (such as radical cystectomy) only to those patients who develop symptomatic or advanced tumors. Persons at increased risk for bladder cancer include those who work in the rubber, chemical, or leather industries, as well as those who smoke, are male, are older, or have a family or personal history of bladder cancer.</p>
<h4><em>Potential Harms</em></h4>
<p>False-positive test results may result in anxiety and unneeded evaluations, diagnostic-related harms from cystoscopy and biopsy, harms from labeling or unnecessary treatments (such as transurethral resection of a bladder tumor, intravesical chemotherapy, or biologic therapies), and overdiagnosis.</p>
<h4><em>Current Practice</em></h4>
<p>Screening tests feasible for use in primary care include urine dipstick or microscopic urinalysis for hematuria, urine cytology, and tests for urine biomarkers. Tests for urine biomarkers are not commonly used in primary care in part because of their cost, although this varies substantially. Patients with positive screening results are typically referred to a urologist for further evaluation, which may include cystoscopy (and biopsy if a tumor is found), imaging, and other studies.</p>
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
<p>Several gaps in the evidence led the USPSTF to issue an I statement. Addressing these research needs could potentially provide sufficient evidence for the USPSTF to issue future screening recommendations. Cohort studies are needed to evaluate the natural history of early-stage, untreated bladder cancer (particularly that detected by screening) to allow a greater understanding of the potential overdiagnosis and overtreatment associated with screen-detected bladder cancer. Studies that compare the diagnostic accuracy of urine screening tests in representative populations are needed, as well as studies that assess the effect of screening on the incidence of bladder cancer, tumor characteristics, and subsequent treatments. Randomized, controlled trials or well-designed case-control studies that evaluate clinical outcomes in screened versus unscreened populations, which would provide direct evidence on benefits and harms of screening, have highest priority. Targeting populations at increased risk for bladder cancer because of patient characteristics or occupational exposure may be preferred to enhance feasibility and maximize clinical relevance. A better understanding of the harms related to screening and treatment are required. Methods for evaluating these harms could include conducting observational studies based on patient registries or large pharmacoepidemiologic databases. As noted, prospective cohort studies are needed to more accurately identify cases of early-stage cancer (subepithelial and in situ) with a high risk for progression. Future research should also clarify the trade-offs of using less-toxic treatments earlier and more frequently, to prevent symptomatic progression, versus using treatments with greater toxicity, which are typically reserved for those patients who develop symptomatic or advanced tumors.</p>",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf11/bladdercancer/bladcanrs.htm#clinical,112,"No major organization recommends screening for bladder cancer in asymptomatic adults. In 2011, the American Academy of Family Physicians endorsed the USPSTF recommendation. The European Association of Urology states that the best approach to primary prevention of muscle-invasive bladder cancer is to eliminate active and passive smoking. The American Cancer Society states that prompt attention to bladder symptoms is the best approach for finding bladder cancer in its earliest, most treatable stages in persons with no known risk factors.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf11/bladdercancer/bladcanrs.htm#recommendations,,Bladder Cancer ,"Bladder Cancer in Adults, Screening, 2011 ",,,,,

<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic persons without a history of skin cancer. Because most trials of skin cancer counseling predominantly include persons with fair skin types, the USPSTF limited its recommendation to this population.</p>
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
<p>Persons with fair skin types (ivory or pale skin, light eye color, red or blond hair, freckles, those who sunburn easily) are at increased risk of skin cancer and should be counseled. Other factors that further increase risk include a history of sunburns, previous use of indoor tanning beds, and a family or personal history of skin cancer. Persons with an increased number of nevi and atypical nevi are at increased risk of melanoma. Persons with a compromised immune system (eg, persons living with HIV, persons who have received an organ transplant) are at increased risk of skin cancer.</p>
<h3>Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>
<p>All studies conducted in children and adolescents focused on sun protection behaviors; most were directed at parents, and some provided child-specific materials or messages. Half of the interventions included face-to-face counseling, and all included print materials. Three studies provided the intervention in conjunction with well-child visits. The majority of studies conducted in young adults and adults focused on improving sun protection behaviors, and 2 studies used &ldquo;appearance-focused&rdquo; messages. The mode of delivery varied and included mail-based, face-to-face or telephone counseling, and technology-based (text messages, online programs and modules, personal UV facial photographs) interventions.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation2""><span style=""font-size: small;"">2</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
<p>Counseling adults about performing skin self-examination appears to result in an increase of such examinations. The potential benefit of behavioral counseling about skin self-examination is uncertain because of the lack of evidence on the link between behavior change and skin cancer or other health outcomes. In addition, there is no evidence about the incremental benefit that might occur with skin self-examination above the benefit from counseling for skin protective behaviors and from current levels of skin examinations being performed by clinicians.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
<p>Skin self-examination is performed by the patient and is noninvasive. Psychosocial harms, such as anxiety or cancer worry, are possible. If skin self-examination leads to biopsy, procedural harms such as pain, bleeding, scarring, or infection could occur.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation7""><span style=""font-size: small;"">7</span></a></sup></p>
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
<p>The frequency of behavioral counseling for skin self-examination in the asymptomatic population is not well known.</p>
<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>
<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends child care center&ndash;based, primary and middle school&ndash;based, and multicomponent community-wide interventions for the prevention of skin cancer.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation8""><span style=""font-size: small;"">8</span></a></sup> These interventions combine school- and community-based communications and policy to increase preventive behaviors (eg, covering up, using shade, or avoiding the sun during peak UV hours) among certain populations in specific settings.</p>
<p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provides information to help guide patients and clinicians regarding sun protection and the use and effectiveness of broad-spectrum sunscreen.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation9""><span style=""font-size: small;"">9</span></a></sup> The FDA has determined that broad-spectrum sunscreens with a sun-protection factor of 15 or greater, reapplied at least every 2 hours, protect against both UVA and UVB radiation and reduce the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging. The FDA also provides consumer education materials on the dangers of indoor tanning.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation10""><span style=""font-size: small;"">10</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency provides a variety of educational tools regarding sun safety, including state-specific information, and interactive widgets and smartphone applications that forecast UV exposure by zip code or city. It also provides sun safety fact sheets and handouts, including age-appropriate materials.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation11""><span style=""font-size: small;"">11</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
<p>The USPSTF has issued a recommendation on screening for skin cancer in adults.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation12""><span style=""font-size: small;"">12</span></a></sup></p>",,190,"<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Interventions included tailored mailings, print materials, and in-person counseling by health professionals. Interventions for children were directed mostly toward parents; some materials were child-specific. Counseling interventions for children, their parents, or both provided messages focused on increasing sun protection behaviors (eg, using sunscreen, avoiding midday sun, wearing sun-protective clothing). Some print-based interventions included materials tailored to the child&rsquo;s risk level, barriers to change, self-efficacy, or other factors. Health professionals providing in-person counseling included primary care clinicians and health educators.</p>
<p>One trial of an intervention involving children 3 years and younger used clinician counseling and print materials for parents promoting child sun protection with sun protection aids (sunscreen samples and hat).<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation13""><span style=""font-size: small;"">13</span></a></sup> Several trials in children aged 3 to 10 years used standard or tailored mailings over 1 to 36 months.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation14""><span style=""font-size: small;"">14-17</span></a></sup> One study also included a DVD in addition to a standard mailing promoting sun protection. One trial used a 1-day, in-person parent education session with a children's video, print materials, and sun protection aids (shirt, hat, and sunscreen). For the single study in adolescents, clinicians directly counseled participants, with 4 follow-up telephone counseling sessions by a health educator over 18 months; mailed materials and sunscreen samples were also used.</p>
<p>In the 16 trials among adults, interventions included a variety of messages and components, conducted in a range of settings.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation2""><span style=""font-size: small;"">2</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation4"">4</a></sup></span> Technology-based interventions included an interactive web program and tailored text messages on sun protection, as well as appearance-focused print materials. The web program study reported reduced sunburns after the intervention, which provided information on topics such as indoor tanning, UV radiation exposure and health, skin cancer, sunscreen, and skin examination. Each module took about 10 minutes to complete and included a goal-setting section. Other interventions that increased sun protection behaviors in adults included mailed print materials containing personalized risk feedback and recommendations, self-monitoring aids for UV exposure, and skin cancer prevention and detection information; individualized computer reports; and an interactive educational computer program on skin cancer prevention that provided individual feedback on personal risk of skin cancer.</p>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
<p>A better understanding of the effectiveness of counseling on the use of sun protection behaviors in adults 25 years and older is needed to address the key evidence gap on counseling for this age group. Research that evaluates the association between UV exposure during adulthood and skin cancer risk would also be valuable.</p>
<p>In addition, studies regarding the effectiveness of counseling persons without a fair skin type are lacking. Ideally, research studies would provide measurements of sun exposure, sunburn, precursor skin lesions, and cancer among large trial populations, with an emphasis on behaviors and health outcomes among persons who receive an intervention focused on sun protection behaviors. Such studies would also assess whether these behaviors continue after trial completion. These cohorts should include populations with diverse skin colors and should include adolescents, young adults, and preschool-aged children and their parents. These studies may be used to further develop technologies and vehicles for administering relevant interventions for behavior change in the primary care setting, especially among nonwhite persons, young adults, and persons who practice indoor or outdoor tanning. Further evidence is needed to assess the balance of benefits and harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cancer and premature death.</p>

<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends education and policy approaches to encourage sun protection behaviors in child care centers, schools, recreational sites, and occupational settings. In addition, it recommends community-wide interventions that may or may not involve health care settings to increase protection behavior from UV radiation. Interventions include mass media campaigns and environmental and policy changes across multiple settings within a defined geographic area or an entire community.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation8""><span style=""font-size: small;"">8</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The American Academy of Dermatology encourages everyone to perform skin self-examination to check for signs of skin cancer.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation46""><span style=""font-size: small;"">46</span></a></sup> The American Cancer Society<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation47""><span style=""font-size: small;"">47</span></a></sup> and the Skin Cancer Foundation<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation48""><span style=""font-size: small;"">48</span></a></sup> recommend monthly skin self-examination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This recommendation replaces the 2012 USPSTF recommendation on counseling about skin cancer prevention<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation19""><span style=""font-size: small;"">19</span></a></sup> and the skin self-examination portion of the 2009 USPSTF recommendation on screening for skin cancer.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation20""><span style=""font-size: small;"">20</span></a></sup> In this updated recommendation, the USPSTF expanded the age range for behavioral counseling interventions to include persons aged 6 months to 24 years with fair skin types (the previous recommendation applied to persons aged 10 to 24 years, based on the evidence available at that time). Recent studies in children younger than 10 years resulted in the USPSTF extending the lower end of the age range to 6 months, the minimum age recommended for sunscreen use. Based on additional evidence since the prior recommendation, the USPSTF now also recommends that clinicians consider selectively offering counseling to adults older than 24 years with fair skin types. As in 2012, the evidence on persons without a fair skin type remains insufficient for this population to be included in the recommendation statement. The evidence continues to be insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cancer, as it was in 2009.</p>",https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation8,"<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the United States and is generally categorized as melanoma or nonmelanoma skin cancer. Melanoma is the fifth-leading type of incident cancer, and 2.2% of adults will be diagnosed with it in their lifetime.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup> Although invasive melanoma accounts for 2% of all skin cancer cases, it is responsible for 80% of skin cancer deaths.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup> Basal and squamous cell carcinoma, the 2 predominant types of nonmelanoma skin cancer, represent the vast majority of skin cancer cases. There were an estimated 3.3 million new cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer in 2012 and an estimated 91,270 new cases of melanoma skin cancer in 2018.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Recognition of Risk Status</h3>
<p>Exposure to UV radiation during childhood and adolescence increases the risk of skin cancer later in life, especially when more severe damage occurs, such as with severe sunburns. Persons with fair skin types (ivory or pale skin, light hair and eye color, freckles, or those who sunburn easily) are at increased risk of skin cancer. Persons who use tanning beds and those with a history of sunburns or previous skin cancer are also at substantially increased risk of skin cancer. Other factors that further increase risk include an increased number of nevi (moles) and atypical nevi, family history of skin cancer, HIV infection, and history of receiving an organ transplant. Most studies of interventions to increase sun protection behaviors have been limited to persons with fair skin types.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation2""><span style=""font-size: small;"">2-4</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Benefits of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>
<p>Behavioral counseling interventions target sun protection behaviors to reduce UV radiation exposure. UV radiation is a known carcinogen<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation5""><span style=""font-size: small;"">5</span></a></sup> that damages DNA and causes most skin cancer cases.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-counseling2#citation6""><span style=""font-size: small;"">6</span></a></sup> A substantial body of observational evidence demonstrates that the strongest connection between UV radiation exposure and skin cancer results from exposure in childhood and adolescence. Sun protection behaviors include the use of broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun-protection factor of 15 or greater; wearing hats, sunglasses, or sun-protective clothing; avoiding sun exposure; seeking shade during midday hours (10 am to 4 pm); and avoiding indoor tanning bed use.</p>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavioral counseling interventions available in or referable from a primary care setting result in a moderate increase in the use of sun protection behaviors for persons aged 6 months to 24 years with fair skin types.</p>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavioral counseling interventions available in or referable from a primary care setting result in a small increase in the use of sun protection behaviors for persons older than 24 years with fair skin types.</p>
<p>The USPSTF found insufficient evidence regarding the benefits of counseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cancer.</p>
<h3>Harms of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms related to behavioral counseling interventions and sun protection behaviors in young persons or adults are small. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence regarding the harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>

14,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
<p>This recommendation applies to adult men in the general US population without symptoms or a previous diagnosis of prostate cancer. It also applies to men at increased risk of death from prostate cancer because of race/ethnicity or family history of prostate cancer. The sections below provide more information on how this recommendation applies to African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer.</p>
<h3>Risk Assessment</h3>
<p>Older age, African American race, and family history of prostate cancer are the most important risk factors for the development of prostate cancer. Other factors with weaker associations and less evidence include diets high in fat and low in vegetable consumption. Cigarette smoking is associated with higher risk of prostate cancer mortality.</p>
<h3>Screening</h3>
<p>PSA-based screening is the usual method of screening and has been studied in several large trials. Although new screening methods are being developed (such as single- and adjusted-threshold testing and PSA velocity and doubling time), evidence is insufficient to support one method of PSA-based screening over another. Evidence is also insufficient that using a prebiopsy risk calculator, with or without measurement of free PSA levels, or using genetic or adjunctive imaging tests meaningfully changes the potential benefits and harms of screening. This is an important area of current research that has the potential to decrease the harms of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer. The use of digital rectal examination as a screening modality is not recommended because there is a lack of evidence on the benefits; digital rectal examination was either eliminated from or not included in the major screening trials.</p>
<p>PSA-based screening for prostate cancer has been studied in 3 very large RCTs, each with at least a decade of median follow-up: the US-based Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC), and the Cluster Randomized Trial of PSA Testing for Prostate Cancer (CAP). These trials used varying screening intervals (from 1-time screening to every 1 to 4 years) and PSA thresholds (2.5 to 10.0 ng/mL) for diagnostic biopsy.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation3""><span style=""font-size: small;"">3</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The PLCO trial may be viewed as a trial of organized vs opportunistic screening for prostate cancer because of the substantial screening rate in the control group and the high screening rate among men in both the control and intervention groups prior to study enrollment.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation6""><span style=""font-size: small;"">6</span></a></sup> Men in the intervention group were screened more often than men in the control group, and more men in the intervention group were diagnosed with prostate cancer than in the control group. The trial found no difference between groups in death from prostate cancer after almost 15 years of follow-up (absolute risk, 4.8 per 1000 person-years in the intervention group vs 4.6 per 1000 person-years in the control group; relative risk [RR], 1.04 [95% CI, 0.87-1.24]).<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation7""><span style=""font-size: small;"">7</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In the ERSPC trial, the results suggest that, overall, the number needed to screen is 781 men aged 55 to 69 years at enrollment (95% CI, 490-1929) to prevent 1 man from dying of prostate cancer after 13 years. The results varied across the individual ERSPC sites, and prostate cancer mortality was significantly reduced only at the sites in the Netherlands and Sweden. However, point estimates were in favor of screening at all sites except Switzerland. At the largest site (Finland), there was no significant benefit observed for prostate cancer mortality (rate ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.75-1.10]), and in Sweden there was an absolute risk reduction of 0.72% (95% CI, 0.50%-0.94%), a 42% relative reduction.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation8""><span style=""font-size: small;"">8-10</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Four ERSPC trial sites reported data on the effect of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer on the development of metastatic cancer after 12 years of follow-up. The risk of developing metastatic prostate cancer was 30% lower among men randomized to screening than among men in the control group (absolute risk, 7.05 per 1000 men in the screening group vs 10.14 per 1000 men in the control group [calculated from numbers in the study]). This translates to an absolute reduction in the long-term risk of metastatic prostate cancer of 3.1 cases per 1000 men screened.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation11""><span style=""font-size: small;"">11</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The CAP trial was a cluster-randomized trial of a single invitation to PSA-based screening in the United Kingdom among 415,357 men. Overall, 34% of invited men received a valid PSA screening test. After a median follow-up of 10 years, there was no significant difference in prostate cancer mortality between the invited group and the control group (absolute risk, 0.30 per 1000 person-years vs 0.31 per 1000 person-years, respectively).<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation12""><span style=""font-size: small;"">12</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Based on clinical stage, tumor grade, and PSA level, prostate cancer is classified as low, medium, or high risk for clinical progression and prostate cancer death. Although treatment is thought to be most immediately beneficial for men with high- and medium-risk prostate cancer, the vast majority of cases of screen-detected cancer are low risk.</p>
<p>As with all screening tests, some men without prostate cancer will receive positive PSA test results (ie, &ldquo;false-positive&rdquo; results). The false-positive rate for the PSA test depends on the PSA threshold used. Among 5 ERSPC sites that reported the false-positive rate, approximately 1 in 6 men screened at least once had 1 or more false-positive results, and of the positive results in the first round of screening, two-thirds were false positives. In Sweden, where a low PSA threshold (3.0 ng/mL) was used to determine a positive test result and men were screened every 2 years, more than 45% of men who participated in all screening rounds had a false-positive result over 10 years of screening.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation5""><span style=""font-size: small;"">5</span></a></sup> In the PLCO trial, more than two-thirds of men who underwent a prostate biopsy because of a positive PSA test result were found not to have prostate cancer.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation13""><span style=""font-size: small;"">13</span></a></sup> In addition to false-positive results, there are other harms associated with screening and subsequent diagnostic evaluation; biopsies may result in pain, fever, hematospermia, and hospitalization.</p>
<p>The 3 large RCTs on screening predominantly included men aged 55 to 69 years. There is inadequate evidence on starting screening at a younger age in the average-risk population or to obtain a baseline PSA level. Evidence in men 70 years and older does not support routine screening because of the lack of trial evidence of benefit, the low likelihood of benefit given the time to realize benefit, and the increased risk of harms from false-positive results, biopsies, overdiagnosis, and treatment. Although the evidence does not support routine screening in all men older than 70 years, the USPSTF recognizes the common use of PSA-based screening in practice today and understands that some older men will continue to request screening and some clinicians will continue to offer it. Men older than 70 years who request screening should be aware of the reduced likelihood of benefit from screening and the increased risk of false-positive test results and complications of diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>The USPSTF considered whether there are screening and follow-up approaches that increase the potential for benefit while reducing the potential for harms. Variation across sites in randomized trials of screening suggests there may be greater mortality benefit from screening every other year compared with longer intervals and from using lower PSA thresholds for diagnostic biopsy. Although these approaches may have increased the potential benefit reported in studies, they also resulted in substantially more harms&mdash;more false-positive results, more prostate biopsies, and more cases of overdiagnosis. This trade-off was also observed in a review of decision analysis models; screening protocols using lower PSA thresholds (<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation14""><span style=""font-size: small;"">14</span></a> The frequency of screening in the ERSCP sites ranged from every 2 to 7 years. No ERSPC trial site offered screening more often than every 2 years, and many sites screened every 4 years. The PSA threshold for biopsy in the ERSCP sites ranged from 2.5 to 4 ng/mL (except for 10 ng/mL in the earlier years at the Belgium site). In the G&ouml;teborg, Sweden, site, which reported the largest benefit, the frequency of screening was every 2 years, and the threshold for biopsy was 2.5 ng/mL (3.0 ng/mL in the first few years of the study).</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>The potential benefit of screening for prostate cancer is because of treatment. Thus, it is important for men to consider both the potential benefits and harms of treatment (including active surveillance) as they consider whether to be screened. Men not able or willing to tolerate treatment should not be screened for prostate cancer. Because most cases of prostate cancer advance very slowly, if at all, the 10-year survival rate for screen-detected, localized prostate cancer is very high. In a recent major trial that enrolled more than 1500 men randomized to receive either active treatment or active surveillance, the 10-year survival rate in all groups was 99%.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation15""><span style=""font-size: small;"">15</span></a></sup> The good prognosis for early-stage prostate cancer makes it difficult to study the effectiveness of treatment.</p>
<p>Multiple treatment options exist for prostate cancer, and new ones are being developed. In current practice, the 3 most common treatment options for men with screen-detected, localized prostate cancer are surgical removal of the prostate gland (radical prostatectomy), radiation therapy (external-beam radiation therapy, proton beam therapy, or brachytherapy), and active surveillance. The USPSTF considered available evidence on treatment when evaluating the effectiveness of screening and found that current evidence suggests that treatment of early-stage, screen-detected prostate cancer with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy likely reduces risk of clinical progression and metastatic disease and may reduce prostate cancer mortality. More details about the effectiveness and adverse effects of active treatment are provided in the Discussion section.</p>
<p>Active surveillance is a treatment approach that seeks to limit the harms of treatment by allowing men with apparent low-risk prostate cancer to forego surgery or radiation in favor of ongoing monitoring of their cancer. Although protocols vary, active surveillance usually includes regular, repeated PSA testing and often repeated digital rectal examination and prostate biopsy, with potential for exposure to repeated harms from biopsies. Men whose cancer is found to be changing are offered definitive treatment with surgery or radiation therapy. Other treatment monitoring strategies for men with low-risk cancer exist (for example, watchful waiting) and also vary in protocol. Active surveillance has become a more common treatment choice in the United States over the past several years. In a study assessing community-based urology practice in the United States between 2010 and 2013, about half of men with low-risk prostate cancer were treated with radical prostatectomy. The active surveillance rate, however, increased from about 10% in 2005-2009 to 40.4% in 2010-2013 among men with low-risk prostate cancer.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation16""><span style=""font-size: small;"">16</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Active treatment of prostate cancer can result in major adverse effects. About 3 in 1000 men die during or soon after radical prostatectomy, and about 50 in 1000 men have serious surgical complications requiring intervention. About 1 in 5 men who undergo radical prostatectomy develop long-term urinary incontinence requiring regular use of pads, and about 2 in 3 men experience long-term erectile dysfunction. More than half of men who receive radiation therapy experience long-term erectile dysfunction, and up to 1 in 6 men experience long-term bothersome bowel symptoms, including bowel urgency and fecal incontinence.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation3""><span style=""font-size: small;"">3</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Screening for Prostate Cancer in African American Men</h3>
<h4>Burden</h4>
<p>In the United States, African American men are more likely to develop prostate cancer than white men (203.5 vs 121.9 cases per 100,000 men). African American men are also more than twice as likely as white men to die of prostate cancer (44.1 vs 19.1 deaths per 100,000 men).<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup> The higher death rate is attributable in part to an earlier age at cancer onset, more advanced cancer stage at diagnosis, and higher rates of more aggressive cancer (ie, higher tumor grade). These differences in death from prostate cancer may also reflect that African American men have lower rates of receiving high-quality care.</p>
<h4>Available Evidence</h4>
<p>The USPSTF searched for evidence about the potential benefits and harms of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in African American men.</p>

<p>The PLCO trial enrolled 4% African American men, which is not enough to determine whether the overall trial results differed for African American men.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation17""><span style=""font-size: small;"">17</span></a></sup> The ERSPC trial did not record or report any race-specific subgroup information. The low proportion of persons of African descent in European countries during the study period makes it likely that these groups were not well represented.</p>
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
<p>An analysis from the PLCO trial found that African American men were significantly more likely to have major infections after prostate biopsy than white men (odds ratio [OR], 7.1 [95% CI, 2.7-18.0]).<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation13""><span style=""font-size: small;"">13</span></a></sup> Evidence is insufficient to compare the risk of false-positive results, potential for overdiagnosis, and magnitude of harms from prostate cancer treatment in African American vs other men.</p>
<h4>Advising African American Men</h4>
<p>Based on the available evidence, the USPSTF is not able to make a separate, specific recommendation on PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in African American men. Although it is possible that screening may offer greater benefits for African American men compared with the general population, currently no direct evidence demonstrates whether this is true. Screening, and subsequent diagnosis and treatment, has the potential to increase exposure to potential harms. Decision analysis models suggest that given the higher rates of aggressive prostate cancer in African American men, PSA-based screening may provide greater benefit to African American men than the general population. These models also suggest a potential mortality benefit for African American men when beginning screening before age 55 years. The USPSTF believes that a reasonable approach for clinicians is to inform African American men about their increased risk of developing and dying of prostate cancer as well as the potential benefits and harms of screening so they can make an informed, personal decision about whether to be screened. Although the USPSTF found inadequate evidence about how benefits may differ for African American men, it recognizes the epidemiologic data showing that African American men may develop prostate cancer at younger ages than average-risk men and understands that some African American men and their clinicians will continue to screen at younger ages. The USPSTF does not recommend screening for prostate cancer in men, including African American men, older than 70 years.</p>
<p>The USPSTF strongly encourages research on screening for and treatment of prostate cancer in African American men. It is important to consider both the potential additional benefits and harms to fully understand the value of screening. Studies are needed to confirm that African American men who undergo screening receive similar or greater reductions in prostate cancer mortality compared with men in the general population, as well as to explore the optimal screening frequency and whether beginning screening before age 55 years provides additional benefits in African American men. Studies are also needed to better understand strategies to mitigate harms and maximize benefits of screening, diagnostic follow-up, and treatment (including active surveillance) in African American men. It is also important that research and quality improvement activities continue to work to eliminate disparities in access to high-quality care for men with prostate cancer.</p>
<h3>Screening for Prostate Cancer in Men With a Family History</h3>
<h4>Burden</h4>
<p>The introduction of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer has substantially altered the epidemiologic data for prostate cancer, greatly increasing the number of men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer and thus also the number of men with a father, brother, or son with a history of prostate cancer.</p>
<h4>Available Evidence</h4>
<p>It is generally accepted that men with a family history of prostate cancer are more likely to develop prostate cancer. A study of twins in Scandinavia estimated that genetic factors may account for up to 42% of prostate cancer risk.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation18""><span style=""font-size: small;"">18</span></a></sup> An analysis from the Finnish site of the ERSPC trial concluded that men with at least 1 first-degree relative with prostate cancer were 30% more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer than men without a family history.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation19""><span style=""font-size: small;"">19</span></a></sup> Men with 3 first-degree relatives with prostate cancer or 2 close relatives on the same side of the family with prostate cancer diagnosed before age 55 years may have an inheritable form of prostate cancer associated with genetic changes passed down from one generation to the next. This type of prostate cancer is thought to account for less than 10% of all prostate cancer cases.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation20""><span style=""font-size: small;"">20</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The USPSTF searched for evidence about the potential benefits and harms of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men with a family history of prostate cancer.</p>
<h4>Potential Benefits</h4>
<p>Of the 7% of men in the PLCO trial who reported a family history of prostate cancer on a baseline questionnaire, prostate cancer mortality was lower among white men in the intervention group than in the control group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.49 [95% CI, 0.22-1.10]; <em>P</em> = 0.08),<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation21""><span style=""font-size: small;"">21</span></a></sup> but the difference was not significant and the confidence interval was wide.</p>
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
<p>No studies have assessed the risk of harms related to screening for, diagnosis of, or treatment of prostate cancer based on family history of prostate cancer.</p>
<h4>Advising Men With a Family History of Prostate Cancer</h4>
<p>Based on the available evidence, the USPSTF is not able to make a separate, specific recommendation on PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men with a family history of prostate cancer. Although it is possible that screening may offer additional potential benefits for these men compared with the general population, screening also has the potential to increase exposure to potential harms, especially among men with relatives whose cancer was overdiagnosed. Men who have a first-degree relative who had advanced prostate cancer at diagnosis, developed metastatic prostate cancer, or died of prostate cancer are probably the most likely to benefit from screening. The USPSTF believes that a reasonable approach for clinicians is to inform men with a family history of prostate cancer, particularly those with multiple first-degree relatives with prostate cancer, about their increased risk of developing cancer as well as the potential earlier age at disease onset. This discussion should include the potential benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer so these men have the opportunity to make an informed, personal decision about whether to be screened. Although the USPSTF found inadequate evidence about how benefits may differ for men with a family history of prostate cancer, it recognizes the epidemiologic data showing that these men are at a greater than average risk and understands that some men and their clinicians will continue to screen at younger ages in men with a family history. The USPSTF does not recommend screening for prostate cancer in men, including men with a family history of prostate cancer, older than 70 years.</p>
<p>Epidemiologic studies examining outcomes in men with relatives who died of prostate cancer vs men with relatives diagnosed with prostate cancer who died of other causes may help provide better guidance. Studies are needed that explore the optimal screening frequency and whether beginning screening before age 55 years provides additional benefits for men with a family history of prostate cancer. Additional research is also needed to help identify men with an inheritable form of prostate cancer and to understand how the potential benefits and harms of screening, including screening intervals and starting ages, may differ in these men compared with the general population.</p>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>

<li>Comparing different screening strategies, including different screening intervals, to fully understand the effects on benefits and harms</li>
<li>Developing, validating, and providing longer-term follow-up of screening and diagnostic techniques, including risk stratification tools, use of baseline PSA level as a risk factor, and use of non&ndash;PSA-based adjunctive tests that can distinguish nonprogressive and slowly progressive cancer from cancer that is likely to become symptomatic and affect quality or length of life, to reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment</li>
<li>Screening for and treatment of prostate cancer in African American men, including understanding the potential benefits and harms of different starting ages and screening intervals and the use of active surveillance; given the large disparities in prostate cancer mortality in African American men, this should be a national priority</li>

The American Urological Association<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation42""><span style=""font-size: small;"">42</span></a></sup> recommends that men aged 55 to 69 years with a life expectancy of more than 10 to 15 years be informed of the benefits and harms of screening and engage in shared decision making with their clinicians, taking into account each man&rsquo;s values and preferences. It notes that to reduce the harms of screening, the screening interval should be 2 or more years. The American Urological Association also notes that decisions about screening, including potentially starting screening before age 55 years, should be individual ones for African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer. The American Cancer Society<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation43""><span style=""font-size: small;"">43</span></a></sup> adopted detailed screening recommendations in 2016 that highlight the importance of shared decision making and the need for informed discussion of the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits of screening. It recommends conversations about screening beginning at age 50 years and earlier for African American men and men with a father or brother with a history of prostate cancer before age 65 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation replaces the 2012 USPSTF recommendation<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation38""><span style=""font-size: small;"">38</span></a></sup> on PSA-based screening for prostate cancer. In 2012, the USPSTF concluded that, although there are potential benefits of screening for prostate cancer, these benefits do not outweigh the expected harms enough to recommend routine screening (D recommendation). The change in recommendation grade is based in part on additional evidence that increased the USPSTF&rsquo;s certainty about the reductions in risk of dying of prostate cancer and risk of metastatic disease. Longer-term follow-up of the ERSPC trial and from some ERSPC trial sites found that PSA-based screening for prostate cancer prevents 1.28 men from dying of prostate cancer for every 1000 men screened. In addition, a subset of ERSPC trial sites have since reported that screening 1000 men aged 55 to 69 years may prevent approximately 3 men from developing metastatic prostate cancer. Longer-term, 12.7-year results of the PIVOT trial became available since the posting of the draft recommendation statement and are similar to the 10-year results. Studies continue to demonstrate the harms of PSA-based screening, including false-positive results, complications from transrectal prostate biopsies, overdiagnosis (which may occur in 20%-50% of cases of screen-detected cancer, based on estimates from trial data), psychological harms, and harms of treatment, including urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. The change in recommendation grade further reflects new evidence about and increased use of active surveillance of low-risk prostate cancer, which may reduce the risk of subsequent harms from screening. This recommendation also clearly identifies African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer as having higher risk for prostate cancer and provides additional information to help support these men in making informed decisions about screening. For the C recommendation for men aged 55 to 69 years, the USPSTF&rsquo;s intention is to convey that each man&rsquo;s values may shift the balance to a net benefit of screening and to promote the importance of informed decision making prior to screening. The USPSTF continues to find that the benefits of screening do not outweigh the harms in men 70 years and older and recommends against screening in these men.</p>",https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation39,"<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer that affects men. In the United States, the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer is approximately 13%, and the lifetime risk of dying of prostate cancer is 2.5%.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup> Many men with prostate cancer never experience symptoms and, without screening, would never know they have the disease. In autopsy studies of men who died of other causes, more than 20% of men aged 50 to 59 years and more than 33% of men aged 70 to 79 years were found to have prostate cancer.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation2""><span style=""font-size: small;"">2</span></a></sup> In some men, the cancer is more aggressive and leads to death. The median age of death from prostate cancer is 80 years, and more than two-thirds of all men who die of prostate cancer are older than 75 years.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup> African American men have an increased lifetime risk of prostate cancer death compared with those of other races/ethnicities (4.2% for African American men, 2.9% for Hispanic men, 2.3% for white men, and 2.1% for Asian and Pacific Islander men).<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>Screening for prostate cancer begins with a test that measures the amount of PSA protein in the blood. An elevated PSA level may be caused by prostate cancer but can also be caused by other conditions, including an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia) and inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis). Some men without prostate cancer may therefore have positive screening results (ie, &ldquo;false-positive&rdquo; results). Men with a positive PSA test result may undergo a transrectal ultrasound-guided core-needle biopsy of the prostate to diagnose prostate cancer.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>
<p>The goal of screening for prostate cancer is to identify high-risk, localized prostate cancer that can be successfully treated, thereby preventing the morbidity and mortality associated with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Adequate evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) shows that PSA-based screening programs in men aged 55 to 69 years may prevent approximately 1.3 deaths from prostate cancer over approximately 13 years per 1000 men screened.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation3""><span style=""font-size: small;"">3</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation4"">4</a></sup></span> Screening programs may also prevent approximately 3 cases of metastatic prostate cancer per 1000 men screened.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation3""><span style=""font-size: small;"">3</span></a></sup> Current results from screening trials show no reductions in all-cause mortality from screening. There is inadequate evidence to assess whether the benefits for African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer aged 55 to 69 years are different than the benefits for the average-risk population. There is also inadequate evidence to assess whether there are benefits to starting screening in these high-risk groups before age 55 years.</p>
<p>Adequate evidence from RCTs is consistent with no benefit of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer on prostate cancer mortality in men 70 years and older.</p>
<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>
<p>The harms of screening for prostate cancer include harms from the PSA screening test and subsequent harms from diagnosis and treatment. Potential harms of screening include frequent false-positive results and psychological harms. One major trial in men screened every 2 to 4 years concluded that, over 10 years, more than 15% of men experienced at least 1 false-positive test result.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation5""><span style=""font-size: small;"">5</span></a></sup> Harms of diagnostic procedures include complications of prostate biopsy, such as pain, hematospermia (blood in semen or ejaculate), and infection. Approximately 1% of prostate biopsies result in complications requiring hospitalization. The false-positive and complication rates from biopsy are higher in older men.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation3""><span style=""font-size: small;"">3</span></a></sup> Adequate evidence suggests that the harms of screening and diagnostic procedures are at least small.</p>
<p>PSA-based screening for prostate cancer leads to the diagnosis of prostate cancer in some men whose cancer would never have become symptomatic during their lifetime. Treatment of these men results in harms and provides them with no benefit. This is known as overdiagnosis, and follow-up of large randomized trials suggests that 20% to 50% of men diagnosed with prostate cancer through screening may be overdiagnosed.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation3""><span style=""font-size: small;"">3</span></a></sup> Overdiagnosis rates would be expected to increase with age and to be highest in men 70 years and older because older men have high risk of death from competing causes.</p>
<p>Harms of prostate cancer treatment include erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and bothersome bowel symptoms. About 1 in 5 men who undergo radical prostatectomy develop long-term urinary incontinence requiring use of pads, and 2 in 3 men will experience long-term erectile dysfunction. More than half of men who receive radiation therapy experience long-term sexual erectile dysfunction and up to 1 in 6 men experience long-term bothersome bowel symptoms, including bowel urgency and fecal incontinence.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/prostate-cancer-screening1#citation3""><span style=""font-size: small;"">3</span></a></sup> Adequate evidence suggests that the harms of overdiagnosis and treatment are at least moderate.</p>
<p>Adequate evidence shows that the harms of screening in men older than 70 years are at least moderate and greater than in younger men because of increased risk of false-positive results, harms from diagnostic biopsy, and harms from treatment.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>PSA-based screening for prostate cancer has both potential benefits and harms. The USPSTF does not recommend screening for prostate cancer unless men express a preference for screening after being informed of and understanding the benefits and risks. The decision about whether to be screened for prostate cancer requires that each man incorporate his own values about the potential benefits and harms. The potential harms of screening, diagnostic procedures, and treatment occur soon after screening takes place. Although the potential benefits may occur any time after screening, they generally occur years after treatment, because progression from asymptomatic, screen-detected cancer to symptomatic, metastasized cancer or death (if it occurs at all) may take years or decades to occur.</p>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men aged 55 to 69 years is small for some men. How each man weighs specific benefits and harms will determine whether the overall net benefit is small.</p>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the potential benefits of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men 70 years and older do not outweigh the expected harms.</p>",Screening for Prostate Cancer,"Prostate Cancer, Screening, 2018",,,,,

<h4>Current Practice</h4>
<p>Vitamin D and calcium supplementation are often recommended for women, especially postmenopausal women, to prevent fractures, although actual use is uncertain. Based on 2011&ndash;2012 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, an estimated 27% of men and 35% of women older than 20 years take a vitamin D supplement, and 26% of men and 33% of women take a calcium supplement.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vitamin-d-calcium-or-combined-supplementation-for-the-primary-prevention-of-fractures-in-adults-preventive-medication#citation20""><span style=""font-size: small;"">20</span></a></sup> The exact dosage of supplementation is not known.</p>
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
<p>The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis in women 65 years or older and in younger women at increased risk.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vitamin-d-calcium-or-combined-supplementation-for-the-primary-prevention-of-fractures-in-adults-preventive-medication#citation21""><span style=""font-size: small;"">21</span></a></sup> The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vitamin-d-calcium-or-combined-supplementation-for-the-primary-prevention-of-fractures-in-adults-preventive-medication#citation22""><span style=""font-size: small;"">22</span></a></sup></p>

<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
<p>Research is needed to determine whether daily supplementation with doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D and greater than 1000 mg of calcium reduces fracture incidence in postmenopausal women and in older men. Prospective studies should assess the potential benefits of vitamin D and calcium supplementation in premenopausal women on fracture incidence later in life. Studies need to be adequately powered and should evaluate consistent fracture outcomes. Studies are also needed to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on diverse populations. Because white women have the highest risk for osteoporotic fractures, most fracture prevention studies have been conducted in this population, and it is difficult to extrapolate results to nonwhite populations. In addition, more studies evaluating the potential harms of supplementation are needed, particularly studies on calcium and potential adverse cardiovascular outcomes.</p>

Neither organization has recommendations specific to fracture prevention. The Institute of Medicine notes the challenge of determining dietary reference intakes given the complex interrelationship between calcium and vitamin D, the inconsistency of studies examining bone health outcomes, and the need to limit sun exposure to minimize skin cancer risk. The National Osteoporosis Foundation supports the Institute of Medicine&rsquo;s recommendations regarding calcium consumption and recommends that adults 50 years or older consume 800 to 1000 IU of vitamin D daily.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vitamin-d-calcium-or-combined-supplementation-for-the-primary-prevention-of-fractures-in-adults-preventive-medication#citation39""><span style=""font-size: small;"">39</span></a></sup> The Endocrine Society recommends that adults 65 years or older consume 800 IU of vitamin D daily for the prevention of falls and fractures.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vitamin-d-calcium-or-combined-supplementation-for-the-primary-prevention-of-fractures-in-adults-preventive-medication#citation40""><span style=""font-size: small;"">40</span></a></sup> The American Geriatric Society recommends that adults 65 years or older take daily vitamin D supplementation of at least 1000 IU as well as calcium to reduce the risk for fractures and falls.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vitamin-d-calcium-or-combined-supplementation-for-the-primary-prevention-of-fractures-in-adults-preventive-medication#citation41""><span style=""font-size: small;"">41</span></a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE OF PREVIOUS USPSTF RECOMMENDATIONS</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation is consistent with the 2013 USPSTF recommendation on vitamin D supplementation, with or without calcium, to prevent fractures.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/vitamin-d-calcium-or-combined-supplementation-for-the-primary-prevention-of-fractures-in-adults-preventive-medication#citation36""><span style=""font-size: small;"">36</span></a></sup> The USPSTF added evidence on calcium supplementation alone to the evidence review for this recommendation; however, the evidence was too limited to make a separate recommendation about calcium supplementation alone. Evidence from more recent studies confirms that the evidence on fracture prevention with doses of vitamin D greater than 400 IU daily is inconsistent and inadequate, because of underpowering of studies at higher doses. Newer evidence confirms an increased risk for kidney stones with combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation and also suggests no increased incidence of cardiovascular disease with vitamin D supplementation.</p>

16,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women aged 35 years or older without a prior diagnosis of breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). Neither tamoxifen nor raloxifene should be used in women who have a history of thromboembolic events (deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, stroke, or transient ischemic attack). The USPSTF has issued separate recommendations for women with BRCA gene mutations (available at <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).<a name=""risk""></a>
<h3>Assessment of Breast Cancer Risk</h3>
If a family history of breast cancer or a personal history of breast biopsy is found during the usual patient assessment, clinicians may consider further evaluation using a breast cancer risk assessment tool. Risk assessment tools specifically for family history of breast cancer are available elsewhere (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>). The National Cancer Institute has developed a Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (available at <a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool"">www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool</a>) that is based on the Gail model and estimates the 5-year incidence of invasive breast cancer in women on the basis of characteristics entered into a risk calculator. This tool helps identify women who may be at increased risk for the disease. Other risk assessment models have been developed by the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC), Rosner and Colditz, Chlebowski, Tyrer and Cuzick, and others. Examples of risk factors elicited by risk assessment tools include patient age, race or ethnicity, age at menarche, age at first live childbirth, personal history of DCIS or LCIS, number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer, personal history of breast biopsy, body mass index, menopause status or age, breast density, estrogen and progestin use, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, and diet. These models are not recommended for use in women with a personal history of breast cancer, a history of radiation treatment to the chest, or a possible family history of mutations in the <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> genes. Only a small fraction of women are at increased risk for breast cancer. Most who are at increased risk will not develop the disease, and most cases will arise in women who are not identified as being at increased risk. Risk assessment should be repeated when there is a significant change in breast cancer risk factors. There is no single cutoff for defining increased risk. Most clinical trials defined increased risk as a 5-year risk for invasive breast cancer of 1.66% or greater, as determined by the BCPT (Breast Cancer Prevention Trial). At this cutoff, however, many women would not have a net benefit from risk-reducing medications. Freedman and colleagues&nbsp;developed risk tables that incorporate the BCPT estimate of a woman's breast cancer risk as well as her age, race or ethnicity, and presence of uterus. On the basis of the Freedman risk&ndash;benefit tables for women aged 50 years or older (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/breastcanmeds/breastcanmedsrs4figs.htm"">Figures 2 to 5</a>), the USPSTF concludes that many women with an estimated 5-year breast cancer risk of 3% or greater are likely to have more benefit than harm from using tamoxifen or raloxifene, although the balance depends on age, race or ethnicity, the medication used, and whether the patient has a uterus.
<h3>Assessment of Risk for Adverse Effects</h3>
In general, women taking medications for breast cancer risk reduction are less likely to experience a VTE if they are younger and have no other predisposition to thromboembolic events. Women with a personal or family history of venous thromboembolism are at higher risk for these adverse effects.Women without a uterus are not at risk for tamoxifen-related endometrial cancer. Women with a uterus should have a baseline gynecologic examination prior to starting tamoxifen, with regular followup after the end of treatment.
<h3>Medications for Breast Cancer Risk Reduction</h3>
Selective estrogen receptor modulators (tamoxifen and raloxifene) have been shown to reduce the incidence of invasive breast cancer in several randomized, controlled trials. Tamoxifen has been approved for this use in women aged 35 years or older, and raloxifene has been approved for this use in postmenopausal women.The usual daily doses for tamoxifen and raloxifene are 20 mg and 60 mg, respectively, for 5 years. Aromatase inhibitors (exemestane) have not been approved by the FDA for this indication and are therefore beyond the scope of this recommendation.Tamoxifen is not recommended for use in combination with hormone therapy or hormonal contraception or in women who are pregnant, those who may become pregnant, or breastfeeding mothers.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
The USPSTF recommendation on risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA-related cancer can be found at <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>. Clinical trials of tamoxifen and raloxifene have not been conducted specifically in women who are BRCA mutation carriers.
<h3>Other Resources</h3>
The National Cancer Institute provides information about potential ways to prevent cancer, including lifestyle and diet changes (available at <a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/prevention/breast/Patient"">www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/prevention/breast/Patient</a> and <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/basic_info/prevention.htm"">www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/basic_info/prevention.htm</a>). The USPSTF does not endorse any particular risk prediction model. However, the BCPT model (<a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool"">www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool</a>) and the BCSC model (<a href=""https://tools.bcsc-scc.org/BC5yearRisk"">https://tools.bcsc-scc.org/BC5yearRisk</a>) can be used by clinicians and patients as part of the process of shared, informed decision making. Both models have been calibrated in U.S. populations.<a name=""other""></a>
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
In order to identify patients for whom the potential benefits of risk-reducing medications could outweigh potential risks, clinicians should first identify patients who may be at increased risk for breast cancer (see <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/breastcanmeds/breastcanmedsrs.htm#risk"">Assessment of Breast Cancer Risk</a>).  Clinicians may use this opportunity to educate all women about their risk for developing breast cancer; studies have shown that women tend to overestimate their individual breast cancer risk. For women whose 5-year projected risk for breast cancer is 3% or greater, clinicians should identify those for whom the potential benefits of risk-reducing medications may outweigh the potential risks. In doing so, clinicians should consider the woman's age, comorbid conditions, presence of uterus, and risks for thromboembolic or medication-related adverse events. Clinicians may refer to risk&ndash;benefit tables to complement clinical assessment (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/breastcanmeds/breastcanmedsrs4figs.htm"">Figures 2-5</a>).Clinicians should clearly discuss the potential benefits and risks of risk-reducing medications with women for whom the former may outweigh the latter. Clinicians should then strive to ensure that patients make a fully informed decision that incorporates their personal values and preferences, including their concerns about breast cancer and specific medication-related adverse events.
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Research to improve the ability to assess and accurately predict a woman's chance of developing breast cancer over a defined period is needed. The ideal candidates for risk-reducing medications are women who have not only a high probability of developing breast cancer over a defined period but also a low probability of thromboembolic and other medication-related adverse events. Models that can more precisely predict both of these events should be developed. Clinical trials that provide more information about the safety and effectiveness of other medications for breast cancer risk reduction, such as aromatase inhibitors and tibolone, are needed. The aromatase inhibitor exemestane reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women who were at moderately increased risk for the disease. There were no significant differences in the incidence of osteoporosis, cardiovascular events, other types of cancer, or death. However, these findings were reported from a randomized, clinical trial with a median follow-up of 3 years and will require long-term assessment. IBIS-II (International Breast Cancer Intervention Study II), an ongoing British study, is comparing the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole with placebo in women who are at increased risk for breast cancer. Additional research could help clarify the optimum treatment duration, timing, and dose. Future studies should examine the benefits and harms of risk-reducing medications in racially diverse patient populations.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/breastcanmeds/breastcanmedsrs.htm#consider,133,"In 2013, the American Society of Clinical Oncology recommended that tamoxifen should be discussed as an option to reduce risk for ER-positive breast cancer in women aged 35 years or older who are at increased risk for breast cancer. It also recommended that raloxifene and exemestane should be discussed as options for breast cancer risk reduction in postmenopausal women. In 2013, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended that clinicians offer tamoxifen or raloxifene for 5 years to postmenopausal women with a uterus who are at high risk for breast cancer unless they have a history of or may be at increased risk for thromboembolic disease or endometrial cancer. The guideline also included recommendations for different age and risk groups. In 2011, the American Cancer Society recommended that women who are considering medications for breast cancer risk reduction should discuss their personal health situations with their physicians. In 2001, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommended that women who are at high risk for breast cancer should receive counseling about the risks and benefits of tamoxifen for cancer prevention; it found fair evidence to recommend against the use of tamoxifen in women who are at low or normal risk for breast cancer.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/breastcanmeds/breastcanmedsrs.htm#recommendations,,Medications for Risk Reduction of Primary Breast Cancer in Women,"Breast Cancer, Preventive Medications, 2013",,,,,
17,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation statement applies to asymptomatic adults who do not recognize or report respiratory symptoms. It does not apply to at-risk persons who present to clinicians with symptoms such as chronic cough, sputum production, dyspnea, or wheezing. It also does not apply to persons with a family history of &alpha;1-antitrypsin deficiency.
<h3>Risk Assessment</h3>
Exposure to cigarette smoke or toxic fumes increases the risk for COPD. Epidemiological studies have found that 15% to 50% of smokers develop COPD.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation3"">3</a> More than 70% of all COPD cases occur in current or former smokers. Occupational exposure to toxins, dusts, or industrial chemicals contributes an estimated 15% of all COPD cases. Environmental pollution, including wood smoke and traffic pollutants, is also associated with increased risk for COPD. Nonmodifiable risk factors for COPD include history of asthma or childhood respiratory tract infections and &alpha;1-antitrypsin deficiency.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Screening adults in primary care involves either risk assessment via a formal prescreening questionnaire and, if positive, follow-up with diagnostic spirometry testing or screening spirometry administered without a bronchodilator and, if positive, follow-up with diagnostic spirometry testing. Patients identified as high risk by a prescreening questionnaire or screening spirometry are referred for diagnostic spirometry testing. Diagnosis by spirometry requires persistent airway obstruction after administration of an inhaled bronchodilator, such as albuterol (ie, postbronchodilator spirometry). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is diagnosed when the patient has a postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 0.70. Severity is defined by the percentage of predicted postbronchodilator FEV1; 80% or more is mild, 50% to 79% is moderate, 30% to 49% is severe, and less than 30% is very severe.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
Prevention of exposure to cigarette smoke and other toxic fumes is the best way to prevent COPD.&nbsp; Interventions to prevent the initiation of tobacco use are an effective way to prevent exposure to cigarette smoke. Current smokers should receive smoking cessation counseling and be offered behavioral and pharmacological therapies to stop smoking.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The USPSTF recommends that clinicians ask all adults, including pregnant women, about tobacco use and provide tobacco cessation interventions for those who use tobacco products. The USPSTF also recommends that clinicians provide interventions, including education or brief counseling, to prevent initiation of tobacco use in school-aged children and adolescents. These recommendations and their supporting evidence are available on the USPSTF website (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).",,164,"In 2011, the American College of Physicians, American College of Chest Physicians, American Thoracic Society, and European Respiratory Society issued joint guidelines recommending that spirometry be used to diagnose airflow obstruction in patients with respiratory symptoms.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation16"">16</a> The joint panel recommended against screening for COPD with spirometry in asymptomatic patients, citing the lack of benefit.

<p>About 14% of US adults aged 40 to 79 years have COPD, and it is the third leading cause of death in the United States.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation1"">1</a>, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-screening#citation2"">2</a>Persons with severe COPD are often unable to participate in normal physical activity due to deterioration of lung function.</p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is defined as airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lung to harmful particles or gases. Diagnosis is based on postbronchodilator spirometry, which detects fixed airway obstruction; a forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio of less than 0.70 is the current criterion for a positive COPD diagnosis. Persons with COPD often, but not always, have symptoms such as dyspnea (difficulty breathing or shortness of breath), chronic cough, and chronic sputum production. Patients often have a history of exposure to risk factors such as cigarette smoke or heating fuels or occupational exposure to dusts or chemicals. Although postbronchodilator spirometry is required to make a definitive diagnosis, prescreening questionnaires can elicit current symptoms and previous exposures to harmful particles or gases.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that screening for COPD in asymptomatic persons using questionnaires or spirometry improves health outcomes.</p>
<h3><strong>Harms of Detection and Early Treatment</strong></h3>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening. However, given the lack of benefit of early detection and treatment, the opportunity cost associated with screening asymptomatic persons may be large. The amount of time and effort required to screen for COPD in asymptomatic persons (using screening spirometry with or without prescreening questionnaires) is not trivial.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF determined that early detection of COPD, before the development of symptoms, does not alter the course of the disease or improve patient outcomes. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for COPD in asymptomatic persons has no net benefit. &nbsp;Thus, screening is not recommended in persons who do not have symptoms suggestive of COPD.&nbsp; The USPSTF recommends against screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults.</p>",Screening for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Screening, 2016",,,,,
18,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to school-aged children and adolescents. The USPSTF has issued a separate recommendation statement on tobacco use counseling in adults and pregnant women.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
In 2009, 8.2% of middle school students and 23.9% of high school students reported current use of any tobacco product. Although younger children may be susceptible to smoking, research indicates that adolescents may be especially vulnerable to nicotine addiction.The prevalence of current smoking in the United States is higher in male high school students (19.8%) than female students (19.1%). Two of the strongest factors associated with smoking initiation in children and adolescents are parental smoking and parental nicotine dependence. Other factors include low levels of parental monitoring, easy access to cigarettes, the perception that peers smoke, and exposure to tobacco promotions.
<h3>Interventions to Prevent Tobacco Use</h3>
The type and intensity of effective behavioral interventions substantially varied in the evidence review, ranging from no in-person interaction with a health care professional to 7 group sessions totaling more than 15 hours (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/tobacco/tbacfinalrs.htm#ref1"">1</a>). In 1 intervention, families received a packet of materials for parents and children and a 28-minute video with a viewing guide. These families received 1 counseling call 3 to 6 weeks after receiving the written materials and another call 14 months after enrollment. Another intervention consisted of creating a tobacco-free office and giving patients a series of antitobacco messages on preprinted &ldquo;prescription&rdquo; forms. The most intensive intervention focused on universal substance abuse and problem behavior prevention for families. In this intervention, the youth and at least 1 parent participated in 7 group and family sessions over 7 weeks (each session lasted 2 to 2.5 hours) and received workbooks with activities to complete at home.Even very minimal interventions, such as mailing materials to a youth's home, had substantial effects on reducing smoking initiation. One intervention mailed tailored newsletters addressed to the student every 3 weeks; another intervention sent age-related materials 4 times over 12 months. In a third intervention, participants were mailed 5 core activity guides with newsletters and tip sheets approximately every 2 weeks, with 1 booster guide at 1 year.Many interventions had similar content, such as the participant's attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge about smoking; the consequences of smoking; the influence of the social environment, including tobacco marketing; and skills to decline cigarettes. Several interventions targeted parental attitudes and beliefs about smoking and parent&ndash;child communication.
<h3>Interventions for Tobacco Cessation</h3>
Evidence on the effectiveness of cessation interventions delivered in primary care settings to school-aged children and adolescents who have experimented with smoking or are regular smokers is limited. The USPSTF examined the evidence on behavioral interventions to promote smoking cessation in children and adolescents who were classified as smokers. Few studies targeted regular, established smokers or stratified findings by length or amount of smoking (such as experimenters vs. established smokers). A pooled meta-analysis of 7 trials, which included 2328 children and adolescents and examined interventions to promote smoking cessation, found a small but statistically insignificant effect at 6- to 12-month follow-up favoring the intervention (risk ratio, 0.96 [95 CI%, 0.90 to 1.02]).Although evidence on the effectiveness of primary care&ndash;relevant interventions in reducing smoking in children and adolescents is limited, some evidence from other literature shows that school- and community-based behavioral counseling programs can promote smoking cessation in adolescent smokers. In a meta-analysis of 64 trials, 40 of which were school-based, Sussman and Sun found a 4% difference in smoking cessation rates between the intervention and control groups (11.8% vs. 7.5%, respectively). A longitudinal evaluation of 41 community-based programs reported biochemically validated cessation rates similar to those in randomized trials (averaging 14% at the end of the program and 12% at 12-month follow-up).No medications are currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for tobacco cessation in children and adolescents. Two studies that evaluated behavioral interventions plus medication (sustained-release bupropion alone or combined with nicotine replacement therapy) showed no statistically significant benefit from the medication. Evidence on complementary and alternative medicine, such as acupuncture, for smoking cessation in children and adolescents is not available, and such interventions have demonstrated no long-term benefits in adults.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention and Cessation</h3>
The Community Preventive Services Task Force has made the following 4 recommendations for school-aged children and adolescents.<ol>
<li>Mobile phone&ndash;based interventions for tobacco cessation, on the basis of sufficient evidence of their effectiveness in increasing abstinence from tobacco among persons interested in quitting, as well as community-wide, proactive telephone support (proactive follow-up) combined with patient education materials, on the basis of strong evidence of their effectiveness in increasing tobacco cessation in both clinical and community settings. However, the Community Preventive Services Task Force noted that the evidence on the effectiveness of both of these interventions for school-aged children and adolescents is limited.</li>
<li>Interventions that increase the price of tobacco products, on the basis of strong evidence of their effectiveness in reducing tobacco use in adolescents and adults, reducing population consumption of tobacco products, and increasing tobacco use cessation.</li>
<li>Mass media campaigns, on the basis of strong evidence of their effectiveness in reducing tobacco use in adolescents when combined with increases in tobacco prices, school-based education, and other community education programs.</li>
<li>Community mobilization combined with additional interventions (such as stronger local laws directed at retailers, active enforcement of retailer sales laws, and retailer education with reinforcement), on the basis of sufficient evidence of their effectiveness in reducing youth tobacco use and access to tobacco products from commercial sources.</li>
</ol>The Community Preventive Services Task Force also recommends provider reminder systems, whether used alone or as part of a multicomponent intervention, across a range of intervention characteristics (such as chart stickers, checklists, and flowcharts) and in various clinical settings and populations.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>

19,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to adults who do not have vision symptoms who are seen in a primary care setting.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
Increased IOP, family history of glaucoma, older age, and African American race increase a person's risk for open-angle glaucoma. Recent evidence shows that glaucoma may be increased in Hispanics. Older African Americans have a higher prevalence of glaucoma and perhaps a more rapid disease progression; if screening reduces vision impairment, then African Americans would probably have greater absolute benefit than whites.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Diagnosis of POAG is based on a combination of tests showing characteristic degenerative changes in the optic disc and defects in visual fields (often loss in peripheral vision). Although increased IOP was previously considered an important part of the definition of this condition, it is now known that many persons with POAG do not have increased IOP and not all persons with increased IOP have or will develop glaucoma. Therefore, screening with tonometry alone may be inadequate to detect all cases of POAG.Measurement of visual fields can be difficult. The reliability of a single measurement may be low; several consistent measurements are needed to establish the presence of defects. Specialists use dilated ophthalmoscopy or slit lamp examination to evaluate changes in the optic disc; however, even experts have varying ability to detect glaucomatous progression of the optic disc. In addition, no single standard exists to define and measure progression of visual field defects. Most tests that are available in a primary care setting do not have acceptable accuracy to detect glaucoma.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
The initial aim and efficacy assessment of primary treatments of POAG are reduction of IOP. Treatments include medication, laser therapy, and surgery. These treatments also effectively reduce the longer-term development and progression of small visual field defects as assessed by clinical examination. However, the magnitude of the effectiveness in reducing impairments in patient-reported, vision-related function, including development of blindness, is uncertain.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
Approximately 2.5 million persons in the United States have glaucoma, and approximately 1.9% of adults older than 40 years have open-angle glaucoma. Most persons with glaucoma have POAG. This condition is defined as optic neuropathy with a visibly open anterior chamber angle (between the iris and the anterior sclera or peripheral cornea) that is associated with progressive death of retinal ganglion cells and axons and visual field loss.The goal of screening programs is to identify and treat POAG before visual impairment develops. The proportion of persons who are currently unidentified and who will develop vision problems as a result of a diagnosis obtained through screening is not known. The natural history of glaucoma is heterogeneous and poorly defined.In some persons, POAG does not progress or progression is so slow that it never has an important effect on vision. The size of this subgroup is uncertain and may depend on the ethnicity and age of the population and initial findings of ophthalmologic testing. Screening in asymptomatic persons is likely to increase the size of this subgroup. Other patients have more rapid progression, as determined by optic nerve damage, visual field defects, and development of visual impairment.Whether early glaucoma will progress to visual impairment cannot be precisely predicted. Whether the rate of progression of visual field defects remains uniform throughout the course of glaucoma is also not known. Older adults and African Americans seem to be at increased risk and have more rapid progression. Persons with a short life expectancy probably have little to gain from glaucoma screening.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
Harms caused by treatment of glaucoma include formation of cataracts and those resulting from surgery and from topical medications. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment are possible because not all persons who are diagnosed with and treated for glaucoma progress to visual impairment; the magnitude of overdiagnosis and overtreatment is unknown.
<h4>Costs</h4>
The cost of screening varies widely depending on the tests used. Testing with hand-held tonometers and ophthalmoscopes can be done quickly and inexpensively. However, the diagnostic accuracy of these inexpensive tests is not known. According to the National Business Group on Health, the average screening eye examination costs $71. Screening with specialized tests for glaucoma and with newer computerized instruments is more expensive.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
Approximately 62% of Medicare patients enrolled in an HMO were screened for glaucoma in 2009. In 2008, approximately 53% of whites, 47% of African Americans, and 37% of Hispanics reported an annual eye care visit.<a name=""otherconsid""></a>
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
The natural history of glaucoma, particularly the role of IOP and its relationship to optic nerve damage, visual field defects, visual impairment, and blindness, is poorly understood. More evidence is needed on the link between the intermediate glaucoma outcomes of optic nerve damage and visual field loss and the final health outcomes of visual disability and patient-reported outcomes. Evidence for screening would ideally come from a randomized, controlled trial of routine (or targeted) screening versus standard care with long-term follow-up. More studies on treatment that are of adequate duration and size to assess important clinical outcomes (such as visual impairment and vision-related quality of life), or at least greater changes in visual fields, are needed.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/glaucoma/glaucomafinalrs.htm#consider,130,"The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends a comprehensive adult medical eye evaluation, including tests for glaucoma, with frequency depending on the patient's age and other risk factors for glaucoma.

21,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults aged 18 years or older who are seen by primary care providers. This recommendation focuses on screening (visual inspection and palpation) of the oral cavity performed by primary care providers and not dental providers or otolaryngologists.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
Tobacco and alcohol use are major risk factors for oral cancer. A total of 20% to 30% of cases of oral cancer worldwide are attributable to cigarette smoking. In the United States, up to 75% of cases of oral cancer may be attributable to tobacco and alcohol use. Additional risk factors include male sex, older age, use of betel quid, ultraviolet light exposure, infection with <em>Candida</em>or bacterial flora, and a compromised immune system.<br /><br />Sexually transmitted oral HPV infection (HPV-16) has recently been recognized as an increasingly important risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer. In the United States, the prevalence of oropharyngeal cancer due to oral HPV infection is probably as high as 80% to 95%. The prevalence of oral HPV infection is associated with age, sex, number of sexual partners, and number of cigarettes smoked per day. The effect of multifactorial risk assessment and screening for risk factors on oral cancer morbidity and mortality is unknown.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
The primary screening test for oral cancer is a systematic clinical examination of the oral cavity. According to the World Health Organization and the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, an oral cancer screening examination should include a visual inspection of the face, neck, lips, labial mucosa, buccal mucosa, gingiva, floor of the mouth, tongue, and palate. Mouth mirrors can help visualize all surfaces. The examination also includes palpating the regional lymph nodes, tongue, and floor of the mouth. Any abnormality that lasts for more than 2 weeks should be reevaluated and considered for biopsy. <br /><br />Oropharyngeal cancer is difficult to visualize and is usually located at the base of the tongue (the back third of the tongue), the soft palate (the back part of the roof of the mouth), the tonsils, and the side and back walls of the throat. A comprehensive examination of the oropharynx may require referral to a dental provider or specialist, which is outside the scope of this recommendation.<br /><br />Additional tests proposed as adjuncts to the oral cancer screening examination include toluidine blue dye staining, chemiluminescent and autofluorescent lighting devices, and brush cytopathology. These screening and adjunct tests have not been adequately tested in primary care nondental settings. Although there is interest in screening for oral HPV infection, medical and dental organizations do not recommend it. Currently, no screening test for oral HPV infection has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Evaluating the accuracy of tests that detect oral HPV infection is a potentially promising area of research.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
This recommendation is intended for primary care providers and does not pertain to dental providers or otolaryngologists. Dental care providers and otolaryngologists may conduct a comprehensive examination of the oral cavity and pharynx during the clinical encounter. In deciding whether to screen for oral cancer, primary care providers should consider the following factors. <br /><br /><em>Potential Preventable Burden</em> <br /><br />Up to 75% of cases of oral cancer may be attributed to tobacco and alcohol use. Since 1979, the incidence rate of oral cavity cancer in the United States has been decreasing because of the reduced consumption of alcohol and smoking prevalence. <br /><br />During this period, the incidence of HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinoma has increased. Cancer registry data have shown that from 1988 to 2004, HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancer has decreased from 2.0 cases to 1.0 case per 100,000 persons and HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer has increased more than 3-fold from 0.8 case to 2.6 cases per 100,000 persons. The overall prevalence of oral HPV infection is estimated to be 6.9% in adults aged 14 to 69 years in the United States. However, HPV prevalence can be as high as 20% for persons who have more than 20 lifetime sexual partners or currently use tobacco (more than 1 pack of cigarettes per day). <br /><br />The prevalence of type-specific HPV-16 oral infection is estimated at 1% in adults aged 14 to 69 years (an estimated 2.13 million infected persons). Human papillomavirus-16 is associated with approximately 85% to 95% of cases of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer. Therefore, the increasing role of oral HPV infection as a risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer may warrant future assessment of the independent effect of HPV-16 on incidence and outcomes of oropharyngeal cancer and the health effect of screening persons who are HPV-16&ndash;positive. <br /><br /><em>Potential Harms</em> <br /><br />Suspected oral cancer or its precursors (such as erythroplakia, due to its high risk for transformation to cancer) detected through examination require confirmation by tissue biopsy, which may lead to harms. Harms of treatment of screen-detected oral cancer and its potential precursors (leukoplakia and erythroplakia) may result from complications of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The natural history of screen-detected oral cancer is not well-understood, and as a result, the harms from overdiagnosis and overtreatment are unknown. <br /><br /><em>Current Practice<br /><br /></em>In a 2008 survey of U.S. adults, 29.4% of those aged 18 years or older reported ever having an oral cancer examination in which a physician, dentist, or other health professional pulled on their tongue or palpated their neck. It is unknown what percentage of these examinations were conducted by dentists rather than physicians or other health professionals. Adults aged 40 years or older are more likely to have ever had an examination than those aged 18 to 39 years, despite smoking status. Adults who are most at risk for oral cancer (current smokers aged &ge;40 years) are less likely to have ever had an oral cancer examination than former smokers or adults who have never smoked.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen all adults for tobacco use, recommend against tobacco use, and provide tobacco cessation interventions for those who use tobacco products. The USPSTF also recommends screening and behavioral counseling interventions in primary care settings to reduce alcohol misuse by adults.
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
One of the most important research needs is a randomized, controlled trial assessing the benefits and harms of oral cancer screening in U.S. persons who are at increased risk, such as those with a history of tobacco and heavy alcohol use. Continued research is needed to determine the accuracy of primary care providers, dental hygienists, dentists, or other trained persons screening U.S. patients who are at increased risk. Also needed is longitudinal follow-up of screening studies applicable to the United States that will show the health effect of screening for oral cancer and a clear understanding of who is at high risk in the United States. In addition, given the higher risks for death from oral cancer among African Americans and men, more research is warranted about the risks and benefits of screening in these populations. <br /><br />If HPV continues to become a more clinically significant risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer, the benefits of screening for HPV and selection of populations for oral cancer screening based on HPV status will need to be assessed. As the epidemiology evolves, the most effective screening examination will need to be determined. No screening test for oral HPV infection has been approved by the FDA. More research is needed to determine the benefits and harms of screening for oropharyngeal cancer. Other areas of research include learning about the natural history of oral HPV infection. <br /><br />Vaccines that reduce the risk for HPV infection are available. Whether current vaccines can prevent infection at noncervical sites and help reduce the risk for oropharyngeal cancer is unknown. Research is needed to assess the efficacy of HPV vaccines in preventing infection at noncervical sites and in decreasing the risk for oropharyngeal cancer.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/oralcan/oralcanfinalrec.htm#consider,136,"The American Academy of Family Physicians concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for oral cancer in asymptomatic adults. The American Cancer Society recommends that adults aged 20 years or older who have periodic health examinations should have the oral cavity examined as part of a cancer-related checkup. The American Dental Association recommends that providers remain alert for signs of potentially malignant lesions or early-stage cancer in patients during routine oral examinations, particularly for patients who use tobacco or have heavy alcohol consumption.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/oralcan/oralcanfinalrec.htm#discussion,,Screening for Oral Cancer,"Oral Cancer, Screening, 2013",,,,,
22,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to children and adolescents who do not have symptoms of hypertension.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
The strongest risk factor for primary hypertension in children and adolescents is elevated body mass index. Other risk factors include low birhweight, male sex, ethnicity, and family history of hypertension.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
In deciding whether to screen children and adolescents for hypertension, clinicians should consider the following. <br /><br /><em>Potential Preventable Burden</em> <br /><br />The increasing prevalence of hypertension in children and adolescents, possibly driven by childhood obesity, suggests that identification and treatment of hypertension is likely to become a significant health care issue. The goal of identifying and treating children and adolescents with primary hypertension can be viewed within a larger framework of adult cardiovascular risk reduction, which includes addressing other biometric risk factors, such as elevated body mass index and lipid profiles and hyperglycemia. The variables for cardiovascular risk reduction in adults are better understood because hypertension in adults is defined by relatively consistent quantitative thresholds, the epidemiologic evidence demonstrates the association between hypertension and subsequent cardiovascular risk, and treatment trials have shown that reduction in blood pressure reduces the risk for cardiovascular events in older adults. <br /><br />Extending the adult framework for cardiovascular risk reduction to children and adolescents is limited by several methodological challenges that complicate determining the potential preventable burden. Blood pressure percentiles are used to define normative values for children and adolescents, and less is known about the clinical and epidemiologic significance of these thresholds in terms of their association with adult cardiovascular disease. In addition, the performance characteristics of current methods for diagnosing hypertension during childhood are limited and of concern because of false-positive rates (blood pressure measurements that later normalize). Evidence on the association between childhood blood pressure and adult hypertension is limited, as is evidence on the longitudinal association between childhood blood pressure and other markers of adult cardiovascular disease. <br /><br />Most important, the limited data on treatment of hypertension in children and adolescents do not include longer-term follow-up to show reductions in surrogate, subclinical, or clinical measures of cardiovascular disease in either later adolescence or young adulthood. This limited evidence base makes it difficult to quantify the true significance and consequences of a hypertension diagnosis in children and adolescents and the potential benefit of early intervention. <br /><br />One rationale that has been suggested for screening is to identify secondary hypertension&mdash;a relatively rare condition resulting from another underlying cause, such as renal parenchymal disease or renovascular disease. Younger children are more likely than older children and adolescents to have a secondary cause of hypertension; a recent study suggests that secondary causes of hypertension are significantly more common in children younger than 6 years than in older children. Secondary hypertension is unlikely to be the only clinical manifestation of the underlying disorder in these cases, and management is primarily targeted at treating the underlying condition, as well as controlling hypertension. As children age into adolescence, 85% to 95% of all hypertension diagnoses are considered primary. <br /><br /><em>Potential Harms</em> <br /><br />Although 1 good-quality study suggests that no adverse effects are associated with hypertension detection in childhood, the evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of clinic-based screening for hypertension suggests that false-positive results may occur. Thus, unnecessary secondary evaluations or treatments may be common, particularly with frequent blood pressure screening. Pharmacologic interventions have been shown to be well-tolerated over relatively short periods. Treatment of hypertension in childhood and adolescence with pharmacologic agents is done for a much longer period, and adverse effects of such pharmacotherapy can occur. <br /><br /><em>Current Practice<br /><br /></em>Current screening practice for elevated blood pressure typically involves measurement of blood pressure in office-based health care settings as part of well-child or sports preparticipation examinations, often in conjunction with other vital signs and growth parameters. The National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP) percentile charts are used to interpret systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) measurements and categorize them as normal, prehypertension, or hypertension on the basis of the child's age, height, and sex for each year of the child's life from age 3 to 18 years.<br /><br />A 2012 study analyzing data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey assessed blood pressure screening during pediatric ambulatory office visits. It found that screening was done during 67% of preventive care visits and 35% of ambulatory visits. Screening was more common in children who were overweight or obese; 84% of these preventive care visits included screening for hypertension. It was also more likely to be done in older children.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
The consensus-based guidelines of the NHBPEP and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute define hypertension in children on the basis of percentiles according to age, height, and sex. Hypertension is defined as SBP or DBP at or above the 95th percentile. Hypertension is classified as stage 1 (SBP or DBP from 95th to 99th percentile, plus 5 mm Hg) or stage 2 (SBP or DBP &gt;99th percentile, plus 5 mm Hg). The NHBPEP provides guidance on optimal blood pressure measurement techniques, such as appropriate cuff size and type of sphygmomanometer. Blood pressure should be measured in a controlled environment after 5 minutes of rest, with the patient seated and the right arm supported at heart level.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
Stage 1 hypertension in children is treated with lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions. Medications are not recommended as first-line therapy. Lifestyle interventions for hypertension include weight reduction in children who are overweight or obese, increased physical activity, and restricted sodium intake, as well as education and counseling. The NHBPEP recommends medication for children with stage 2 hypertension or for hypertension that is unresponsive to lifestyle modification.<br /><br />Many medications have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hypertension in children, including diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, &beta;-blockers, and vasodilators.
<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>
Several organizations recommend routine screening of blood pressure at well-child visits starting at age 3 years, based on consensus.&nbsp;
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
There are several critical evidence gaps in better understanding the potential net benefit of screening for hypertension in childhood and adolescence. Evidence about the accuracy and reliability of blood pressure screening tools and protocols in primary care among children and adolescents of varying ages and characteristics, such as those who are obese, is needed. Comparative accuracy studies that examine the different types of devices to measure blood pressure, such as newer devices that obtain several readings in 1 visit, home-based devices, and ambulatory blood pressure measurement, are needed. In addition, screening strategies that reduce the rate of false-positive diagnoses of hypertension need to be identified. Studies on the adverse effects of screening are also needed. <br /><br />Prospective and retrospective cohort studies that include blood pressure measures and other cardiovascular risk factors in children and adolescents with long-term follow-up are needed to examine the adolescent and adult health outcomes of hypertension in childhood. Studies that elucidate the association among childhood hypertension, adult hypertension, and surrogate measures of cardiovascular disease in childhood and adulthood, as well as adult clinical cardiovascular disease, are also needed. <br /><br />Most important, evidence to ascertain the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of pharmacologic and lifestyle interventions to achieve sustained reductions in blood pressure and longer-term modification of adult hypertension and cardiovascular risk in children with primary hypertension is needed. Such studies should include longer follow-up intervals to determine the long-term effectiveness of these interventions in achieving sustained reductions in blood pressure during childhood and adolescence or reductions in future adult hypertension. Although trials with clinical cardiovascular end points are more challenging in children, treatment trials demonstrating changes in surrogate or subclinical cardiovascular outcomes during adolescence or young adulthood are feasible and warranted. Trials focusing on high-risk adolescent populations (such as those with obesity) that include longer-term follow-up with future hypertension and subclinical cardiovascular outcomes should be possible. Studies of treatment during childhood should include an assessment of medication harms, measures of long-term compliance, and study designs that examine individual components of multifactorial interventions.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/hypechild/hypechldfinalrec.htm#consider,135,"The American Academy of Pediatrics officially endorsed the NHBPEP 2004 recommendation that children aged 3 years and older have blood pressure measurement at least once at every &ldquo;health care episode&rdquo;.

23,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women who have not been diagnosed with BRCA-related cancer. <br /><br />Women who have 1 or more family members with a known potentially harmful mutation in the <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em>genes should be offered genetic counseling and testing.<br /><br />The USPSTF recognizes the potential importance of further evaluating women who have a diagnosis of breast or ovarian cancer. Some women receive genetic testing as part of a cancer evaluation at the time of diagnosis of breast cancer. The USPSTF did not review the appropriate use of BRCA testing in the evaluation of women who are newly diagnosed with breast cancer. That assessment is part of disease management and is beyond the scope of this recommendation. Women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer in the past and who did not receive BRCA testing as part of their cancer care but have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer should be encouraged to discuss further evaluation with their clinician.<br /><br />These recommendations do not apply to men, although male family members may be identified for testing during evaluation.
<h3>Family History Screening and Risk Assessment</h3>
Mutations in the BRCA genes cluster in families, exhibiting an autosomal dominant pattern of transmission in maternal or paternal lineage. During standard elicitation of family history information from patients, primary care providers should ask about specific types of cancer, primary cancer sites, which family members were affected, relatives with multiple types of primary cancer, and the age at diagnosis and sex of affected family members. <br /><br />For women who have at least 1 family member with breast, ovarian, or other types of BRCA-related cancer, primary care providers may use 1 of several brief familial risk stratification tools to determine the need for in-depth genetic counseling. <br /><br />Although several risk tools are available, the tools evaluated by the USPSTF include the Ontario Family History Assessment Tool (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/brcatest/brcatestfinalrstab.htm#tab1"">Table 1</a>), Manchester Scoring System (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/brcatest/brcatestfinalrstab.htm#tab2"">Table 2</a>), Referral Screening Tool (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/brcatest/brcatestfinalrstab.htm#tab3"">Table 3</a>), Pedigree Assessment Tool (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/brcatest/brcatestfinalrstab.htm#tab4"">Table 4</a>), and FHS-7 (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/brcatest/brcatestfinalrstab.htm#tab5"">Table 5</a>). The Referral Screening Tool (available at <a href=""http://www.breastcancergenescreen.org/"">www.breastcancergenescreen.org</a>) and FHS-7 are the simplest and quickest to administer. All of these tools seem to be clinically useful predictors of which women should be referred for genetic counseling due to increased risk for potentially harmful BRCA mutations (most sensitivity estimates were &gt;85%), although some models have been evaluated in only 1 study. To determine which patients would benefit from BRCA risk assessment, primary care providers should not use general breast cancer risk assessment models (for example, the National Cancer Institute Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool, which is based on the Gail model) because they are not designed to determine which women should receive genetic counseling or BRCA testing.<br /><br />In general, these tools elicit information about factors that are associated with increased likelihood of BRCA mutations. Family history factors associated with increased likelihood of potentially harmful BRCA mutations include breast cancer diagnosis before age 50 years, bilateral breast cancer, presence of breast and ovarian cancer, presence of breast cancer in 1 or more male family members, multiple cases of breast cancer in the family, 1 or more family members with 2 primary types of BRCA-related cancer, and Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity. The USPSTF recognizes that each risk assessment tool has limitations and found insufficient comparative evidence to recommend one tool over another. The USPSTF also found insufficient evidence to support a specific risk threshold for referral for testing.
<h3>Genetic Counseling</h3>
Genetic counseling about BRCA mutation testing may be done by trained health professionals, including trained primary care providers. Several professional organizations describe the skills and training necessary to provide comprehensive genetic counseling. The process of genetic counseling includes detailed kindred analysis and risk assessment for potentially harmful BRCA mutations; education about the possible results of testing and their implications; identification of affected family members who may be preferred candidates for testing; outlining options for screening, risk-reducing medications, or surgery for eligible patients; and follow-up counseling for interpretation of test results.
<h3>BRCA Mutation Testing</h3>
Adequate evidence suggests that current genetic sequencing tests can accurately detect BRCA mutations. Testing for BRCA mutations should be done only when an individual has personal or family history that suggests an inherited cancer susceptibility, when an individual has access to a health professional who is trained to provide genetic counseling and interpret test results, and when test results will aid in decision making. Initial testing of a family member who has breast or ovarian cancer is the preferred strategy in most cases, but it is reasonable to test if no affected relative is available. It is essential that before testing, the individual is fully informed about the implications of testing and has expressed a desire for it.<br /><br />The type of mutation analysis required depends on family history. Individuals from families with known mutations or from ethnic groups in which certain mutations are more common (for example, Ashkenazi Jewish women) can be tested for these specific mutations.<br /><br />Individuals without linkages to families or groups with known mutations receive more comprehensive testing. In these cases, when possible, testing should begin with a relative who has breast or ovarian cancer to determine whether affected family members have a clinically significant mutation.<br /><br />Tests for BRCA mutations are highly sensitive and specific for known mutations, but interpretation of results is complex and generally requires posttest counseling. Test results for genetic mutations are reported as positive (that is, potentially harmful mutation detected), variants of uncertain clinical significance, uninformative-negative, or true-negative. Women who have relatives with known BRCA mutations can be reassured about their inherited risk for a potentially harmful mutation if the results are negative (that is, a true negative). Some studies suggest increased breast cancer risk in some women with true-negative results. However, a comprehensive meta-analysis conducted for the USPSTF that included these studies found that breast cancer risk is generally not increased in women with true-negative results. An uninformative-negative result occurs when a woman's test does not detect a potentially harmful mutation but no relatives have been tested or no mutations have been detected in tested relatives. Available tests may not be able to identify mutations in these families. Risk for breast cancer is increased in women with uninformative-negative results.
<h3>Timing of Screening</h3>
Consideration of screening for potentially harmful BRCA mutations should begin once women have reached the age of consent (18 years). Primary care providers should periodically assess all patients for changes in family history (for example, comprehensive review at least every 5 to 10 years.
<h3>Interventions for Women Who Are BRCA Mutation Carriers</h3>
Interventions that may reduce risk for cancer or cancer-related death in women who are BRCA mutation carriers include earlier, more frequent, or intensive cancer screening; risk-reducing medications (for example, tamoxifen or raloxifene); and risk-reducing surgery (for example, mastectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy). However, the strength of evidence varies across the types of interventions. <br /><br />Evidence is lacking on the effect of intensive screening for BRCA-related cancer on clinical outcomes in women who are BRCA mutation carriers. Medications, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene, have been shown to reduce the incidence of invasive breast cancer in high-risk women in the general population, but they have not been studied specifically in women who are BRCA mutation carriers. <br /><br />In high-risk women and those who are BRCA mutation carriers, cohort studies of risk-reducing surgery (mastectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy) showed substantially reduced risk for breast or ovarian cancer. Breast cancer risk was reduced by 85% to 100% with mastectomy and by 37% to 100% with oophorectomy, and ovarian cancer risk was reduced by 69% to 100% with oophorectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy. Salpingo-oophorectomy was also associated with a 55% relative reduction in all-cause mortality (as measured during the course of the study) in women with <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em>mutations and without a history of breast cancer.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
The USPSTF recommendations on medications for breast cancer risk reduction are available on the USPSTF Web site (www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org).<br /><br />The USPSTF recommends against screening for ovarian cancer in women. This recommendation does not apply to women with known genetic mutations that increase their risk for ovarian cancer (for example, BRCA mutations).
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The National Cancer Institute Cancer Genetics Services Directory provides a list of professionals who offer services related to cancer genetics, including cancer risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic susceptibility testing (available at <a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/genetics/directory"">http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/genetics/directory</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
Although some studies have reported that women prefer in-person genetic counseling, telephone- or computer-based counseling may be considered for women who would not otherwise have access to these services.
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Research on risk assessment and testing for BRCA mutations has focused on short-term outcomes for highly selected women in referral centers. Additional studies are needed, including comparative effectiveness trials of approaches to risk screening and strategies to improve access to genetic counseling and BRCA testing for high-risk individuals. <br /><br />Another unresolved question is what specific training is needed (for persons other than trained genetic counselors) to provide genetic counseling. It would be helpful to understand which methods of delivery of genetic counseling are most effective, including those that can increase access to genetic counseling in rural or other settings. Trials comparing types of providers and protocols could address these questions. <br /><br />What happens after patients are identified as high-risk in clinical settings is unknown. The consequences of genetic testing for individuals and their relatives require more study. Well-designed investigations using standardized measures and diverse study populations are needed. <br /><br />An expanded database or registry of patients receiving genetic counseling for inherited breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility or who are tested for BRCA mutations would provide useful information about predictors of cancer and response to interventions. Additional data are needed from women of varying socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic groups. <br /><br />For women who are mutation carriers, studies about the effectiveness of intensive cancer screening and risk-reducing medications and the effects of age at intervention on improving long-term outcomes are needed. This research would increase knowledge of the relative benefits and harms of interventions that are provided on the basis of genetic risk information.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/brcatest/brcatestfinalrs.htm#consider,134,"The National Comprehensive Cancer Network provides specific criteria for genetic counseling and testing. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends genetic risk assessment for women who have more than a 20% to 25% risk for an inherited predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer and states that it may be helpful for patients with more than a 5% to 10% risk. The American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends genetic testing when there is personal or family history suggestive of genetic cancer susceptibility, the test can be adequately interpreted, and the results will aid in diagnosis or medical management of the patient or family member who has hereditary risk for cancer. It also recommends genetic testing only when pretest and posttest counseling are included. The National Society of Genetic Counselors has issued practice guidelines for risk assessment and genetic counseling for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. It recommends that genetic testing should be offered to individuals with a personal or family history suggestive of an inherited cancer syndrome, when the test can be adequately interpreted, if testing will influence medical management of the patient or relative, when potential benefits outweigh potential risks, if testing is voluntary, and when the individual seeking testing or a legal proxy can provide informed consent. The European Society for Medical Oncology recommends that all patients who may be referred for BRCA testing should first complete informed consent and genetic counseling and patients who are mutation carriers should be encouraged to advise close family members to obtain genetic counseling. The Society of Gynecologic Oncologists recommends genetic risk assessment for individuals with a personal risk of more than approximately 20% to 25% for an inherited predisposition to cancer and states that it may be helpful for patients with more than approximately 5% to 10% risk. Genetic testing for cancer predisposition requires informed consent that should encompass pretest education and counseling about the risks, benefits, and limitations of testing, including the implications of both positive and negative genetic test results.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/brcatest/brcatestfinalrs.htm#recommendations,,"Risk Assessment, Genetic Counseling, and Genetic Testing for BRCA-Related Cancer","BRCA-Related Cancer, Risk Assessment, Genetic Counseling, and Genetic Testing, 2013",,,,,

<br /><br />
<h3>Patient Population under Consideration</h3>
While the rate of illicit drug use in the U.S. is highest between the ages of 18 to 20 years, more than 10% of adolescents aged 12 to17 are known to use illicit drugs.&nbsp; The percentage of adults who regularly use illicit drugs decreases steadily with age. About 5% of pregnant women report using illicit drugs within the past month.
<h3>Patterns of Drug Use</h3>
Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States, with about 6% of the population age 12 and older admitting to use within the past month. While cocaine is the second most commonly used illicit drug, it is used by less than 1% of the population.&nbsp; Only a small minority of Americans use hallucinogens, inhalants, heroin, or illicitly manufactured methamphetamine, although the potential for abuse of or dependence on these substances is high. &nbsp;Illicit (non-medical) use of prescription-type drugs, categorized as pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives, is a growing health problem in the U.S.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
While clinicians should be alert to the signs and symptoms of illicit drug use in patients, the added benefit of screening asymptomatic patients in primary care practice remains unclear. Toxicologic tests of blood or urine can provide objective evidence of drug use, but such tests do not distinguish between occasional users and those who are impaired by drug use. A few brief, standardized questionnaires have been shown to be valid and reliable in screening adolescent and adult patients for drug use/misuse. However, the clinical utility of these questionnaires is uncertain. The reported positive predictive values are variable and at best 83% when the questionnaires are applied in a general medical clinic. Moreover, the feasibility of routinely incorporating the questionnaires into busy primary care practices has yet to be assessed. The validity, reliability, and clinical utility of standardized questionnaires in screening for illicit drug use during pregnancy have not been adequately evaluated.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
Although drug-specific pharmacotherapy (e.g., buprenorphine for opiate abuse) and/or behavioral interventions (e.g., brief motivational counseling for cannabis misuse) have been proven effective in reducing illicit drug use in the short term, &nbsp;the longer-term effects of treatment on morbidity and mortality have been inadequately evaluated.&nbsp; Moreover, these treatments have been studied almost exclusively in individuals who have already developed medical, social, or legal problems due to drug use, and their effectiveness in individuals identified through screening remains unclear. In all but one trial, treatment was delivered outside the primary care setting, often in specialized treatment facilities. More evidence is needed on the effectiveness of office-based treatments for illicit drug use/dependence.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
While interventions to prevent or reduce illicit drug use have been proposed for use in schools and sites of employment, evidence assessing preventive measures delivered in settings other than primary care practice was outside the scope of the USPSTF review. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Task Force on Community Preventive Services has announced plans to assess the effectiveness of selected population-based interventions for preventing or reducing abuse of drugs (other than tobacco and alcohol) and to make recommendations based on these findings.",http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf08/druguse/drugrs.htm#clinical,82,"<strong>This recommendation was partially updated for children and adolescents in 2014. For updated information on children and adolescents, see</strong><br /><strong><a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsnonmed.htm"">http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsnonmed.htm</a>.</strong><br /><br /><br />Several professional groups have recommended screening adolescents for drug use. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pediatricians incorporate substance-abuse prevention into daily practice, acquire the skills necessary to identify young people at risk of substance abuse, and provide or facilitate assessment, intervention and treatment as necessary. The American Medical Association's (AMA) Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services (GAPS) recommends that providers screen adolescents for substance abuse during annual preventive services visits, using age-specific questionnaires that include items related to drug use in the previous six months (www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/1980.html). In addition, the Bright Futures initiative includes a recommendation that all adolescents be screened for substance use as part of an overall psychosocial history.&nbsp; It suggests that practices use the CRAFFT questionnaire or the patient self-administered Drug and Alcohol Problem Quick Screen (DAP) (www.brightfutures.org). The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) recommends direct questioning by clinicians of all patients about their use of drugs (as well as tobacco and alcohol) as part of periodic assessments.&nbsp; The use of screening instruments adapted from questionnaires initially developed for use in detecting alcohol abuse is suggested, although no specific instrument is specified.",http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf08/druguse/drugrs.htm#recommendations,"<p><strong>Importance:</strong>&nbsp; Illicit drug use and abuse are serious problems among adolescents, adults, and pregnant women in the United States, ranking among the 10 leading preventable risk factors for years of healthy life lost to death and disability in developed countries. &nbsp;(Please note that tobacco use and alcohol misuse are considered in separate screening recommendations of the USPSTF.) <br /><br /><strong>Detection:</strong>&nbsp; While standardized questionnaires to screen adolescents and adults for drug use/misuse have been shown to be valid and reliable, there is insufficient evidence to assess the clinical utility of these instruments when applied widely in primary care settings. <br /><br /><strong>Benefits of detection and early treatment:</strong>&nbsp; There is good evidence that various treatments are effective in reducing illicit drug use in the short term. Evidence is insufficient, however, either to demonstrate that treatment reliably improves social and legal outcomes for patients, or to link treatment directly to longer term improvements in morbidity or mortality. Since all but one published clinical trial of treatment interventions involved individuals who had already developed problems due to their drug use, it is not known whether the findings are generalizable to asymptomatic individuals whose illicit drug use is detected through screening. There is fair evidence that, regardless of the patient's history of treatment, reducing or stopping drug use is associated with improvement in some health outcomes.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>Harms of detection and early treatment: </strong>&nbsp;There is little evidence of harms associated with either screening for illicit drug use or behavioral interventions used in treatment. Several clinical trials of pharmacotherapy for drug misuse have reported mild to serious adverse events, although some of these events were likely related to underlying drug use. The specific adverse events noted to occur more frequently in the treatment arm of trials (compared to placebo) have been previously recognized as potential side effects of the treatment medication and cited on its product label. <br /><br /><strong>USPSTF assessment:</strong> The USPSTF concludes that for&nbsp;adults and pregnant women, the evidence is insufficient to determine the benefits and harms of screening for illicit drug use.&nbsp; <em><br /><br />This recommendation was partially updated for children and adolescents in 2014.

25,"<h3>Patient Population under Consideration</h3> <p>This recommendation addresses screening for bacterial
vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant women.</p>
 <h3>Risk Assessment</h3>
<p>Several factors have been associated with increased risk
for preterm delivery. All of these associations are small to
moderate. These factors include, but are not limited to,
African-American race or ethnicity, body mass index less
than 20 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, previous preterm delivery, vaginal bleeding,
a short cervix (&lt;2.5 cm), pelvic infection, and bacterial
vaginosis. These factors can act in isolation or in combination.
Furthermore, bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy is
more common among African-American women, women
of low socioeconomic status, and those who have previously
delivered low-birthweight infants. For the purpose of
the current recommendation, women were considered to
be at low risk if they had no previous preterm delivery or
other risk factors for preterm delivery (often these were
nulliparous women). Women were considered to be at
high risk if they had a previous preterm delivery.</p>
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
<p>Bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed by using the Amsel
clinical criteria or Gram stain. With the Amsel criteria, the
clinical diagnosis is made by fulfilling 3 of 4 criteria: vaginal
pH greater than 4.7, the presence of clue cells on wet
mount, thin homogeneous discharge, and amine &quot;fishy
odor&quot; when potassium hydroxide is added to the discharge.</p>
<h3>Suggestions for Practice</h3>
<p>This recommendation statement addresses screening for
bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic women. Treatment of
symptomatic cases should be based on the clinical situation.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Oral metronidazole and oral clindamycin, as well as
vaginal metronidazole gel or clindamycin cream, are used
to treat bacterial vaginosis. The optimal treatment regimen
for pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis is unclear.
Refer to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Web site for current treatment recommendations (www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2006/vaginal-discharge.htm#vagdis2).</p>
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
 <h3>Research Needs</h3> <p> 
There are several evidence gaps in the literature on screening
and treating bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant
women. A critical gap in the evidence exists in demonstrating
a benefit of treatment in asymptomatic pregnant women at
increased risk for preterm delivery. Available evidence on
treatment benefit is conflicting. Additional research is needed
to evaluate the benefit of screening and treating asymptomatic
bacterial vaginosis in women at highest risk for preterm delivery.
Research is also needed to assess which screening tests
providers use to diagnose bacterial vaginosis in clinical practice
and the accuracy of these tests. Finally, continued research is
needed to determine the optimal treatment regimen for bacterial
vaginosis.</p>",http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf08/bv/bvrs.htm#clinical,83,"<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group,

screening and treatment of pregnant women with bacterial
vaginosis. All recommend against routine screening
for bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant women.
With respect to women at high risk for preterm delivery,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American
Academy of Family Physicians, and British Association for
Sexual Health and HIV state that there may be high-risk
women for whom screening and treatment may be beneficial.

26,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
The focus of this recommendation is healthy adults without special nutritional needs. Populations studied were typically aged 50 years or older. This recommendation does not apply to children, women who are pregnant or may become pregnant, or persons who are chronically ill or hospitalized or have a known nutritional deficiency.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4><em>Potential Preventable Burden </em></h4>
Evidence from in vitro and animal research and population-based epidemiologic studies supports the hypothesis that oxidative stress may play a fundamental role in the initiation and progression of cancer and common cardiovascular diseases. If this hypothesis is correct, then some combination of specific supplements, a specific dose, a vulnerable host, and specific timing may be found to be useful.
<h4><em>Potential Harms</em></h4>
Important harms have been shown with the use of &beta;-carotene in persons who smoke tobacco or have an occupational exposure to asbestos. There are several known adverse effects caused by excessive doses of vitamins; for example, moderate doses of vitamin A supplements may reduce bone mineral density, but high doses may be hepatotoxic or teratogenic. Otherwise, the vitamins reviewed by the USPSTF had few known risks. Because many of these vitamins are fat soluble, the lifetime effect of high doses should be taken into consideration.<br /><br />The USPSTF did not address doses higher than the tolerable upper intake level, as determined by the U.S. Food and Nutrition Board. Vitamins A and D have known harms at doses exceeding the tolerable upper intake levels, and the potential for harm from other supplements at high doses should be carefully considered. <br /><br />The U.S. Pharmacopeia has developed reference standards to aid in quality control of dietary supplement production; however, the content and concentration of ingredients in commercially available formulations probably vary considerably. This variability in the composition of dietary supplements makes extrapolating results obtained from controlled clinical trials challenging.
<h4><em>Costs </em></h4>
Although dietary supplements themselves are not particularly costly, the cumulative effect of this class of agent on spending is substantial. In 2010, $28.1 billion was spent on dietary supplements in the United States.
<h4><em>Current Practice </em></h4>
Surveys conducted by the dietary supplement industry suggest that many physicians and nurses have recommended dietary supplements to their patients for health and wellness.
<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>
Appropriate intake of vitamin and mineral nutrients is essential to overall health. Despite the uncertain benefit of vitamin supplementation, the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggest that nutrients should come primarily from foods and provide guidance on how to consume a nutrient-rich diet. Adequate nutrition by eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fat-free and low-fat dairy products, and seafood has been associated with a reduced risk for cardiovascular disease and cancer. <br /><br />Specific groups of patients with well-defined conditions may benefit from specific nutrients. For example, women planning or capable of pregnancy should receive a daily supplement containing folic acid to help prevent neural tube defects. The USPSTF also recommends vitamin D supplements for older persons at risk for falling.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The USPSTF has a large portfolio of recommendations for prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer, including recommendations for smoking cessation; screening for lipid disorders, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer; obesity screening and counseling; and aspirin use (available at <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>). <br /><br />
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
A critical gap in the evidence is the lack of studies of multivitamin combinations in groups generalizable to the U.S. population. Two randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) of multivitamin supplements suggest a potential cancer prevention benefit in men but not women. Future trials should be more representative of the general population, including women and minority groups, and should have enough power to show whether there are true subgroup differences. Targeting research toward persons who can be identified as high-risk for nutrient deficiency rather than the general population may be more productive. <br /><br />There are substantial challenges to studying nutrient supplementation by using methods similar to those used in studying pharmaceutical interventions. New and innovative research methods for examining effects of nutrients that account for the unique complexities of nutritional research but maintain rigorous designs should be explored. <br /><br />The paucity of studies and general lack of effect of any single nutrient or nutrient pair makes it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions on the balance of benefits and harms without a coordinated research effort and focus. A general lack of standardized methods to determine relevant serum nutrient levels, agreement on thresholds for sufficiency and insufficiency, or predictive validity of current mechanistic models further hinders progress in understanding potential benefits of dietary supplements.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf14/vitasupp/vitasuppfinalrs.htm#consider,139,"An independent consensus panel sponsored by the National Institutes of Health concluded that the present evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against the use of multivitamins to prevent chronic disease. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (formerly the American Dietetic Association) noted in a 2009 position statement that, although multivitamin supplements may be useful in meeting the recommended levels of some nutrients, there is no evidence that they are effective in preventing chronic disease. <br /><br />The American Cancer Society found that current evidence does not support the use of dietary supplements for the prevention of cancer. The American Institute for Cancer Research determined in 2007 that dietary supplements are not recommended for cancer prevention and recommended a balanced diet with a variety of foods rather than supplements. <br /><br />The American Heart Association recommends that healthy persons receive adequate nutrients by eating a variety of foods rather than supplementation.

27,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
These recommendations apply to pregnant women who have not been previously diagnosed with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
Several factors increase a woman's risk for developing GDM, including obesity, increased maternal age, history of GDM, family history of diabetes, and belonging to an ethnic group that has increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (Hispanic, Native American, South or East Asian, African American, or Pacific Island descent).<br /><br />Factors associated with a lower risk for developing GDM include age younger than 25 to 30 years, white race, a body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2or less, no family history (that is, in a first-degree relative) of diabetes, and no history of glucose intolerance or adverse pregnancy outcomes related to GDM.
<h3>Screening</h3>
There are 2 strategies used to screen for gestational diabetes in the United States. In the 2-step approach, the 50-g OGCT is performed between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation in a nonfasting state. If the screening threshold is met or exceeded (130, 135, or 140 mg/dL [7.21, 7.49, or 7.77 mmol/L]), patients receive the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). During the OGTT, a fasting glucose level is obtained, followed by administration of a 100-g glucose load, and glucose levels are evaluated after 1, 2, and 3 hours. A diagnosis of GDM is made when 2 or more glucose values fall at or above the specified glucose thresholds. Alternatively, in the 1-step approach, a 75-g glucose load is administered after fasting and plasma glucose levels are evaluated after 1 and 2 hours. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed if 1 glucose value falls at or above the specified glucose threshold.
<h3>Timing of Screening</h3>
Screening is recommended after 24 weeks of gestation. Screening for GDM may occur earlier than 24 weeks of gestation in high-risk women, but there is little evidence about the benefits and harms of screening before 24 weeks of gestation.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
Initial treatment includes moderate physical activity, dietary changes, support from diabetes educators and nutritionists, and glucose monitoring. If the patient's glucose is not controlled after these initial interventions, she may be prescribed medication (either insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents), or have increased surveillance in prenatal care or changes in delivery management.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
In deciding whether to screen for GDM before 24 weeks of gestation, primary care providers should consider the following.
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
Gestational diabetes affects about 240,000 (7%) of the 4 million annual births in the United States. Pregnant women with GDM are at increased risk for maternal and fetal complications and may benefit from early identification and treatment. Women with GDM are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
Potential harms of screening for gestational diabetes include psychological harms and intensive medical interventions (induction of labor, cesarean delivery, or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit). Possible adverse effects of treatment include neonatal or maternal hypoglycemia and maternal stress.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
A cross-sectional study reported that universal screening is the most common practice in the United States, with 96% of obstetricians routinely screening for GDM. Some women are screened earlier than 24 weeks of gestation because they have risk factors for type 2 diabetes, such as obesity, family history of type 2 diabetes, or fetal macrosomia during a previous pregnancy. <br /><br />If a pregnant woman presents in the first trimester or in early pregnancy with risk factors for type 2 diabetes, clinicians should use their clinical judgment to determine what is appropriate screening for that individual patient given her health needs and the insufficient evidence.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
Most pregnant women should be encouraged to attain moderate gestational weight gain, based on their prepregnancy BMI, and to participate in physical activity based on their clinician's recommendations. The Institute of Medicine has made recommendations for weight gain during pregnancy based on prepregnancy BMI.<a name=""other""></a>
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
More research is needed to directly evaluate screening for GDM and maternal and infant health outcomes. Research is also needed to help determine the most beneficial glucose thresholds for a positive screen and treatment targets. Continued research is needed to examine alternative screening methods, such as glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measurement and risk factor&#8210;based assessment. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the effect of different treatments for GDM on longer-term metabolic maternal and infant outcomes, such as persistent maternal glucose intolerance after delivery and type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity in the mother and infant. The use of a consistent strategy for screening for and diagnosing GDM in studies would allow for better comparisons of treatment outcomes across clinical trials. <br /><br />The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in women of reproductive age merits consideration of preconception screening for overt diabetes in women who are at risk for type 2 diabetes. Additional studies are needed to determine whether identifying and treating glucose intolerance before 24 weeks of gestation reduces maternal and fetal complications at delivery or leads to improved long-term health outcomes. For example, a follow-up to the Mild GDM Trial is examining whether different types of interventions in pregnant women with mild GDM decreases the risk for obesity in their children.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/gdm/gdmfinalrs.htm#consider,138,"In 2013, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended screening all pregnant women with a patient history or the 50-g OGCT. The American Diabetes Association endorses glucose testing for GDM in all pregnant women who do not have a prepregnancy diagnosis of diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation using a 75-g 2-hour OGTT with thresholds proposed by the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups. In 2013, an independent panel supported by the National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Program considered whether using the 75-g OGTT (1-step approach), as proposed by the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups and supported by the American Diabetes Association, should be adopted instead of the 2-step approach. The panel released a statement that there is not enough evidence to adopt a 1-step approach. The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends screening for GDM in asymptomatic pregnant women after 24 weeks of gestation. It also concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for GDM in asymptomatic pregnant women before 24 weeks of gestation. The Endocrine Society recommends universal screening for GDM using the OGTT at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/gdm/gdmfinalrs.htm#recommendations,,Screening for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus,"Gestational Diabetes Mellitus, Screening, 2014",,,,,

<h3><strong>Patient Population Under Consideration</strong></h3>
This recommendation applies to pregnant women, new mothers, and their infants and children. Interventions to support breastfeeding may also involve a woman's partner, other family members, and friends. This recommendation does not apply in circumstances where there are contraindications to breastfeeding (e.g., certain maternal medical conditions or infant metabolic disorders, such as galactosemia). The USPSTF did not review evidence on interventions directed at breastfeeding of preterm infants.
<h3><strong>Interventions</strong></h3>
Breastfeeding support can begin during pregnancy and continue through the early life of the child. Primary care clinicians can support women before and after childbirth by providing interventions directly or through referral to help them make an informed choice about how to feed their infants and to be successful in their choice. Interventions include promoting the benefits of breastfeeding, providing practical advice and direct support on how to breastfeed, and providing psychological support. Interventions can be categorized as professional support, peer support, and formal education, although none of these categories are mutually exclusive, and interventions may be combined within and between categories.
<h4><em>Professional Support</em></h4>
Professional support is 1-on-1 counseling about breastfeeding provided by a health professional (medical, nursing, or allied professionals, including those providing lactation care). Some interventions include the provision of supplies, such as educational materials, nursing bras, and breast pumps. Professional support can include providing information about the benefits of breastfeeding, psychological support (encouraging the mother, providing reassurance, and discussing the mother&rsquo;s questions and problems), and direct support during breastfeeding observations (helping with the positioning of the infant and observing latching). Professional support may be delivered during pregnancy, the hospital stay, the postpartum period, or at multiple stages. It may be conducted in an office setting, in the hospital, through home visits, through telephone support, or any combination of these. Sessions generally last from 15 to 45 minutes, although some programs have used shorter or longer sessions. Most successful interventions include multiple sessions and are delivered at more than 1 point in time.
<h4><em>Peer Support</em></h4>
Similar to professional support, peer support provides women with 1-on-1 counseling about breastfeeding but is delivered by a layperson (generally a mother with successful breastfeeding experience and a background similar to that of the patient) who has received training in how to provide support. Like professional support, peer support may be delivered through a variety of stages, settings, methods, and durations.
<h4><em>Formal Education</em></h4>
Formal education interventions typically include a formalized program to convey general breastfeeding knowledge, most often in the prenatal period, although some may span time periods. Education is usually offered in group sessions and may include telephone support, electronic interventions, videos, and print materials. They are directed at mothers but may include other family members. Content generally focuses on the benefits of breastfeeding, practical breastfeeding skills (e.g., latching), and the management of common breastfeeding complications; these programs may also offer family members encouragement and advice on how to support the mother.
<h3><strong>Useful Resources</strong></h3>
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides information on different breastfeeding intervention strategies, including program examples and resources.<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation2"">2</a>&nbsp;Another resource is the Surgeon General&rsquo;s ""Call to Action to Support Breastfeeding"".<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation3"">3</a></div>",,173,"<h3><em><strong>Other Considerations</strong></em></h3>
<h3><strong>Implementation</strong></h3>
<p>Although there is moderate certainty that breastfeeding is of moderate net benefit to women and their infants and children, not all women choose to or are able to breastfeed. Clinicians should, as with any preventive service, respect the autonomy of women and their families to make decisions that fit their specific situation, values, and preferences.In addition to clinicians&rsquo; direct activities to support breastfeeding, there are system-level interventions intended to promote breastfeeding. System-level interventions include policies, programs, and staff training, usually implemented within hospitals or health care systems. The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative is the most widely implemented system-level intervention and is based on the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund (UNICEF) ""10 Steps to Successful Breastfeeding for Hospitals"".<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation4"">4</a>&nbsp;Other system-level interventions include maternity care practices such as encouraging skin-to-skin contact, rooming-in, restricted pacifier use, and distributing breast pumps. Community-based interventions include social marketing initiatives, workplace initiatives, and public policy actions. A comprehensive review of the evidence on the effectiveness of these types of system-level interventions for the purposes of making a recommendation is beyond the scope of the USPSTF. A focused review of system-level interventions is included in the full evidence report,<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation5"">5</a>and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also provides information about individual, system-level, and community-based interventions.<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation6"">6</a></p>
<h3><strong>Research Needs and Gaps</strong></h3>
<p>To better assess how population-level interventions would affect breastfeeding rates, future studies should include women who have not already declared their intention to breastfeed. To better understand the effects of different interventions and patient populations, future research should include adequate sample sizes, clear descriptions of the included populations and comparators, and standardized reporting of outcomes. Studies would be more useful if they are designed to allow assessment of the relative contributions of individual components of multicomponent breastfeeding support programs. Trials should include reliable and valid measures of infant and maternal health outcomes and be powered to detect potential effects on these outcomes. Studies also should explore maternal satisfaction with the intervention and any potential negative feelings or feelings of inadequacy that could result if mothers choose not to or are unable to breastfeed. Studies in populations with low breastfeeding rates are especially needed, and more research is needed to better understand the root causes of breastfeeding disparities and how they can be addressed through health care and community interventions. Other areas for research include the potential benefits and harms of supporting indirect breastfeeding (e.g., use of breast pumps), the role of breastfeeding support for adoptive or surrogate families, the role of systems to distribute donor breast milk, and the effect of new technologies to support breastfeeding (e.g., web- or computer-based interventions).</p>
<h3><em>Update of USPSTF Recommendations</em></h3>
<p>This recommendation updates the 2008 USPSTF recommendation on primary care interventions to promote and support breastfeeding. The scope of the review and type of interventions recommended did not change. The grade of the recommendation remains a B.</p>
<h3><em>Recommendations of Others</em></h3>
<p>Several national and international organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP),<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation15"">15</a>&nbsp;the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG),<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation16"">16</a>&nbsp;and WHO/UNICEF,<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation17"">17</a>&nbsp;recommend exclusive breastfeeding up to around 6 months, followed by continued breastfeeding for at least 1 year, as mutually desired by mother and infant, while complementary foods are introduced. ACOG also recommends that all obstetrician-gynecologists and other providers of obstetric care develop and maintain knowledge and skills in anticipatory guidance and support each woman&rsquo;s informed decision about whether to initiate or continue breastfeeding. ACOG endorses the integration of the WHO/UNICEF ""10 Steps to Successful Breastfeeding"" into maternity care to increase the likelihood that women achieve their personal breastfeeding goals.<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation16"">16</a>&nbsp;AAP recommends that pediatricians serve as breastfeeding advocates and educators, provides resources that pediatricians can use in their practices, and endorses the WHO/UNICEF ""10 Steps to Successful Breastfeeding"".<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation15"">15</a>&nbsp;The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends providing interventions during pregnancy and after birth to support breastfeeding.<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation18"">18</a>&nbsp;The National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners endorses the optimization of infant breastfeeding and breastfeeding promotion as part of pediatric care.<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation19"">19</a>&nbsp;In 2011, the US Surgeon General issued a call to action that clinicians, health systems, community programs, and government policy support women who choose to breastfeed.<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation3"">3</a></p>",https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation6,"<h3><strong>Importance</strong></h3>
<p>There is convincing evidence that breastfeeding provides substantial health benefits for children and adequate evidence that breastfeeding provides moderate health benefits for women. However, nearly half of all mothers in the United States who initially breastfeed stop doing so by 6 months, and there are significant disparities in breastfeeding rates among younger mothers and in disadvantaged communities.<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breastfeeding-primary-care-interventions#citation1"">1</a></p>
<h3><strong>Effectiveness of Interventions to Change Behavior</strong></h3>
<p>Adequate evidence indicates that interventions to support breastfeeding increase the duration and rates of breastfeeding, including exclusive breastfeeding.</p>
<h3><strong>Harms of Interventions to Change Behavior</strong></h3>
<p>There is adequate evidence to bound the potential harms of interventions to support breastfeeding as no greater than small, based on the nature of the intervention, the low likelihood of serious harms, and the available information from studies reporting few harms.</p>

29,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults 18 years and older at increased risk for tuberculosis (see the &ldquo;Assessment of Risk&rdquo; section for more information). It does not apply to adults with symptoms of tuberculosis or to children and adolescents.</p>
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
<p>Populations at increased risk for LTBI based on increased prevalence of active disease and increased risk of exposure include persons who were born in, or are former residents of, countries with increased tuberculosis prevalence and persons who live in, or have lived in, high-risk congregate settings (eg, homeless shelters and correctional facilities). Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about populations at risk in their community, because local demographic patterns may vary across the United States.In 2015, among persons of known national origin, 66.2% of all active tuberculosis cases in the United States were among foreign-born persons, and the case rate of active tuberculosis among foreign-born persons was approximately 13 times higher than among US-born persons (15.1 vs 1.2 cases per 100,000 persons).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation7"">7</a>&nbsp;More than half of all foreign-born persons in the United States with active tuberculosis were from 5 countries: Mexico, the Philippines, Vietnam, India, and China.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation7"">7</a>&nbsp;In addition, the CDC has identified foreign-born persons from Haiti and Guatemala as important contributors to active tuberculosis cases in the United States.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation8"">8</a>&nbsp;The World Health Organization (WHO) recently updated its list of countries with a high burden of tuberculosis to include the top 20 countries with the highest absolute numbers of cases and an additional 10 countries with the most severe burden in terms of case rate per capita.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation9"">9</a>Persons who live in, or have lived in, high-risk congregate settings also have a higher prevalence rate of active tuberculosis and increased risk for exposure. Among persons 15 years and older with active tuberculosis, 5.6% were homeless within the past year, 2.2% were residents of a long-term care facility, and 4.2% were in a correctional facility at the time of diagnosis.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation10"">10</a>&nbsp;Published prevalence rates of LTBI in these settings vary widely, depending on the type of screening test used, the TST threshold used to define the presence of LTBI, and the population studied. Estimates of LTBI prevalence range from 23.1% to 87.6% among prisoners and from 18.6% to 79.8% among persons who are homeless.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation2"">2</a>, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation11"">11</a>Other populations at increased risk for LTBI or progression to active disease include persons who are immunosuppressed (eg, persons living with human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], patients receiving immunosuppressive medications such as chemotherapy or tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors, and patients who have received an organ transplant) and patients with silicosis (a lung disease). However, given that screening in these populations may be considered standard care as part of disease management or indicated prior to the use of certain medications, the USPSTF did not review evidence on screening in these populations. Some evidence from observational studies has explored the association between poorly controlled diabetes and progression of LTBI to active disease. However, there is insufficient evidence on screening for and treatment of LTBI in persons with diabetes for the USPSTF to make a separate recommendation for this important subgroup.Persons who are contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, health care workers, and workers in high-risk congregate settings may also be at increased risk of exposure. Since screening in these populations is conducted as part of public health<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation12"">12</a>&nbsp;or employee health<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation13"">13</a>, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation14"">14</a>&nbsp;surveillance, the USPSTF did not review the evidence in these populations. Clinicians seeking further information about testing for tuberculosis in these populations can refer to the &ldquo;Useful Resources&rdquo; and &ldquo;Recommendations of Others&rdquo; sections.</p>
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
<p>Two types of screening tests for LTBI are currently available in the United States: the TST and IGRA. The TST requires intradermal placement of purified protein derivative and interpretation of response 48 to 72 hours later. The skin test reaction is measured in millimeters of the induration (a palpable, raised, hardened area or swelling). Interferon-gamma release assays require a single venous blood sample and laboratory processing within 8 to 30 hours after collection. Two types of IGRAs are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration: T-SPOT.<em>TB</em> (Oxford Immunotec Global) and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (Qiagen).Numerous patient and systems factors may influence the selection of a screening test.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation15"">15</a> Generally, the CDC recommends screening with either the TST or IGRA but not both. Testing with IGRAs may be preferable for persons who have received a bacille Calmette&ndash;Gu&eacute;rin vaccination or persons who may be unlikely to return for TST interpretation. Additional information on the use and interpretation of the TST and IGRA is available from the CDC.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation16"">16</a></p>
<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found no evidence on the optimal frequency of screening for LTBI. Depending on specific risk factors, screening frequency could range from 1-time only screening among persons who are at low risk for future tuberculosis exposure to annual screening among those who are at continued risk of exposure.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Recommendations for the treatment of LTBI are available from the CDC.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation17"">17</a></p>
<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>
<p>The public health system has an essential role in the control and elimination of tuberculosis. Clinicians are required to report cases of active tuberculosis to their local health department. As outlined by local and state public health laws, local health departments investigate and ensure treatment of active tuberculosis cases and perform contact tracing and medical surveillance of contacts.Occupational health services also have an important role in the prevention and control of tuberculosis. Certain work settings (health care settings, correctional facilities, and other high-risk congregate housing settings) may pose a higher risk of tuberculosis exposure, and employers often have an important role in preventing tuberculosis exposure among employees and performing medical surveillance of employees for exposure.</p>
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
<p>Clinicians seeking guidance on tuberculosis management among persons living with HIV can obtain additional information from the National Institutes of Health.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation18"">18</a>&nbsp;Clinicians seeking information on medical surveillance of contacts of persons with active tuberculosis can contact their local health department, review their local public health law, or review guidance from the CDC.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation19"">19</a>&nbsp;The CDC also provides information for public health tuberculosis programs.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation20"">20</a>Clinicians seeking information on medical surveillance of health care workers or employees working in high-risk settings can consult resources from the CDC and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation21"">21-23</a>&nbsp;Clinicians seeking guidance on screening for LTBI in children can find more information on the American Academy of Pediatrics&rsquo; Bright Futures website.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation24"">24</a>&nbsp;Clinicians seeking guidance on tuberculosis and pregnancy can obtain information from the CDC.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation25"">25</a></p>",,172,"<p></p>
<h3>Other Considerations</h3>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Screening with the TST requires that patients return 48 to 72 hours after administration of the skin test for interpretation of results. When placing a TST, clinicians should plan with patients accordingly to ensure they can return in time and that the facility is able to interpret the test results within the proper time frame.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation26"">26</a> Screening with an IGRA requires obtaining a single venous blood sample, and patients do not need to return for interpretation of results. However, clinicians should be aware of processing requirements for blood samples and ensure that venous blood samples are drawn and can reach the laboratory for processing within the appropriate time frame (8 to 30 hours, depending on the test).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation27"">27</a></p>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
<p>Further research is needed that evaluates risk assessment tools to determine efficient ways of identifying candidates for LTBI testing and treatment. Additional research on how often LTBI screening should be performed in different subpopulations is also needed. The USPSTF identified no studies on LTBI screening or treatment in pregnant women and the potential effects on the fetus; this represents an important gap in the literature that needs further research. In addition, more studies are needed to clarify whether certain screening methods are preferable for certain risk groups.</p>
<h3>Update of USPSTF Recommendations</h3>
<p>The USPSTF last issued a recommendation on screening for tuberculosis in 1996. At that time, the USPSTF recommended screening for tuberculosis infection with the TST in asymptomatic, high-risk persons (A recommendation) and consideration of bacille Calmette&ndash;Gu&eacute;rin vaccination for selected high-risk individuals only (B recommendation). Given the changes in the epidemiology of the disease, the development of newer screening technologies, and newer methods for developing evidence-based recommendations, the USPSTF decided to update the topic and issue a recommendation using its current methodology and considering all of the available evidence, including studies published prior to 1996.</p>
<h3>Recommendations of Others</h3>
<p>The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends screening for LTBI in populations at increased risk.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation34"">34</a> In 2005, the CDC, the American Thoracic Society, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America issued joint guidelines recommending that clinicians screen for LTBI only among high-risk populations and when treatment is feasible.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation35"">35</a> In its 2013 ""Guide for Primary Health Care Providers,"" the CDC recommended targeted testing for tuberculosis among high-risk populations only.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation8"">8</a> The CDC identifies persons at risk for developing tuberculosis as those who have an increased likelihood of exposure to persons with tuberculosis disease (known close contacts of a person with infectious tuberculosis disease, persons who have immigrated from tuberculosis-endemic regions of the world, and persons who work or reside in facilities or institutions with those at high risk for tuberculosis) or persons with clinical conditions or other factors associated with an increased risk of progression from LTBI to tuberculosis disease (HIV infection, injection drug use, radiographic evidence of prior healed tuberculosis, low body weight, or other medical conditions). Further information on targeted testing is available from the CDC.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation36"">36</a>The WHO also recently issued guidelines on the management of LTBI. For high-income countries with an estimated tuberculosis incidence of less than 100 cases per 100,000 persons (such as the United States), the WHO recommends systematic testing for and treatment of LTBI among persons living with HIV, adult and child contacts of persons with pulmonary tuberculosis, patients initiating anti-tumor necrosis factor treatment, patients receiving dialysis, patients preparing for an organ or hematologic transplant, and patients with silicosis. Either an IGRA or the TST should be used. The WHO also recommends considering systematic testing and treatment among prisoners, health care workers, immigrants from high-burden countries, homeless persons, and illicit drug users. Either an IGRA or the TST should be used. It does not recommend systematic testing for LTBI among persons who have diabetes, engage in harmful alcohol use, smoke tobacco, or are underweight, unless they are already included in the above recommendations.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation37"">37</a> Further information is available from the WHO.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation38"">38</a>.</p>",https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation34,"<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>In the United States, tuberculosis remains an important preventable disease, including active tuberculosis, which may be infectious, and latent infection (LTBI), which is asymptomatic and not infectious but can later reactivate and progress to active disease. The precise prevalence rate of LTBI in the United States is difficult to determine; however, based on 2011&ndash;2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data, estimated prevalence is 4.7% to 5.0%.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation1"">1</a> Tuberculosis is spread through respiratory transmission. Approximately 30% of persons exposed to <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </em>will develop LTBI and, if untreated, approximately 5% to 10% of these persons will progress to active tuberculosis disease or reactivation of tuberculosis.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/latent-tuberculosis-infection-screening#citation2"">2-6</a> Rates of progression may be higher in persons with certain risk factors or medical conditions. An effective strategy for reducing the transmission, morbidity, and mortality of active tuberculosis disease is the identification and treatment of LTBI to prevent its progression to active disease. Traditionally, prevention of tuberculosis has relied on public health systems; however, more recently, screening for LTBI has become a relevant primary care issue.</p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that accurate screening tests are available to detect LTBI. Screening tests include the Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs); both are moderately sensitive and highly specific.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment<strong> </strong></h3>
<p>The USPSTF found no studies that evaluated the direct benefits of screening for LTBI. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that treatment of LTBI with regimens recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) decreases progression to active tuberculosis; the magnitude of this benefit is moderate.</p>
<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found no direct evidence on the harms of screening for LTBI. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the magnitude of harms of treatment of LTBI with CDC-recommended regimens is small. The primary harm of treatment is hepatotoxicity.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>

In 2011, about 12% of US adults aged 65 to 74 years and 15% of those 75 years or older reported having problems seeing, even with glasses or contact lenses.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation1"">1</a> The prevalence of AMD is 6.5% in adults older than 40 years and increases with age (2.8% in those aged 40&ndash;59 years and 13.4% in those aged &ge;60 years).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation2"">2</a> About half of all cases of bilateral low vision (ie, best-corrected visual acuity of &lt;20/40) in adults 40 years and older are caused by cataracts. The prevalence of cataracts increases sharply with age; an estimated 50% of US adults 80 years or older have cataracts.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation1"">1</a> The prevalence of hyperopia requiring a correction of +3.0 diopters or more ranges from about 5.9% in US adults aged 50 to 54 years, to 15.2% in adults aged 65 to 69 years, to 20.4% in adults 80 years or older.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation1"">1<br /><br /></a>Older age is an important risk factor for most types of visual impairment. Additional risk factors for cataracts are smoking, alcohol use, ultraviolet light exposure, diabetes, corticosteroid use, and black race. Risk factors for AMD include smoking, family history, and white race.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation1"">1</a>
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
The harms of screening in a primary care setting have not been adequately studied. Overall, the potential for harms from treatment are small to none. Harms of treatment of refractive error include a potential for increased falls with the use of multifocal lenses; infectious keratitis with the use of contact lenses, laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), or laser-assisted subepithelial keratectomy (LASEK); and corneal ectasia with LASIK. Harms of cataract surgery include posterior lens opacification and endophthalmitis. Treatment of AMD with antioxidant vitamins and mineral supplements is not associated with increased risk of most serious adverse events.<br /><br />Although there appears to be benefit in longer-term outcomes, a systematic review found that treatment of AMD with laser photocoagulation was associated with greater risk of acute loss of 6 or more lines of visual acuity vs no treatment at 3 months (relative risk [RR], 1.41 [95% CI, 1.08&ndash;1.82]).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation3"">3</a> Pooled estimates report a non&ndash;statistically significant association bewteen photodynamic therapy and risk of acute loss of 20 or more letters of visual acuity vs placebo at 7 days (RR, 3.75 [95% CI, 0.87&ndash;16]) (3 trials).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation4"">4</a>, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation5"">5</a> One of 2 trials found that treatment of wet AMD with intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor therapy was associated with greater likelihood of withdrawal vs sham therapy; there were no differences in serious or other adverse events, but estimates were imprecise.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation1"">1</a>, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation4"">4</a>, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation6"">6</a>, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation7"">7</a>
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
About half of US adults older than 65 years reported having an eye examination within the last 12 months in a 2007 study.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation8"">8</a>
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
A visual acuity test (eg, the Snellen eye chart) is the usual method for screening for visual acuity impairment in the primary care setting. Screening questions are not as accurate as visual acuity testing for identifying visual acuity impairment. Evidence on the use of other tests for vision screening in primary care, such as the pinhole test (a test for refractive error), the Amsler grid (a test of central vision to detect AMD), genetic testing, or funduscopy (visual inspection of the interior of the eye), is lacking.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
Several types of treatment are effective for improving visual acuity. Corrective lenses improve visual acuity in patients with a refractive error. Treatment of cataracts through surgical removal of the cataract is effective for improving visual acuity. Treatment of exudative (or wet) AMD includes laser photocoagulation, verteporfin, and intravitreal injections of VEGF inhibitors. Antioxidant vitamins and minerals are an effective treatment for dry AMD.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
This recommendation statement does not include screening for glaucoma. The USPSTF&rsquo;s recommendations on screening for glaucoma and falls prevention are available on its website (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).",,165,"The American Optometric Association recommends that asymptomatic adults 61 years and older receive an eye examination every year.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation28"">28</a> The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends a comprehensive eye examination that includes visual acuity testing and dilation every 1 to 2 years for all adults 65 years or older who do not have risk factors or more frequently if risk factors are present.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation29"">29</a> This recommendation is based on descriptive studies, case reports, and expert consensus. The American Academy of Family Physicians&rsquo; recommendation is consistent with that of the USPSTF statement: the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for impaired visual acuity, or vision impairment, in adults 65 years and older who have not reported problems with vision.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation30"">30</a> The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that vision assessment be a part of well-woman visits for all women 65 years or older.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation31"">31</a>",https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/impaired-visual-acuity-in-older-adults-screening#citation28,"<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Impairment of visual acuity is a serious public health problem in older adults. In 2011, about 12% of US adults aged 65 to 74 years and 15% of those 75 years or older reported having problems seeing, even with glasses or contact lenses.</p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening with a visual acuity test can identify persons with a refractive error. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening questions are not as accurate as visual acuity testing for assessing visual acuity. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that visual acuity testing alone does not accurately identify early age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or cataracts.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate overall evidence on the benefits of screening, early detection, and treatment to provide a coherent assessment of the overall benefits. Several studies evaluated the direct benefit of screening and reported no reductions in vision disorders or vision-related function in screened populations; however, these studies had limitations, including differing control interventions, high loss to follow-up, and low uptake of treatment. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that early treatment of refractive error, cataracts, and AMD improves or prevents loss of visual acuity.</p>
<h3>Harms of Detection and Early Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that early treatment of refractive error, cataracts, and AMD may lead to harms that are small to none.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for impaired visual acuity in older adults. The evidence is lacking to provide a coherent assessment, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.</p>",Screening for Impaired Visual Acuity in Older Adults,"Impaired Visual Acuity in Older Adults, Screening, 2016",,,,,
31,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults who do not have a history of premalignant or malignant skin lesions. Patients who present with a suspicious skin lesion or who are already under surveillance because of a high risk of skin cancer, such as those with a familial syndrome (eg, familial atypical mole and melanoma syndrome), are outside the scope of this recommendation statement.</p>
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
<p>Skin cancer of any type occurs more commonly in men than in women and among persons with a fair complexion, persons who use indoor tanning beds, and persons with a history of sunburns or previous skin cancer. Specific risk factors for melanoma include having a dysplastic nevus (atypical mole), having multiple (ie, &ge;100) nevi, and having a family history of melanoma.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation3"">3</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation4"">4</a>&nbsp;Like most types of cancer, the risk of melanoma increases with age; the median age at diagnosis is 63 years, and the median age at death is 69 years.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a></p>
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Benefit of Early Detection and Treatment</h4>
<p>Direct evidence to assess the effect of screening with a clinical visual skin examination on the risk of death from skin cancer is limited.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation3"">3</a>&nbsp;A single ecologic study (Skin Cancer Research to Provide Evidence for Effectiveness of Screening in Northern Germany [SCREEN]) with important methodological limitations suggests that a 1-time, general population-based screening program (with limited participation of 19%) combined with a disease awareness campaign may result in, at most, 1 fewer death due to melanoma per 100,000 persons over a decade.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation5"">5</a>&nbsp;An independent analysis of the SCREEN population found that the observed melanoma mortality rate returned to preintervention levels after 5 years of follow-up (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#fig"">Figure</a>).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation6"">6</a></p>
<h4>Potential Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h4>
<p>Information on the harms of screening is also sparse.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation3"">3</a>&nbsp;The majority of suspicious skin lesions excised during screening are not cancerous; for example, the SCREEN study found that between 20 and 55 excisions were performed to detect 1 case of melanoma, depending on patient age.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation7"">7</a>&nbsp;The SCREEN study did not report the number of excisions required to prevent 1 death from melanoma, but it can be estimated at more than 4,000. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment&mdash;the diagnosis and treatment of cancer that would never have harmed the patient in the absence of screening&mdash;are other important potential harms. Ecologic evidence suggests that screening with a visual skin examination results in the overdiagnosis of skin cancer;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation8"">8</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation9"">9</a>&nbsp;however, current evidence is insufficient to be reliably certain of the magnitude of this effect.</p>
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
<p>Contemporary data on clinician practice patterns related to skin cancer screening are limited. A 2005 survey of US physicians found that 81% of dermatologists, 60% of primary care physicians, and 56% of internists reported performing a full-body visual skin cancer screening examination on their adult patients.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation10"">10</a></p>
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
<p>The clinical visual skin examination assesses skin lesions using the &ldquo;ABCDE rule,&rdquo; which involves looking for the following characteristics: asymmetry, border irregularity, nonuniform color, diameter greater than 6 mm, and evolving over time.</p>
<h3>Screening Interval</h3>
<p>The optimal interval for visual skin examination by a clinician to screen for skin cancer, if it exists, is unknown.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Treatment of screen-detected melanoma generally involves excision, with or without lymph node management, depending on the stage at diagnosis. There are a variety of treatments available for squamous and basal cell carcinoma (which have excellent cure rates), including surgical excision, Mohs micrographic surgery, radiation therapy, curettage and electrodessication, and cryosurgery, among other options.</p>
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
<p>The USPSTF recommends that children, adolescents, and young adults aged 10 to 24 years who have fair skin be counseled about minimizing their exposure to ultraviolet radiation to reduce their risk of developing skin cancer.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation11"">11</a></p>
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force has made a number of recommendations related to preventing skin cancer through the use of interventions that target child care centers; outdoor occupational, recreational, and tourism settings; primary and middle schools; and communities (available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.thecommunityguide.org/cancer/index.html"" target=""_blank"">www.thecommunityguide.org/cancer/index.html</a><a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/exit-disclaimer"" title=""This link goes offsite.

<p>The USPSTF recognizes the challenge of conducting a definitive randomized clinical trial (RCT) on primary screening, with cause-specific mortality as an end point, to provide clear evidence on the efficacy of the clinical visual skin examination in screening for skin cancer, given the comparatively low rate of death from melanoma in the population (even among persons at higher risk). If adequately powered RCTs are not possible, a&nbsp;high-quality case-control study could provide sufficient power without requiring a large sample size. However,&nbsp;this study design has limitations in the ability to create an appropriate comparison group, the ability to accurately measure the exposure of interest (because of recall bias and other sources of misclassification), healthy volunteer bias (persons receiving skin examinations likely have other good health habits), and other unmeasured sources of confounding. Studies would have to be carefully designed to avoid these threats to validity. Despite these challenges, the USPSTF concludes that further evidence is necessary to advance the field on this essential question. An optimized version of the SCREEN study (ie, a time-series study), in which the clinical visual skin examination alone, without the potential confounding of a second intervention, is evaluated, would also be useful. Additional research on the possible harms of screening for skin cancer&mdash;particularly the potential for overdiagnosis and overtreatment&mdash;is also needed to help fully understand the ultimate net benefit of the clinical visual skin examination.</p>
<h3>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendations</h3>
<p>This recommendation updates the 2009 USPSTF recommendation.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation18"">18</a>&nbsp;The USPSTF has again concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefit and harms of screening for skin cancer in adults with a clinical visual skin examination. However, the USPSTF decided to no longer include a statement about patient skin self-examination in the current recommendation. This intervention will be addressed in the USPSTF&rsquo;s update of its recommendation statement on counseling to prevent skin cancer.</p>
<h3>Recommendations of Others</h3>
<p>Most professional organizations in the United States have no specific recommendations about screening for skin cancer with the clinical visual skin examination. The American College of Physicians has no current guidance on skin cancer screening performed by a clinician, nor does the American College of Preventive Medicine (the latter has an archived statement from 1998<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation19"">19</a>). The American Academy of Family Physicians concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefit and harms of visual skin cancer screening in adults.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation20"">20</a>&nbsp;The American Academy of Dermatology does not have formal guidelines on skin cancer screening, although it does encourage and provide resources for its physician members to hold free skin cancer screening events for the public.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation21"">21</a>&nbsp;The American Cancer Society recommends that adults 20 years and older who receive periodic health examinations should have their skin examined as part of a general cancer-related checkup.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation22"">22</a></p>",https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation18,"<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Skin cancer includes melanoma and basal and squamous cell carcinoma. Basal and squamous cell carcinoma, known together as nonmelanoma skin cancer, are the most common types of cancer in the United States and represent the vast majority of all cases of skin cancer (&gt;98%).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;However, nonmelanoma skin cancer rarely results in death or substantial morbidity (&lt;0.1% of patient deaths are caused by this type of cancer), whereas melanoma skin cancer has notably higher mortality rates.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;For this reason, although a visual skin examination by a clinician will detect all 3 of these cancer types, in understanding the potential benefit of screening, the USPSTF prioritized outcomes related to melanoma in developing this recommendation statement. In 2016, an estimated 76,400 US men and women will develop melanoma and 10,100 will die from the disease.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a></p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>Evidence is adequate that visual skin examination by a clinician has modest sensitivity and specificity for detecting melanoma. Evidence is more limited and inconsistent regarding the accuracy of the clinical visual skin examination for detecting nonmelanoma skin cancer.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/skin-cancer-screening2#citation2"">2</a></p>
<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>
<p>Evidence is inadequate to reliably conclude that early detection of skin cancer through visual skin examination by a clinician reduces morbidity or mortality.</p>
<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>
<p>Evidence is adequate that visual skin examination by a clinician to screen for skin cancer leads to harms that are at least small, but current data are insufficient to precisely bound the upper magnitude of these harms. Potential harms of skin cancer screening include misdiagnosis, overdiagnosis, and the resulting cosmetic and&mdash;more rarely&mdash;functional adverse effects resulting from biopsy and overtreatment.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">Pulse palpation and heart auscultation can also detect atrial fibrillation.

Treatment of atrial fibrillation includes anticoagulant therapy for stroke prevention, which is associated with a risk of bleeding, and pharmacologic, surgical, endovascular (eg, ablation), or combined treatments to control heart rhythm or heart rate. In addition, ECG may detect other abnormalities (either true- or false-positive results) that can lead to invasive confirmatory testing and treatments that have the potential for serious harm. For example, angiography and revascularization are associated with risks, including bleeding, contrast-induced nephropathy, and allergic reactions to the contrast agent.</p>

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">Treatment of atrial fibrillation has 2 components&mdash;managing arrhythmia and preventing stroke. In general, these treatment goals are independent of each other, because even restoring sinus rhythm does not necessarily reduce stroke risk enough to change how anticoagulant therapy is managed, given the potential for subsequent recurrence of atrial fibrillation. Arrhythmia can be managed by controlling the heart rate to minimize symptoms (usually through medication) or by restoring a normal rhythm. Methods for restoring normal rhythm include electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion and surgical or catheter ablation. Some evidence suggests that selected patients may be able to reverse atrial fibrillation through lifestyle changes that address the underlying causes of atrial fibrillation.<sup style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;""><a style=""padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.1em; margin: 0em; color: #0072bc; text-decoration-line: none;"" href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/atrial-fibrillation-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation8"">8</a></sup>&nbsp;Stroke risk for persons with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation can be estimated with tools such as CHADS<sub style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;"">2</sub>&nbsp;(congestive heart failure, hypertension, age &ge;75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism [doubled]) (developed by Gage and colleagues, Washington University School of Medicine) or its updated version, CHA<sub style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;"">2</sub>DS<sub style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;"">2</sub>-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age &ge;75 years [doubled], diabetes, stroke/transient ischemic attack/thromboembolism [doubled], vascular disease [prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque], age 65-74 years, sex category [female]) (Lip and colleagues, University of Birmingham Centre for Cardiovascular Sciences).

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">The connection between atrial fibrillation and stroke is well established, as is the existence of undiagnosed atrial fibrillation, especially among older adults. Randomized trials enrolling asymptomatic persons that directly compare screening with usual care and that assess both health outcomes and harms are needed to understand the balance of benefits and harms of screening for atrial fibrillation. Other research needs include understanding how to best optimize the accuracy of ECG interpretation. Although the evidence review for this recommendation statement focused on screening with ECG, the effectiveness of newer technologies capable of assessing pulse and heart rhythm as potential screening strategies should be evaluated. In addition, as ECG and other technologies (eg, AliveCOR Kardia system [AliveCor Inc], discussed in the context of the REHEARSE-AF trial below) are used to record heart activity for longer periods and thus are able to detect shorter episodes of arrhythmia, understanding the stroke risk associated with brief episodes of subclinical atrial fibrillation, and the potential benefit of anticoagulation therapy if risk is significant, is another important research need.</p>

33,"<p><strong>Patient Population Under Consideration</strong>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic children and adolescents 20 years or younger without a known diagnosis of a lipid disorder.&nbsp;<strong>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</strong><em>&nbsp;</em><em>Potential Preventable Burden</em>Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant disorder caused primarily by mutations in the LDL receptor (<em>LDLR</em>) gene (NCBI Entrez Gene 3949) that causes severe elevations in levels of LDL-C, resulting in early atherosclerotic lesions. Children with familial hypercholesterolemia can have TC and LDL-C levels 2 to 3 times higher than those of unaffected children. Familial hypercholesterolemia is generally asymptomatic in childhood and adolescence and is rarely associated with cardiovascular events in the first 2 decades of life (1). The burden of familial hypercholesterolemia is attributable to premature cardiovascular events in adulthood resulting from long-term exposure to elevated serum cholesterol levels and atherosclerosis.&nbsp;Studies conducted before statin use became common suggest that familial hypercholesterolemia is associated with a cumulative incidence of ischemic heart disease in 1 of 6 men and 1 of 10 women by age 40 years. By age 50 years, 25% of women and 50% of men with untreated familial hypercholesterolemia will experience clinical cardiovascular disease (5). Coronary artery disease occurs in 50% of men by age 50 years and 30% of women by age 60 years (7, 8). Mortality from coronary artery disease is greater in adults younger than 60 years with familial hypercholesterolemia. Among adults surviving to age 60 years, the risk of coronary heart disease approaches that of the general population (1, 9).&nbsp;Multifactorial dyslipidemia is defined by elevated levels of LDL-C (&ge;130 mg/dL) or TC (&ge;200 mg/dL) that are not attributable to familial hypercholesterolemia (2). Several longitudinal studies have documented an association between childhood lipid levels in this range and measures of atherosclerosis in adulthood (1). Studies show that tracking lipid levels from childhood and adolescence to adulthood cannot predict which individuals will have elevated LDL-C or TC as adults (2). In addition, the association between multifactorial dyslipidemia in childhood and adolescence and clinical cardiovascular disease in adulthood is unknown. &nbsp;<em>Potential Harms</em>Most children with elevated lipid levels of a multifactorial origin will not progress to a clinically important lipid disorder or develop premature cardiovascular disease and are therefore subject to overdiagnosis. Screening could result in the labeling of children with a &ldquo;nondisease,&rdquo; parental or child anxiety, or unnecessary or harmful testing and treatment. The adverse effects of long-term use of lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy and lifestyle modification (including diet and physical activity) have not been adequately studied. &nbsp;<em>Current Practice</em>Generally, screening rates for dyslipidemia in children and adolescents seen in primary care have been low. According to the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 2.5% of well-child visits included lipid testing in 1995, and 3.2% included it in 2010 (10). Claims data from health insurance plans report rare use of lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy in 8- to 20-year-olds. Among more than 13 million children, 665 children initiated lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy between 2005 and 2010, for an overall incidence rate of 2.6 prescriptions per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 0.1 to 2.7) (11).<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Screening Tests</strong>Normal lipid level values for children and adolescents are currently defined by population distributions of lipid levels from the Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study, which was conducted in the 1970s (2, 12). In 1992, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) proposed fixed threshold values to define dyslipidemia in children (TC &ge;200 mg/dL, LDL-C &ge;130 mg/dL, or both). These values are slightly lower than the 95th percentile observed in the Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study for both boys and girls at nearly all ages, although there are some age-related variations in adolescence (2, 13).&nbsp;Cholesterol levels vary by sex and age throughout childhood. Total cholesterol levels increase from birth, stabilize at approximately age 2 years, peak before puberty, and then decline slightly during adolescence (2, 14). The accepted cutoff values for elevated LDL-C and TC may overidentify or underidentify children and adolescents, depending on age and sex (2). Abnormal lipid levels in youth are based on population distributions, not associations with health outcomes. It is unclear to what degree elevated lipid levels in children and adolescents 20 years or younger are associated with future disease risk. &nbsp;Elevated lipid levels track modestly into adulthood, making it difficult to predict which children and adolescents will continue to have elevated cholesterol levels as adults (2, 15, 16). Longitudinal studies suggest that elevated LDL-C levels in adolescence predict elevated LDL-C 15 to 20 years later, with a positive predictive value of 32.9% to 37.3% and lower predictive values among younger children (17).<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Levels of TC may be measured with fasting or nonfasting serum testing . Serum (or plasma) TC and HDL-C levels do not change appreciably according to a fasting or nonfasting state. Serum LDL-C levels may be calculated using the Friedewald formula (LDL-C = TC &minus; [triglycerides/5] &ndash; HDL-C). Because accurate calculation depends on triglyceride levels, serum testing requires a fasting state. Direct measurement of LDL-C does not require fasting and is preferred when triglyceride levels are greater than 400 mg/dL (2). Recent guidelines on screening for dyslipidemia in children recommend measuring either LDL-C or non&ndash;HDL-C levels (18).&nbsp;Screening strategies for dyslipidemia in clinical practice include selective or universal screening. Selective screening is based on family history of dyslipidemia or premature cardiovascular disease. Universal screening is based only on age. Cascade screening is a common screening strategy for familial hypercholesterolemia in other countries. Cascade screening involves case-finding among relatives of patients with confirmed familial hypercholesterolemia and testing for genetic variants identified in the first affected relative (ie, the proband). However, the US health system does not currently have the infrastructure to implement cascade screening (2).&nbsp;There are no universally accepted criteria for the diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia. Studies of children and adolescents with familial hypercholesterolemia use several different diagnostic criteria. All of the criteria use a combination of elevated lipid levels, physical findings, family history, or genetic tests to establish the diagnosis (1).<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Treatment of Dyslipidemia</strong>Interventions for dyslipidemia include lifestyle modification (eg, changes in diet and physical activity) and pharmacotherapy (eg, statins, bile-acid sequestering agents, or cholesterol absorption inhibitors).&nbsp;Statins, or 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, have been widely adopted for use in adults with hypercholesterolemia, because these drugs are effective at reducing cardiovascular events in high-risk adults. As a result of their efficacy in adults, statins are one of the first-line medications considered for use in children and adolescents with hypercholesterolemia (2, 19).&nbsp;The appropriate age at which to start statin use in children with familial hypercholesterolemia is subject to debate. Some experts recommend starting statin use at age 8 or 10 years; others, concerned with adverse effects, recommend initiating use at age 20 years (2). The long-term effects of statin use in children and adolescents are unknown.&nbsp;<strong>Useful Resources</strong> The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen for obesity in children 6 years or older and offer them or refer them to a comprehensive, intensive behavioral intervention (B recommendation) (20). The USPSTF found insufficient evidence on screening for primary hypertension in asymptomatic children and adolescents to prevent subsequent cardiovascular disease in childhood or adulthood (I statement) (21). These recommendations are available on the USPSTF website (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).</p>",,171,"<p><strong>Other Considerations</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Research Needs and Gaps</strong>Randomized trials of screening programs are needed to assess the benefits and harms of combined screening and treatment programs for familial hypercholesterolemia in children and adolescents. For both familial hypercholesterolemia and multifactorial dyslipidemia, long-term, controlled treatment trials of lipid-lowering medications, supplements, dietary interventions, or combinations thereof are needed to assess harms, as well as effectiveness to improve intermediate and health outcomes in adulthood (1, 2). These trials should be conducted in racially and ethnically diverse US populations. In the absence of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of screening programs, treatment studies in patients with screen-detected multifactorial dyslipidemia would be informative. In addition, longitudinal studies would help to understand the association between intermediate outcomes in childhood and adolescence and premature myocardial infarction and stroke in adulthood (1, 2). With these studies, it may be possible to consider age- and sex-specific (rather than fixed) cutoff values to define thresholds for abnormal levels of TC and LDL-C (2).&nbsp; There is doubt that long-term RCTs of statin use in children and adolescents with familial hypercholesterolemia can be feasibly and ethically conducted. The feasibility of conducting such trials may increase with use of intermediate outcomes that predict coronary heart disease (2, 22).<strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</strong>&nbsp;This recommendation updates the 2007 USPSTF recommendation on screening for lipid disorders in children, adolescents, and young adults. This recommendation is similar to the previous recommendation in that the evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for lipid disorders in children and adolescents remains insufficient.<strong></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Recommendations of Others</strong>&nbsp; The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&rsquo;s Expert Panel on Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents (18) and the American Academy of Pediatrics&rsquo; Bright Futures (31) recommend universal screening before adolescence (ages 9 to 11 years) and again after puberty (ages 17 to 21 years). Selective screening (eg, based on family history and other risk factors) is recommended for younger children starting at age 2 years. The American Academy of Family Physicians (32) states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening for lipid disorders in infants, children, adolescents, or young adults (up to age 20 years). The UK National Screening Committee (33) indicates that there is insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening, although a project is currently under way to evaluate cascade screening.&nbsp;</p>",,"<p><strong>Importance</strong>Dyslipidemia, a genetic or multifactorial disorder of lipoprotein metabolism, is defined by elevations in levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), non&ndash;high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non&ndash;HDL-C), triglycerides, or some combination thereof, as well as lower levels of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C). Elevations in levels of TC, LDL-C, and non&ndash;HDL-C are associated with risk of cardiovascular disease in adults, as are lower levels of HDL-C and, to a lesser extent, elevated triglyceride levels. &nbsp;<br />Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia occurs in approximately 1 of every 200 to 500 persons in North America and Europe and is more prevalent among populations with known founder effects (up to 1 of 100 persons) (1-3). Familial hypercholesterolemia is variably defined in the literature but generally includes highly elevated LDL-C levels (eg, &ge;190 mg/dL), genetic mutation, or both.&nbsp;Alternatively, dyslipidemia can be a multifactorial disorder, with both polygenic and environmental causes, including obesity. Multifactorial dyslipidemia is defined by elevations in levels of LDL-C (&ge;130 mg/dL [to convert LDL-C values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259]), TC (&ge;200 mg/dL [to convert TC values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259]), or both that are not attributable to familial hypercholesterolemia (4-6). Obesity is associated with slight elevations in LDL-C; it is more strongly related to elevated triglycerides and lower HDL-C. &nbsp;Recent estimates from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicate that 7.8% of children aged 8 to 17 years have elevated levels of TC (&ge;200 mg/dL), and 7.4% of adolescents aged 12 to 19 years have elevated LDL-C (&ge;130 mg/dL) (1, 4, 5).&nbsp;The rationale for screening for lipid disorders in children and adolescents is that early identification and treatment of elevated levels of LDL-C could delay the atherosclerotic process and thereby reduce the incidence of premature ischemic cardiovascular events in adults.&nbsp;<strong>Detection</strong>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the quantitative difference in diagnostic yield between universal and selective screening for familial hypercholesterolemia or multifactorial dyslipidemia.&nbsp;<strong>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</strong>The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence on the benefits of screening for familial hypercholesterolemia or multifactorial dyslipidemia.&nbsp;<em>Familial Hypercholesterolemia</em>The USPSTF found adequate evidence from short-term trials (&le;2 years) that pharmacotherapy interventions result in substantial reductions in levels of LDL-C and TC in children with familial hypercholesterolemia. One short-term pharmacotherapy trial reported a reduction in carotid intima-media thickness. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to address whether treatment with short-term pharmacotherapy leads directly to a reduced incidence of premature cardiovascular disease (eg, myocardial infarction or stroke). The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the association between changes in intermediate lipid outcomes or noninvasive measures of atherosclerosis in children and adolescents and incidence of or mortality from relevant adult health outcomes. &nbsp;<em>Multifactorial Dyslipidemia</em>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits of lifestyle modification or pharmacotherapy interventions in children and adolescents with multifactorial dyslipidemia to improve intermediate lipid outcomes or atherosclerosis markers or to reduce incidence of premature cardiovascular disease. &nbsp;<strong>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</strong>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess the harms of screening for familial hypercholesterolemia or multifactorial dyslipidemia. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess the long-term harms of treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia in children or adolescents. Long-term evidence on the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia was limited to 1 study of statins. Short-term statin use was generally well tolerated in children and adolescents with familial hypercholesterolemia, with transient adverse effects (such as elevated liver enzyme levels). Treatment with bile acid-sequestering agents was commonly associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and poor palatability. The USPSTF also found inadequate evidence to assess the harms of treatment of multifactorial dyslipidemia in children or adolescents. One trial of a low-fat, low-cholesterol dietary intervention in children with multifactorial dyslipidemia showed no harms.&nbsp;<strong>USPSTF Assessment</strong> The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening for lipid disorders in asymptomatic children and adolescents 20 years or younger cannot be determined.</p>",Screening for Lipid Disorders in Children and Adolescents,"Lipid Disorders in Children and Adolescents, Screening, 2016",,,,,
34,"<h3>Risk Factors for CVD</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this recommendation, dyslipidemia is defined as an LDL-C level greater than 130 mg/dL or a high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level less than 40 mg/dL (to convert HDL-C values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259). Most participants enrolled in trials of statin use for the prevention of CVD had an LDL-C level of 130 to 190 mg/dL or a diabetes diagnosis; hypertension and smoking were also common among trial participants.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6""><span style=""font-size: small;"">6</span></a></sup> Persons with an LDL-C level greater than 190 mg/dL were usually excluded from trial participation, as it was not considered appropriate to randomly assign them to placebo. Thus, these recommendations do not pertain to persons with very high cholesterol levels (ie, LDL-C &gt;190 mg/dL) or familial hypercholesterolemia, as they were excluded from most prevention trials.</p>
<p>One trial, JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin), which excluded persons with dyslipidemia or diabetes, evaluated the effect of high-dose rosuvastatin vs placebo in participants with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation10""><span style=""font-size: small;"">10</span></a></sup> The USPSTF previously reviewed the evidence on the utility of CRP as a risk predictor of coronary heart disease and found that although there is an association between elevated CRP levels and coronary heart disease events, there is insufficient evidence that a reduction in CRP levels results in fewer CVD events.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation11""><span style=""font-size: small;"">11</span></a></sup> Additionally, CRP is not currently included in any of the major risk prediction calculators, and the effects of using CRP in addition to traditional CVD risk factors to guide the prescription of statins for reducing CVD risk are uncertain. As such, the USPSTF does not recommend for or against the use of CRP alone as a risk factor in screening to prevent CVD events in asymptomatic adults without a history of CVD.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation12""><span style=""font-size: small;"">12</span></a></sup>&nbsp; In JUPITER, most of the trial participants either also had hypertension (57%) or were smokers (15%)<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation10""><span style=""font-size: small;"">10</span></a></sup>&mdash;risk factors the USPSTF prioritized for determining potential suitability for statin therapy. In the recent HOPE-3 trial, there was no difference in the effects of statins among participants with or without elevated CRP levels.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation8""><span style=""font-size: small;"">8</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>10-Year Risk of CVD Events</h3>
<p>The USPSTF recommends using the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations to calculate 10-year risk of CVD events.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation13""><span style=""font-size: small;"">13</span></a></sup> In 2013, the ACC/AHA released the Pooled Cohort Equations with the publication of new statin therapy guidelines.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup> The calculator derived from these equations takes into account age, sex, race, cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure level, antihypertension treatment, presence of diabetes, and smoking status as risk factors in the prediction model and focuses on hard clinical outcomes (heart attack and death from coronary heart disease; ischemic stroke and stroke-related death) as the outcomes of interest.</p>
<p>This risk calculator has been the source of some controversy, as several investigators not involved with its development have found that it overestimates risk when applied to more contemporary US cohorts, especially those at the lower end of the risk spectrum.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation14""><span style=""font-size: small;"">14</span></a></sup> Although other risk prediction tools are available, they address varying populations, risk factors, and outcomes and have their own limitations. The ACC/AHA risk calculator is, to date, the only US-based CVD risk prediction tool that has published external validation studies in other US-based populations. Other advantages are that it can generate sex- and race-specific risk predictions and that it includes ischemic stroke as an outcome.</p>
<p>Nonmodifiable risk factors for CVD include older age, male sex, and race/ethnicity; however, statin trials have not included persons with only these risk factors. Other risk factors, such as family history of premature coronary artery disease, have not been demonstrated to improve risk prediction in a clinically meaningful way.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation15""><span style=""font-size: small;"">15</span></a></sup></p>
<p>It is important to note that the calculated 10-year CVD event risk derived from the ACC/AHA risk calculator is heavily influenced by age. For example, 41% of men and 27% of women aged 60 to 69 years without a history of CVD will be found to have a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation16""><span style=""font-size: small;"">16</span></a></sup> Many older adults, particularly those aged 65 to 75 years, may meet the recommended risk threshold for treatment with statins in spite of the absence of dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking. No trial data evaluated statin use among persons in this age group without CVD risk factors; thus, the evidence is insufficient to know whether statin use provides them the same or less benefit than in similarly aged adults with CVD risk factors. Decisions about initiating statin use in this age group should be based on shared decision making between clinicians and patients about the potential benefits and harms. Specific recommendations from other organizations for such individuals are discussed in the ""Recommendations of Others"" section.</p>
<p>Periodic assessment of cardiovascular risk factors from ages 40 to 75 years, including measurement of total cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels, is required to implement this recommendation. The optimal intervals for cardiovascular risk assessment are uncertain. Based on other guidelines and expert opinion, reasonable options include annual assessment of blood pressure<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation17""><span style=""font-size: small;"">17</span></a></sup> and smoking status<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation18""><span style=""font-size: small;"">18</span></a></sup> and measurement of lipid levels every 5 years.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup> Shorter intervals may be useful for persons whose risk levels are close to those warranting therapy, and longer intervals are appropriate for persons who are not at increased risk and have repeatedly normal levels.</p>
<h3>Screening and Statin Use in Adults Aged 21 to 39 Years</h3>
<p>The USPSTF systematically searched for evidence on the effect of screening for dyslipidemia in adults aged 21 to 39 years. It found insufficient evidence that screening for dyslipidemia before age 40 years has an effect on either short- or longer-term cardiovascular outcomes.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation19""><span style=""font-size: small;"">19</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation20"">20</a></sup></span> The USPSTF found no studies that evaluated the effects of screening vs no screening, treatment vs no treatment, or delayed vs earlier treatment in adults in this age group. Thus, the USPSTF recommends neither for nor against screening for dyslipidemia in this age group. A separate recommendation statement also found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for dyslipidemia in children and adolescents.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation21""><span style=""font-size: small;"">21</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The USPSTF recognizes the rationale for screening for dyslipidemia in adults aged 20 to 39 years to identify those at risk for the development of early atherosclerosis, including those with familial hypercholesterolemia. Unfortunately, the evidence is lacking in this age group. The USPSTF found 4 trials of statin use for primary prevention that enrolled patients younger than 40 years. However, results were not reported separately for this age group, and it comprised a small part of the overall population.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation19""><span style=""font-size: small;"">19</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation20"">20</a></sup></span> One cohort study compared the effects of statins vs no statins for the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation22""><span style=""font-size: small;"">22</span></a></sup> However, the mean age of patients in this study was 44 years. Given the lack of data on the efficacy of screening for or treatment of dyslipidemia in adults aged 20 to 39 years, the USPSTF encourages clinicians to use their clinical judgment for patients in this age group.</p>
<h3>Statin Use in Adults Aged 40 to 75 Years</h3>
<p>Nineteen RCTs evaluated the effects of statins vs placebo or no statins in adults aged 40 to 75 years without known CVD. Most of the trials, including the recently published HOPE-3 trial,<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation8""><span style=""font-size: small;"">8</span></a></sup> enrolled participants based on an elevated LDL-C level, a diabetes diagnosis, or at least 1 CVD risk factor. Use of low- or moderate-dose statins was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (pooled risk ratio [RR], 0.86 [95% CI, 0.80 to 0.93]), cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.88]), ischemic stroke (RR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.82]), heart attack (RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.57 to 0.71]), and a composite cardiovascular outcome (RR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.63 to 0.78]).<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6""><span style=""font-size: small;"">6</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Among the study populations, the proportion of CVD events prevented (ie, the relative risk reduction) was similar across age, sex, race/ethnicity, lipid level, and other risk factor categories.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6""><span style=""font-size: small;"">6</span></a></sup> Among trials that stratified participants according to a baseline global cardiovascular risk score, similar relative risk estimates were observed among those classified at a higher vs lower CVD event risk.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation10""><span style=""font-size: small;"">10</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation23"">23</a></sup></span></p>
<p>Given similar relative risk reductions, the absolute magnitude of benefit that an intervention with demonstrated efficacy can have in a specific population directly depends on the incidence of disease over time in that population. In other words, the more likely it is that persons in a certain population will have a heart attack or ischemic stroke, the greater the potential reduction in the number of CVD events with statin use will be in that population. This is one of the fundamental reasons for the distinction between a grade B and C recommendation for the population that presents with dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking and a 10% or greater vs 7.5% to 10% 10-year CVD event risk.</p>
<p>In the absence of other risk factors, adults with an LDL-C level greater than 190 mg/dL may still fall below the risk threshold for statin use for CVD prevention. As noted previously, these persons were generally excluded from the prevention trials evaluating the effects of statin use on health outcomes, because expert opinion strongly favors intervention for these individuals. It is possible that the relative risk reduction in this group is higher than in adults with a lower LDL-C level and that the absolute benefit is greater than would be predicted from a risk calculator.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation24""><span style=""font-size: small;"">24</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Dosage</h3>
<p>As previously noted, available RCTs evaluating statins for the prevention of CVD events largely used low and moderate doses. There were no clear differences in estimates of effect when the trials were stratified according to statin dose (refer to the <a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#table"">Table</a> for the drug regimens used in the available trials). The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists meta-analysis showed that greater degree of LDL-C reductions achieved were associated with proportional reductions in major cardiovascular events.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation25""><span style=""font-size: small;"">25</span></a></sup> However, these analyses were based not on randomized comparisons but the degree of LDL-C reduction achieved. The degree of cholesterol reduction may be attributable, in part, to interindividual variability in response to statins, not just statin dosage.</p>
<p>Limited information is available about use of high-dose statins in a primary prevention population. As such, the harms of statin use for the prevention of CVD events in adults aged 40 to 75 years can only be bounded as small for low- or moderate-dose statins. There may be individual clinical circumstances that warrant consideration of high-dose statin use; decisions about dose should be based on shared decision making between patients and clinicians. However, the most directly applicable body of evidence for patients without a history of CVD demonstrates benefits with use of low- to moderate-dose statins.</p>
<p>Available information about use of high-dose statins in a prevention population comes from the JUPITER trial. The trial found an increased risk of physician-reported incident diabetes with statin use compared with placebo after 2 years of follow-up (3.2% vs 2.4%; RR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.05 to 1.49]), which was not reported in trials evaluating use of moderate- or low-dose statins.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation10""><span style=""font-size: small;"">10</span></a></sup> Post hoc analysis subsequently suggested that many of the diabetes cases in JUPITER may have occurred in participants who had other risk factors for diabetes at baseline (eg, impaired fasting blood glucose or obesity).<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation26""><span style=""font-size: small;"">26</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The incidence of CVD events in a population increases linearly with CVD risk level; there is no threshold at which event rates abruptly escalate. As such, any cut point for assessing where the net benefit of statin use shifts from small to moderate for a population requires judgment. Evidence indicates that currently available risk calculators tend to overestimate CVD risk, suggesting that actual benefits may be lower than estimated. Issues to consider include the uncertainty of current risk prediction methods, the overall probability of CVD events occurring in the population, the known and unknown associated harms of statin use, and patient preferences.</p>
<p>The USPSTF concludes that adults who smoke or have dyslipidemia, diabetes, or hypertension and a 10% or greater 10-year CVD event risk should be offered a low- to moderate-dose statin. Adults with diabetes or dyslipidemia and a 20% or greater 10-year CVD event risk are most likely to benefit from statin use.</p>
<p>Clinicians may selectively offer adults who smoke or have dyslipidemia, diabetes, or hypertension and a 7.5% to 10% 10-year CVD event risk a low- to moderate-dose statin. Fewer persons in this population will benefit from the intervention, so the decision to initiate use of low- to moderate-dose statins should reflect shared decision making that weighs the potential benefits and harms, the uncertainty about risk prediction, and individual patient preferences, including the acceptability of long-term use of daily medication.</p>
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement for Initiating Statin Therapy for Primary Prevention in Adults 76 Years and Older</h3>
<h4><strong><em>Potential Preventable Burden</em></strong></h4>
<p>Adults 76 years and older were not included in any of the randomized trials of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6""><span style=""font-size: small;"">6</span></a></sup> Thus, understanding of the potential benefits of initiating statin use for primary prevention in this age group is limited.</p>
<h4><strong><em>Potential Harms</em></strong></h4>
<p>Evidence on the potential harms of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults 76 years and older is very limited. Observational evidence suggests there may be an association between very low cholesterol levels and an increased risk of mortality with advanced age, after adjusting for other risk factors.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation27""><span style=""font-size: small;"">27</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation28"">28</a></sup></span></p>
<h4><strong><em>Current Practice</em></strong></h4>
<p>The most current data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey indicate that nearly half (47.6%) of adults 75 years and older in the United States use prescription cholesterol-lowering medications. The majority (&gt;80%) use a statin alone.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation29""><span style=""font-size: small;"">29</span></a></sup> The survey did not distinguish between the use of cholesterol-lowering medications for the purposes of primary vs secondary prevention, so it is not possible to determine how many of these persons have had a previous heart attack or ischemic stroke. Another study using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which did allow for the differentiation of individuals with and without vascular disease (defined as coronary heart disease, stroke, or peripheral vascular disease), found that the rate of statin use among adults 80 years and older for the purposes of primary prevention increased from about 9% in 1999&ndash;2000 to 34% in 2011&ndash;2012.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation30""><span style=""font-size: small;"">30</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, as part of the Choosing Wisely campaign, highlighted the use of cholesterol-lowering medications in adults with limited life expectancy (ie, 70 years and, most particularly, 85 years and older) among its ""10 Things Physicians and Patients Should Question"" because of the increased likelihood of an overall unfavorable risk-to-benefit ratio.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation31""><span style=""font-size: small;"">31</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
<p>The USPSTF has made other recommendations relevant to the prevention of CVD in adults, including aspirin use for the prevention of CVD,<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation32""><span style=""font-size: small;"">32</span></a></sup> screening for coronary heart disease using electrocardiography,<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation33""><span style=""font-size: small;"">33</span></a></sup> use of nontraditional risk factors in CVD risk assessment,<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation12""><span style=""font-size: small;"">12</span></a></sup> screening for high blood pressure,<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation17""><span style=""font-size: small;"">17</span></a></sup> screening for abnormal blood glucose levels and type 2 diabetes mellitus,<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation34""><span style=""font-size: small;"">34</span></a></sup> interventions for tobacco smoking cessation,<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation18""><span style=""font-size: small;"">18</span></a></sup> behavioral counseling to promote a healthful diet and physical activity for CVD prevention in adults,<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation36""><span style=""font-size: small;"">36</span></a></sup> and screening for and management of obesity in adults.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation36""><span style=""font-size: small;"">36</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
<p>Given the lack of studies on screening for and treatment of dyslipidemia in adults aged 20 to 39 years, more research is needed to examine the efficacy of screening and treatment in this age group. More research is needed to address the efficacy and safety of long-term statin use in this population and to determine effects of earlier vs delayed initiation of statin use, particularly in persons with highly elevated lipid levels (eg, persons with familial hypercholesterolemia). Additional research is needed to further clarify the true predictive accuracy of the Pooled Cohort Equations to predict cardiovascular risk in more contemporary and diverse populations to optimally guide clinical risk assessment. Research is needed to evaluate the optimal frequency of cardiovascular risk assessment, including serum lipid screening. There are limited data on different statin dosing strategies; trials that directly compare titrated statin therapy to attain target lipid levels vs fixed-dose therapy would be of great value, as would studies that directly compare higher- vs lower-dose statin regimens. Such trials should use hard clinical outcomes as endpoints rather than intermediate markers.</p>
<p>Additional research is also warranted on the potential long-term harms of statin therapy, particularly regarding the possible association with increased incidence of diabetes and cataract surgery. Last, research is needed to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in adults 76 years and older. Currently, there is no trial evidence to evaluate the net benefit of initiating statin therapy in this population.</p>

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">This recommendation replaces the USPSTF 2008 recommendation on screening for lipid disorders in adults. When making a recommendation on a preventive medication, the USPSTF uses the systematic evidence review to determine how to identify persons in the general population for whom the USPSTF can be moderately certain about the balance of benefits and harms of a preventive medication on health outcomes.</p>
<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">Accumulating evidence on the role of statins in preventing CVD events across different populations led the USPSTF to reframe its main clinical question &nbsp;from ""which population should be screened for dyslipidemia?"" to ""which population should be prescribed statin therapy?"" Screening for elevated lipid levels is a necessary (but not sufficient) step in the overall assessment of CVD risk to help identify persons who may benefit from statin therapy. In the age range in which statins have been studied for primary prevention, universal screening for elevated lipid levels is required to make this determination. Therefore, the screening framework used in the previous USPSTF recommendation statement is no longer relevant and has been replaced by a preventive medication framework. This recommendation statement focuses on the assessment of overall CVD risk to identify adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who will benefit most from statin use to reduce their risk of experiencing a CVD event. The USPSTF found no studies that evaluated the effects of statin use on health outcomes in disease-free adults younger than 40 years. The research plan that guided the evidence review, which served as the foundation of this recommendation statement, did not consider reduction in LDL-C level to be a sufficient surrogate for health outcomes.</p>

Instead of treating to a specific LDL-C target, the ACC and AHA recommend fixed-dose statin therapy using either a high-intensity regimen (daily dose reduces LDL-C level by approximately &ge;50%) or a moderate-intensity regimen (daily dose reduces LDL-C level by approximately 30% to &lt;50%).<sup style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;""><a style=""padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.1em; margin: 0em; color: #0072bc; text-decoration: none;"" href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation24"">24</a></sup>&nbsp;In response, the Mayo Clinic established a task force, which generally provides consistent recommendations, although it emphasizes lifestyle modifications rather than statin therapy in adults 40 years and older who have an LDL-C level less than 100 mg/dL or are sufficiently motivated to reduce their CVD event risk to less than 7.5%.<sup style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;""><a style=""padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.1em; margin: 0em; color: #0072bc; text-decoration: none;"" href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation43"">43</a></sup></p>

<p>Cardiovascular disease is a broad term that encompasses a number of atherosclerotic conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, including coronary heart disease, as ultimately manifested by myocardial infarction (MI), and cerebrovascular disease, as ultimately manifested by stroke. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, accounting for 1 of every 3 deaths among adults.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation5""><span style=""font-size: small;"">5</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Statins are a class of lipid-lowering medications that function by inhibiting the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase, which is involved in the rate-limiting step in the production of cholesterol. Statins reduce levels of total cholesterol and LDL-C and, to a lesser extent, triglycerides, and probably have anti-inflammatory and plaque stabilization effects as well.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation6""><span style=""font-size: small;"">6</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Potential Benefits of Statin Use</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that use of low- to moderate-dose statins reduces the probability of CVD events (MI or ischemic stroke) and mortality by at least a moderate amount in adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater.</p>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that use of low- to moderate-dose statins reduces the probability of &nbsp;CVD events and mortality by at least a small amount in adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 7.5% to 10%.</p>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to conclude whether initiating statin use in adults 76 years and older who are not already taking a statin is beneficial in reducing the incidence of CVD events and mortality.</p>
<h3>Potential Harms of Statin Use</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of low- to moderate-dose statin use in adults aged 40 to 75 years are small. Randomized, clinical trials (RCTs) of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events have largely used low and moderate doses; under these conditions, statin use was not associated with serious adverse events such as cancer, severely elevated liver enzyme levels, or severe muscle-related harms. However, evidence concerning the association between statin use and diabetes mellitus is mixed, with 1 prevention trial suggesting that there may be a small increased risk of developing diabetes with use of high-dose statins. Myalgia is a commonly reported adverse effect of statins, but placebo-controlled trial data do not support the conclusion that statin use has a major causative role in its occurrence. Evidence for cognitive harms is relatively sparse; further research would be needed to more definitively establish the relationship between statin use and cognitive function. The USPSTF found no clear evidence of decreased cognitive function associated with statin use. These findings are consistent with those from a recent systematic review of RCTs and observational studies assessing the effect of statins on cognition that found no effect on incidence of Alzheimer disease or dementia.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation7""><span style=""font-size: small;"">7</span></a></sup> The recently published HOPE-3 (Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation 3) trial found that statin use increased risk of cataract surgery, which was unanticipated and not a predetermined outcome of the trial.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation8""><span style=""font-size: small;"">8</span></a></sup> None of the other primary prevention trials reported this outcome.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/statin-use-in-adults-preventive-medication1#citation9""><span style=""font-size: small;"">9</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of statin use for the prevention of CVD events in adults 76 years and older without a history of heart attack or stroke.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that initiating use of low- to moderate-dose statins for the prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater has at least a moderate net benefit.</p>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that initiating use of low- to moderate-dose statins for the prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 7.5% to 10% has a small net benefit. The decision to initiate therapy in this population should reflect an assessment of patients&rsquo; specific circumstances and their preference for a potential small benefit relative to the potential harms and inconvenience of taking a lifelong daily medication.</p>

These more intensive interventions ranged in duration from 4 weeks to 6 years, with the active intervention period often lasting for 6 months. Interventions were delivered by primary care clinicians, health educators, behavioral health specialists, nutritionists or dieticians, exercise specialists, and lay coaches. Behavioral change techniques included goal setting and planning, monitoring and feedback, motivational interviewing, addressing barriers to change, increasing social support, and general education and advice.

Harms of testing for CAC score include exposure to radiation and incidental findings on computed tomography of the chest, such as pulmonary nodules, that may lead to further invasive testing and procedures. Abnormal test results may lead to further testing, procedures, and lifelong medication use without proof of benefit but with expense and potential adverse effects for the patient.

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">Accurate identification of persons at high risk for CVD events, particularly nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, and CVD death provides the opportunity for more intensive risk factor management to reduce the likelihood of such an event. In addition, identifying persons at low risk may allow for a reduction in interventions with a low benefit to risk ratio for those not likely to benefit.</p>
<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">Several traditional risk factors are associated with higher risk for CVD events, including older age, male sex, high blood pressure, current smoking, abnormal cholesterol levels, diabetes, obesity, and physical inactivity. Risk factors can be combined in many ways to classify a person&rsquo;s risk for a CVD event as low, intermediate, or high. Several calculators and models are available to quantify a person&rsquo;s 10-year CVD event risk. The Framingham Risk Score (which estimates a person&rsquo;s 10-year risk of coronary heart disease) was 1 of the first widely used risk assessment tools. Persons with a 10-year CVD event risk greater than 20% are generally considered at high risk, those with a 10-year risk less than 10% are considered at low risk, and those in the 10% to 20% range are considered at intermediate risk. The Pooled Cohort Equations (which estimate 10-year risk of myocardial infarction, death from coronary heart disease, or stroke) were introduced in 2013 and were developed using more contemporary and diverse cohort data, with the inclusion of race/ethnicity and diabetes. Persons with a 10-year CVD event risk less than 7.5% are considered at low risk, and those with a 10-year risk of 7.5% or greater are considered at high risk.<sup style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;""><a style=""padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.1em; margin: 0em; color: #0072bc; text-decoration-line: none;"" href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation4"">4</a></sup>&nbsp;The distribution of estimated CVD risk in the US population is highly influenced by age and sex. Population estimates of the distribution of 10-year CVD event risk assessed by the Pooled Cohort Equations, which categorize risk using somewhat different thresholds, and using 2001-2010 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey show that the vast majority of US adults aged 40 to 49 years have an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7% or less (93% of women and 81% of men). Among US adults aged 50 to 59 years, 80% of women and 46% of men have an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7% or less; 42% of women and 7% of men aged 60 to 69 years have an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7% or less.<sup style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;""><a style=""padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.1em; margin: 0em; color: #0072bc; text-decoration-line: none;"" href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-screening-using-nontraditional-risk-assessment#citation5"">5</a></sup></p>

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">A substantial number of studies demonstrate an association between the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score and cardiovascular outcomes, so additional association studies are unlikely to add more information. Similarly, studies assessing nontraditional risk factors in isolation are of limited value, given that current treatment recommendations are based on risk assessment with the Framingham Risk Score or Pooled Cohort Equations. Good-quality studies comparing traditional risk assessment with traditional risk assessment plus the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC scores are needed to measure the effect of adding nontraditional risk factors on clinical decision thresholds and patient outcomes (CVD events and mortality). Studies are especially needed in more diverse populations (women, racial/ethnic minorities, persons of lower socioeconomic status), in whom assessment of nontraditional risk factors may help address the shortcomings of traditional risk models. In addition, well-designed prospective studies reflective of real-world practice are needed to identify the downstream effects of CAC score on additional testing and procedures.</p>

Unlike other infections for which screening is recommended, HSV infection may not have a long asymptomatic period during which screening, early identification, and treatment may alter its course. Antiviral medications may provide symptomatic relief from outbreaks; however, these medications do not cure HSV infection. Although vertical transmission of HSV can occur between an infected pregnant woman and her infant during vaginal delivery, interventions can help reduce transmission. Neonatal herpes infection, while uncommon, can result in substantial morbidity and mortality.</p>

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">In the past, most cases of genital herpes in the United States have been caused by infection with HSV-2. Adequate evidence suggests that the most widely used, currently available serologic screening test for HSV-2 approved by the US Food and Drug Administration is not suitable for population-based screening, based on its low specificity, the lack of widely available confirmatory testing, and its high false-positive rate. Rates of genital herpes due to HSV-1 infection in the United States may be increasing.

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">The USPSTF has identified several research gaps. More research on the complex pathophysiology of preeclampsia is needed to better understand and define its subtypes and their risks to maternal and perinatal health. Once preeclampsia is more clearly defined, screening tools targeting its various subtypes and different study populations may be necessary. Descriptive studies that characterize variations in current preeclampsia screening practices in various types of health care settings would be helpful for identifying alternative screening approaches to evaluate in clinical studies. Research examining screening algorithms and new markers for screening are needed. Studies are needed to further develop and validate tools for risk prediction using rigorous methodology, including appropriate calibration statistics and validated models that use parameters available in routine care (eg, clinical history and clinical testing). Large studies are needed to compare different approaches to screening and effects on maternal and perinatal health outcomes, as well as long-term health outcomes.</p>

A decrease in physical activity in young children is a risk factor for obesity later in adolescence. Obesity rates continue to increase in some racial/ethnic minority populations.

Intensive interventions involving 52 or more contact hours rarely took place in primary care settings but rather in settings to which primary care clinicians could refer patients.

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">Metformin has been used for weight loss in children but is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. Metformin has a small effect on weight (BMI reduction &lt;1), and this effect is of uncertain clinical significance. Although the harms of metformin use are probably small, evidence regarding long-term outcomes of its use is lacking. In addition, participants in the metformin trials had abnormal insulin or glucose metabolism, and most had severe obesity. This limits the applicability of the results to a general pediatric population with obesity. Orlistat is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in adolescents 12 years and older. However, orlistat also has a small effect on weight (BMI reduction &lt;1), and this effect is of uncertain clinical significance. In addition, orlistat is associated with moderate harms. Therefore, the USPSTF encourages clinicians to promote behavioral interventions as the primary effective intervention for weight loss in children and adolescents.</p>

Trials evaluating the direct benefit and harms of screening for obesity in children and adolescents are needed. One such trial could implement a systematic screening and treatment program in 1 set of clinics and providers and continue with usual care in a separate set of clinics and providers. Reproducing existing effective interventions and conducting full trials of small feasibility studies are necessary next steps. Further investigations to determine the specific effective components of behavioral interventions are needed. Long-term follow-up of participants after completion of treatment is needed to confirm maintenance of weight loss and to assess long-term benefits and harms. More studies are needed that address behavioral interventions in diverse populations and younger children (age &le;5 years). Also, more evidence is needed about what constitutes clinically important health benefits and the amount of weight loss associated with those health benefits. The quality of study methods and reporting in recent studies is much better than in the earlier literature; however, the field would benefit further from improved consistency in how health outcomes are reported. Individual-patient meta-analysis could be beneficial in helping understand the differences between patients who lose weight and those who do not. Efficacy and safety trials of weight loss medications for pediatric populations with obesity are needed</p>

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">Numerous gynecologic conditions may be detected during a screening pelvic examination. These include malignant diseases, such as ovarian, uterine, vaginal, and cervical cancer; infectious diseases, such as bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis, genital warts, genital herpes, trichomoniasis, and pelvic inflammatory disease; and other benign conditions, such as cervical polyps, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, dysfunction of the pelvic wall and floor, and uterine fibroids.</p>
<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">The accuracy of detecting and the benefit of treating some of these conditions early, while women are asymptomatic, is unknown. No studies evaluated the effectiveness of early diagnosis and treatment of screen-detected, asymptomatic gynecologic conditions compared with the diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic gynecologic conditions.<sup style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;""><a style=""padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.1em; margin: 0em; color: #0072bc; text-decoration: none;"" href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4"">4</a></sup>&nbsp;It is also unknown whether performing screening pelvic examinations more frequently than every 3 to 5 years (the recommended screening interval for cervical cancer) is beneficial. Although it is common practice to perform a pelvic examination as part of an annual physical examination, the benefit of performing screening pelvic examinations at this interval is unclear. The benefit of using pelvic examination alone to screen for gynecologic conditions other than cervical cancer, gonorrhea, and chlamydia is also unknown.</p>
<h4 style=""padding: 1em 0em 0em; margin: 0em; font-size: 12px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Potential Harms</h4>
<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">The USPSTF found limited evidence on the harms of screening with pelvic examination. Harms reported in studies included false-positive and false-negative results.

In particular, there is a concern for potential invasive diagnostic procedures and treatment of ovarian cancer (such as surgery) that could result from evaluating abnormal findings on pelvic examination. In the reviewed studies, approximately 5% to 36% of women who had abnormal pelvic examination findings went on to have surgery.<sup style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;""><a style=""padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.1em; margin: 0em; color: #0072bc; text-decoration: none;"" href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation4"">4</a></sup>&nbsp;The potential association between urinary tract infections and pelvic examinations was explored in a single study with inconclusive results.<sup style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;""><a style=""padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.1em; margin: 0em; color: #0072bc; text-decoration: none;"" href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/gynecological-conditions-screening-with-the-pelvic-examination#citation6"">6</a></sup>&nbsp;Additional theoretical harms of pelvic examination include psychological harms (anxiety), pain and discomfort from the examination, and the potential for these harms to serve as a barrier for women to receive medical care.</p>
<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">In the absence of clear evidence on the balance of benefits and harms of using pelvic examination to screen for asymptomatic gynecologic conditions, clinicians are encouraged to consider the patient&rsquo;s risk factors for various gynecologic conditions and the patient&rsquo;s values and preferences, and engage in shared decisionmaking with the patient to determine whether to perform a pelvic examination.</p>

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">The USPSTF recognizes that research on the effectiveness of the screening pelvic examination is difficult, given that multiple conditions could potentially be detected with this single preventive service. However, in reviewing the currently available evidence on the benefits and harms of performing screening pelvic examinations in asymptomatic adult women, the USPSTF identified the following critical evidence gaps. Studies evaluating the accuracy and effectiveness of screening pelvic examination to detect conditions other than ovarian cancer, bacterial vaginosis, genital herpes, and trichomoniasis are lacking. Studies reporting on the harms of screening with pelvic examination (including quantified psychological harms) in asymptomatic women in primary care are also lacking.</p>
<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">Studies reporting the effects of performing routine screening pelvic examinations on health outcomes such as all-cause mortality, disease-specific morbidity and mortality, quality of life, and psychological benefits and harms could help fill the gaps in the existing evidence and inform future USPSTF recommendations. Studies evaluating and quantifying harms are needed, as well as studies evaluating the potential effectiveness of risk assessment tools to determine which women might benefit from a pelvic examination. Research is needed to clarify which indications primary care clinicians are currently using the screening pelvic examination for in asymptomatic patients and which components of the pelvic examination are performed most frequently. Studies exploring women&rsquo;s attitudes toward pelvic examinations, the outcomes women value from these examinations, and how pelvic examinations affect women&rsquo;s decisions to seek and obtain care are also needed to clarify the potential benefits and harms of providing this preventive service.</p>

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">Studies that randomly assign participants to screening vs no screening and evaluate clinical outcomes are lacking. However, screening studies that target populations at increased risk for celiac disease are likely to be more informative than trials that target the general population, because of the higher prevalence of disease, and should be given higher priority. More information is needed about the accuracy of serologic testing in asymptomatic persons, particularly those with disease risk factors.</p>
<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">Treatment studies in screen-detected, asymptomatic persons are also needed to understand the effects of adherence to a gluten-free diet (compared with no dietary intervention), as well as the effects of immediate vs delayed dietary changes (ie, at the time of screen-detected diagnosis vs when symptoms develop). Ideally, studies would report both short-term effects on symptoms and quality of life and long-term outcomes (eg, osteoporotic fractures, cancer, and mortality). As for screening, treatment studies focused on asymptomatic persons at high risk for celiac disease who screen positive would be helpful for developing guidance for this population and may be faster and more efficient to complete than other study designs. More research is needed to better understand the natural history of positive serology in patients without histologic changes or with histologic confirmation but no symptoms. Also, treatment studies should report results stratified according to baseline histologic findings, given current uncertainty about the natural history of celiac disease in persons with mild histologic abnormalities.</p>

There is no evidence that women of different races/ethnicities experience a different balance of benefits and harms with menopausal hormone therapy; however, the majority (approximately 80%) of women in the largest trial (WHI) where white, so these analyses may be underpowered to detect such differences. Data regarding whether the timing of initiation of hormone therapy after menopause affects the balance of benefits and harms are conflicting.

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">Menopause is defined as the permanent cessation of a woman&rsquo;s menstrual cycle. It is typically defined in retrospect, 12 months after a woman&rsquo;s final menstrual period. Menopause occurs at a median age of 51.3 years, and the average US woman who reaches menopause is expected to live another 30 years. The prevalence and incidence of most chronic conditions, such as coronary heart disease, dementia, stroke, fractures, and breast cancer, increase with age; however, the excess risk for these conditions that can be attributed to menopause alone is uncertain. Since the publication of findings from the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative (WHI) that hormone therapy use was associated with serious adverse health effects in postmenopausal women, use of menopausal hormone therapy has declined, from 44% of US women using or having used hormone therapy in 1988&ndash;1994 to 4.7% of women in 2010.<sup style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;""><a style=""padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.1em; margin: 0em; color: #0072bc; text-decoration-line: none;"" href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/menopausal-hormone-therapy-preventive-medication1#citation1"">1</a></sup></p>

45,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to children who have not been diagnosed with ASD or developmental delay and for whom no concerns of ASD have been raised by parents, other caregivers, or health care professionals.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
A number of tests are available for screening for ASD in children younger than 30 months. The most commonly studied tool is the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) and its subsequent revisions (Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers With Follow-Up [M-CHAT-F] and Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers&ndash;Revised, With Follow-Up [M-CHAT-R/F]). The M-CHAT-R/F is a parent-rated scale, and a positive finding leads to a follow-up interview. If the follow-up interview is positive, a full diagnostic workup for ASD is indicated. The screening process assesses communication skills, joint attention, repetitive movement, and pretend play.
<h3>Treatments and Interventions</h3>
Treatments for ASD include behavioral, medical, educational, speech/language, and occupational therapy and complementary and alternative medicine approaches. Treatments for young children in the target age group for routine screening for ASD are primarily behavioral interventions, particularly early intensive behavioral and developmental interventions, which may include approaches incorporating applied behavior analysis principles, parent training components, and play- or interaction-based interventions. Among the behavioral interventions, those based on applied behavior analysis have the highest-quality data supporting their effects on cognitive and language outcomes. These interventions can be delivered in a home or school setting and are generally time-intensive, with some programs requiring up to 40 hours a week.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-young-children-screening#citation2"">2</a>
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
Autism spectrum disorder can cause significant social, communication, and behavioral challenges for affected children and place substantial strain on family members and other caregivers. Treatment and maturation may reduce the effects of the core symptoms of ASD for some children, but others may experience long-term effects on education, employment, and ability to live independently.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-young-children-screening#citation2"">2</a>&nbsp;It is important that clinicians listen carefully to parents when concerns are raised by the parents or during an examination and make prompt use of validated tools to assess the need for further diagnostic testing and services. Disparities have been observed in the frequency and age at which ASD is diagnosed among children by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and language of origin, creating concern that certain groups of children with ASD may be systematically underdiagnosed.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-young-children-screening#citation3"">3</a>&nbsp;It is important to note that an ""I"" statement is not a recommendation for or against screening. In the absence of evidence about the balance of benefits and harms, clinicians should use their clinical judgment to decide if screening in children without overt signs and symptoms is appropriate for the population in their care.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
Although there is limited evidence about the harms of screening for ASD in children, reported potential harms include misdiagnosis and the anxiety associated with further testing after a positive screening result, particularly if confirmatory testing is delayed because of resource limitations. Behavioral treatments are not generally thought to be associated with significant harms but can place a large time and financial burden on the family. Other treatments for ASD are less well studied and were not included in this review.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
A 2004 survey of pediatricians in Maryland and Delaware found that 8% screened specifically for ASD. Few data are available regarding the current prevalence of screening for ASD by clinicians in the United States.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-young-children-screening#citation4"">4</a>&nbsp;More recent surveys have found higher rates, although they remain less than 60%.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-young-children-screening#citation5"">5-8</a>

<p>Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disorder characterized by persistent and significant impairments in social interaction and communication and restrictive and repetitive behaviors and activities, when these symptoms cannot be accounted for by another condition. In 2010, the prevalence of ASD in the United States was estimated at 14.7 cases per 1000 children, or 1 in 68 children, with substantial variability in estimates by region, sex, and race/ethnicity.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-young-children-screening#citation1"">1</a></p>
<h3><strong>Detection</strong></h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that currently available screening tests can detect ASD among children aged 18 to 30 months.</p>
<h3><strong>Benefits of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</strong></h3>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence on the benefits of screening for ASD in toddlers and preschool-age children for whom no concerns of ASD have been raised by family members, other caregivers, or health care professionals. There are no studies that focus on the clinical outcomes of children identified with ASD through screening. Although there are studies suggesting treatment benefit in older children identified through family, clinician, or teacher concerns, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the efficacy of treatment of cases of ASD detected through screening or among very young children. Treatment studies were generally very small, few were randomized trials, most included children who were older than would be identified through screening, and all were in clinically referred rather than screen-detected patients.</p>
<h3><strong>Harms of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</strong></h3>
<p>The USPSTF found that the harms of screening for ASD and subsequent interventions are likely to be small based on evidence about the prevalence, accuracy of screening, and likelihood of minimal harms from behavioral interventions.</p>
<h3><strong>USPSTF Assessment</strong></h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes that there is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for ASD in children aged 18 to 30 months for whom no concerns of ASD have been raised.

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">In deciding whether to screen with resting or exercise ECG in asymptomatic adults at intermediate or high risk of CVD events, clinicians should consider the following information.</p>
<h4 style=""padding: 1em 0em 0em; margin: 0em; font-size: 12px; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">Although evidence is insufficient to determine whether screening with ECG in adults is beneficial, those who may be at increased risk of CVD events might have the greatest potential for net benefit. Reclassification into a higher-risk category might lead to more intensive medical management that could lower the risk of CVD events but might also result in harms, including adverse medication effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding and hepatic injury. Regardless of ECG findings, persons who are already at high risk of CVD events should receive intensive risk factor modification. Persons who are classified as low risk are unlikely to benefit from screening with ECG.</p>
<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">For persons in certain occupations, such as pilots and operators of heavy equipment, for whom sudden incapacitation or death may endanger the safety of others, considerations other than the health benefit to the patient may influence the decision to screen with ECG to prevent CVD events.</p>

Two studies of asymptomatic adults with diabetes reported that 6% and 12% of patients who were screened with exercise ECG subsequently underwent angiography, and 3% to 5% underwent revascularization, without evidence of benefit to the study patients.<sup style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;""><a style=""padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.1em; margin: 0em; color: #0072bc; text-decoration-line: none;"" href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-risk-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation1"">1</a></sup><sup style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;"">,&nbsp;</sup><sup style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;""><a style=""padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.1em; margin: 0em; color: #0072bc; text-decoration-line: none;"" href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-risk-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation2"">2</a></sup>&nbsp;Angiography and revascularization are associated with harms, including bleeding, contrast-induced nephropathy, cardiac arrhythmia, stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary artery dissection, allergic reaction to the contrast agent, and death.</p>

A Canadian retrospective cohort study from 2010 to 2015 found that 21.5% of low-risk primary care patients had an ECG within 30 days of an annual health examination, and the proportion of patients who had an ECG ranged across clinics from 1.8% to 76.1%.<sup style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;""><a style=""padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.1em; margin: 0em; color: #0072bc; text-decoration-line: none;"" href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-risk-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation4"">4</a></sup></p>

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">Several factors are associated with an increased risk of CVD events, including older age, male sex, high blood pressure, current smoking, abnormal lipid levels, diabetes, obesity, and physical inactivity. Risk factors are combined in many ways to estimate a person's risk of a CVD event. Several calculators and models are available to quantify a person's 10-year risk of CVD events. The Framingham Risk Score,<sup style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;""><a style=""padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.1em; margin: 0em; color: #0072bc; text-decoration-line: none;"" href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-risk-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation5"">5</a></sup>based on data from the Framingham Heart Study, was one of the first widely used CVD risk assessment tools. Persons with a 10-year CVD event risk greater than 20% are generally considered high risk, those with a 10-year CVD event risk less than 10% are considered low risk, and those with a 10-year CVD event risk of 10% to 20% are considered intermediate risk. The Pooled Cohort Equations, introduced by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association in 2013, include the same variables as the Framingham Risk Score as well as race/ethnicity and diabetes. Persons with a 10-year CVD event risk less than 7.5% are considered at low risk, and those with a 10-year CVD event risk of 7.5% or greater are considered at elevated risk.<sup style=""padding: 0em; margin: 0em;""><a style=""padding: 0em 0.5em 0em 0.1em; margin: 0em; color: #0072bc; text-decoration-line: none;"" href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/cardiovascular-disease-risk-screening-with-electrocardiography#citation6"">6</a></sup>&nbsp;The USPSTF recommends that clinicians use the Pooled Cohort Equations to assess CVD risk.</p>

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">Both resting and exercise ECG are used for the diagnostic evaluation of suspected CVD, which has led to the suggestion that ECG could also be used to screen asymptomatic persons to identify those who would benefit from earlier, more intensive management of modifiable risk factors, preventive interventions, or both. Resting ECG records cardiac electrical activity while the patient is at rest, over a short period of time. Standard ECG testing is performed with 12 leads, although some tests use fewer leads. More recently, ECG leads have been built into blood pressure cuffs, smartphones, and other devices. Exercise ECG records cardiac electrical activity during physical exertion, often at a prespecified intensity level. The most common method of exercise ECG is the treadmill test, but other methods, such as those using bicycles and ergometers, have also been used. Both resting and exercise ECG look for markers of previous myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, and other cardiac abnormalities (such as left ventricular hypertrophy, bundle branch block, or arrhythmia) that may be associated with CVD or predict future CVD events.</p>

Studies are needed that assess the incremental value of adding ECG to current CVD risk assessment tools or instruments to directly inform decision making; studies that examine patient outcomes would be most useful. Failing that, studies are needed that assess the added value of ECG for risk reclassification across clinically relevant risk thresholds. Any study of CVD risk assessment should also evaluate the harms associated with assessment as well as those related to additional testing and treatment. Studies that measure risk reclassification should report total, event, and nonevent Net Reclassification Indices, with corresponding confidence intervals, as well as measures of calibration and discrimination.</p>

<p>This recommendation applies to all pregnant women.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Screening Intervals</b></p>
<p>All pregnant women should be tested for syphilis as early as possible when they first present to care. If a woman has not received prenatal care prior to delivery, she should be tested at the time she presents for delivery. In most cases of congenital syphilis, pregnant women received prenatal care but were not screened and treated for syphilis early enough during the pregnancy to prevent transmission to the fetus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The USPSTF found no new studies that examined the effectiveness of repeated testing for syphilis during pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)5 and joint guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)6 endorse repeat screening. Specifically, these groups recommend that women at high risk for syphilis be rescreened early in the third trimester (at approximately 28 weeks of gestation) and again at delivery. Women at high risk for syphilis infection include those living in communities or geographic areas with higher prevalence of syphilis, those living with HIV, and those with a history of incarceration or commercial sex work.7 AAP and ACOG also recommend repeat screening after exposure to an infected partner.6 Clinicians should be aware of the prevalence of syphilis infection in the communities they serve.7 Most states mandate screening for syphilis in all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit, and some mandate screening at the time of delivery.8</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Screening Tests</b></p>
<p>Syphilis infection is caused by the Treponema pallidum bacteria. Current screening tests for syphilis rely on detection of antibodies to the infection rather than direct detection of the bacteria. Screening for syphilis infection is a 2-step process. Traditionally, screening involved an initial &ldquo;nontreponemal&rdquo; antibody test (ie, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test or rapid plasma reagin [RPR] test) to detect biomarkers released from damage caused by syphilis infection, followed by a confirmatory &ldquo;treponemal&rdquo; antibody detection test (ie, fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption or T pallidum particle agglutination test). Because nontreponemal tests are complex, a reverse sequence screening algorithm has been developed in which an automated treponemal test (such as an enzyme-linked, chemiluminescence, or multiplex flow immunoassay) is performed first, followed by a nontreponemal test. If the test results of the reverse sequence algorithm are discordant, a second treponemal test (preferably using a different treponemal antibody) is performed. The USPSTF found no studies comparing the false-positive rate of the traditional screening algorithm with that of the reverse sequence screening algorithm among pregnant women. The CDC has provided more detailed guidance on testing for and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis.9</p>

<p>In 2015, the CDC recommended parenteral benzathine penicillin G for the treatment of syphilis in pregnant women.5 Evidence on the efficacy or safety of alternative antibiotic medications for pregnant women and the fetus is very limited; therefore, women who report a penicillin allergy should be evaluated and, if found allergic, desensitized and treated with penicillin. Because the CDC updates its recommendations regularly, clinicians are encouraged to consult the CDC website for the most up-to-date information.9</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Additional Approaches to Prevention</b></p>
<p>Trends in congenital syphilis incidence rates are closely related to trends in primary and secondary syphilis infection rates among all women. Screening for syphilis in nonpregnant populations is an important public health approach to preventing the sexual transmission of syphilis and subsequent vertical transmission of congenital syphilis. The USPSTF recommends screening for syphilis in nonpregnant adolescents and adults at increased risk for infection.10</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Useful Resources</b></p>
<p>The USPSTF has made recommendations on screening for other sexually transmitted infections, including chlamydia and gonorrhea,11 hepatitis B virus,12 genital herpes,13 and HIV.14 National-, state-, and county-level data on syphilis infection rates are also available from the CDC.2</p>",,200,"<p><b>Other Considerations: Research Needs and Gaps</b></p>
<p>Although the benefits of screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women to prevent congenital syphilis are well established, additional studies on the use of different screening algorithms in pregnant women, as well as studies to help identify optimal rescreening intervals and populations to rescreen during pregnancy, could help inform implementation of screening programs. Studies on treatment options besides penicillin could also be helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Reaffirmation of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</b></p>
<p>This recommendation is a reaffirmation of the USPSTF 2009 recommendation statement.3 In 2009, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women and found that the benefits of screening substantially outweighed the harms.22 For the current recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a targeted review16 to look for substantial new evidence on the benefits and harms of screening and determined that the net benefit of screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women continues to be well established. The USPSTF found no new substantial evidence that could change its recommendation and, therefore, reaffirms its recommendation to screen for syphilis infection in all pregnant women.</p>
<p><b>Recommendations of Others</b></p>
<p>This recommendation statement is consistent with those of other professional and public health organizations. The CDC recommends screening for syphilis infection in all pregnant women at their first prenatal visit.5 Joint guidelines from AAP and ACOG recommend screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women as early as possible in pregnancy.6 The CDC, AAP, and ACOG also recommend repeat screening at 28 weeks of gestation and again at delivery in high-risk women. Women at high risk for syphilis infection include those living in high-prevalence communities, those living with HIV, and those with a history of incarceration or commercial sex work.10 AAP and ACOG also recommend repeat screening after exposure to an infected partner.6 The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends screening for syphilis infection in all pregnant women.29</p>",,"<p><b>Importance</b></p>
<p>Syphilis is an infection that is primarily sexually transmitted. Untreated syphilis infection in pregnant women can also be transmitted to the fetus (congenital syphilis) at any time during pregnancy or at birth. Congenital syphilis is associated with stillbirth, neonatal death, and significant morbidity in infants (eg, bone deformities and neurologic impairment).1 After a steady decline from 2008 to 2012, cases of congenital syphilis markedly increased from 2012 to 2016, from 8.4 to 15.7 cases per 100,000 live births (an increase of 87%).2 At the same time, national rates of syphilis increased among women of reproductive age.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Reaffirmation</b></p>
<p>In 2009, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women and issued an A recommendation.3 The USPSTF has decided to use a reaffirmation deliberation process to update this recommendation. The USPSTF uses the reaffirmation process for well-established, evidence-based standards of practice in current primary care practice for which only a very high level of evidence would justify a change in the grade of the recommendation.4 In its deliberation of the evidence, the USPSTF considers whether the new evidence is of sufficient strength and quality to change its previous conclusions about the evidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Detection</b></p>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening tests can accurately detect syphilis infection in pregnant women.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Benefits of Detection and Early Treatment</b></p>
<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that early universal screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women reduces the incidence of congenital syphilis and the adverse outcomes of pregnancy associated with maternal infection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Harms of Detection and Early Treatment</b></p>
<p>Screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women may result in potential harms, including false-positive results that require clinical evaluation, anxiety, and harms of treatment with antibiotic medications. However, the USPSTF concluded that these harms of screening are no greater than small.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>USPSTF Assessment</b></p>
<p>Using a reaffirmation process,4 the USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women is substantial.</p>",Screening for Syphilis Infection in Pregnant Women,"Syphilis Infection in Pregnant Women, Screening, 2018",,,,,
49,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women who are not known to have a high-risk hereditary cancer syndrome. A hereditary cancer syndrome occurs when a genetic mutation is passed from parent to child that increases risk for developing cancers or can cause earlier onset of cancers. Women who have a hereditary cancer syndrome that puts them at high risk for ovarian cancer are excluded from this recommendation.</p>
<h3>Risk Assessment</h3>
<p>Women with certain hereditary cancer syndromes are at high risk for ovarian cancer. For example, women with <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> genetic mutations associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer are at high risk for ovarian cancer. Numerous genetic mutations and hereditary cancer syndromes may be associated with ovarian cancer, each with a different constellation of associated cancers and family history pattern.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation3""><span style=""font-size: small;"">3-5</span></a></sup> Women with a family history of ovarian or breast cancer may be at risk for a hereditary cancer syndrome and should discuss their family history with their health care professional. Management of a diagnosed hereditary cancer syndrome and prevention of ovarian cancer in these women is beyond the scope of this recommendation statement.</p>
<p>The clinical symptoms of ovarian cancer (eg, abdominal pain or pressure, bloating, constipation, urinary symptoms, back pain, or fatigue) are nonspecific and may be present in both healthy women and women with late-stage ovarian cancer; therefore, use of clinical symptoms for risk stratification for the early detection of disease is difficult.</p>
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
<p>The USPSTF does not recommend routine screening for ovarian cancer using any method. Transvaginal ultrasound and serum CA-125 testing are readily available procedures that are commonly used to evaluate women with signs or symptoms of ovarian cancer, and both have been evaluated in screening studies. Pelvic examination is also commonly performed to evaluate women with lower abdominal symptoms, and although many clinicians perceive that pelvic examination with bimanual palpation of the ovaries is useful for screening for ovarian cancer,<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation6""><span style=""font-size: small;"">6</span></a></sup> there is a lack of evidence to support this.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation7""><span style=""font-size: small;"">7</span></a></sup> Furthermore, the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial included bimanual palpation of the ovaries in its initial screening protocol, but this screening component was discontinued 5 years into the study because no cases of ovarian cancer were detected solely with bimanual palpation of the ovaries.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation8""><span style=""font-size: small;"">8</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation9"">9</a></sup></span></p>
<p>The evaluation of abnormal test results consists of repeat testing with the same or a different test and often surgical removal (by laparoscopy or laparotomy) of 1 or both of the ovaries and fallopian tubes to determine whether a woman has ovarian cancer. Diagnostic guidelines recommend surgical removal of the complete ovary or ovaries, rather than tissue biopsy, to determine whether ovarian cancer is present.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Treatment of ovarian cancer typically includes surgical treatment (staging or debulking) and intraperitoneal, intravenous, or combined chemotherapy.</p>
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
<p>In a separate recommendation statement, the USPSTF recommends that women with a family history indicating they are at risk for a deleterious gene mutation (<em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em>) be referred for genetic counseling and, if indicated, genetic testing.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation10""><span style=""font-size: small;"">10</span></a></sup> The National Cancer Institute provides additional information on ovarian cancer risk and hereditary cancer syndromes.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation11""><span style=""font-size: small;"">11</span></a></sup> The USPSTF also concluded in a separate recommendation statement that the current evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening with pelvic examination to detect a range of gynecologic conditions in asymptomatic, nonpregnant women.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation7""><span style=""font-size: small;"">7</span></a></sup></p>",,189,"<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
<p>Given that most cases of ovarian cancer are diagnosed at later stages, when associated mortality is high, further research is needed to identify new screening strategies that could accurately detect ovarian cancer early, at a point when outcomes could be improved. There is a need for more sensitive and specific serologic tests, as well as better imaging techniques. Because of the potential for serious harms from diagnostic workup of positive screening results (ie, surgical removal of the ovary to determine whether ovarian cancer is present), new screening strategies should minimize false-positive results and be highly specific. In addition, studies evaluating the benefits and harms of these screening strategies in asymptomatic women not at high risk for ovarian cancer are needed. Study outcomes should include ovarian cancer mortality, quality of life, false-positive rate, surgery rate, surgical complication rate, and psychological harms. Further research is also needed on primary prevention of ovarian cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation of Others</strong></p>
<p>There is consensus among major medical and public health organizations that screening for ovarian cancer in the general population is not recommended. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not recommend screening for ovarian cancer in low-risk, asymptomatic women; evaluation of high-risk women may include transvaginal ultrasound and CA-125 testing, in addition to physical examination.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation22""><span style=""font-size: small;"">22</span></a></sup> The American Cancer Society states that there is no screening test proven to be effective and sufficiently accurate in the early detection of ovarian cancer and does not recommend screening for ovarian cancer in average-risk women.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation23""><span style=""font-size: small;"">23</span></a></sup> The American College of Radiology does not recommend screening for ovarian cancer in average-risk women.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation24""><span style=""font-size: small;"">24</span></a></sup> Consistent with the USPSTF, the American Academy of Family Physicians recommends against screening for ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation25""><span style=""font-size: small;"">25</span></a></sup> Although it is beyond the scope of the USPSTF recommendation, other organizations, such as the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, have issued guidelines for the prevention of ovarian cancer in women with hereditary cancer syndromes.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/ovarian-cancer-screening1#citation26""><span style=""font-size: small;"">26</span></a></sup></p>

<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>The positive predictive value of screening tests for ovarian cancer is low, and most women with a positive screening test result do not have ovarian cancer (ie, many women without ovarian cancer will have a false-positive result on screening tests).</p>
<h3>Benefits of Screening</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening with transvaginal ultrasound, testing for the serum tumor marker cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), or a combination of both does not reduce ovarian cancer mortality.</p>
<h3>Harms of Screening</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for ovarian cancer can result in important harms, including many false-positive results, which can lead to unnecessary surgical interventions in women who do not have cancer. Depending on the type of screening test used, the magnitude of harm ranges from moderate to substantial and reflects the risk for unnecessary diagnostic surgery. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the psychological harms of screening for ovarian cancer.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes that there is at least moderate certainty that the harms of screening for ovarian cancer outweigh the benefits.</p>",Screening for Ovarian Cancer,"Ovarian Cancer, Screening, 2018",,,,,
50,"<p><strong>Patient Population Under Consideration</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation statement applies to all asymptomatic individuals with a cervix, regardless of their sexual history. This recommendation statement does not apply to women who have been diagnosed with a high-grade precancerous cervical lesion or cervical cancer, women with in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol, or women who have a compromised immune system (eg, women living with HIV).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of Risk</strong></p>
<p>High-risk HPV infection is associated with nearly all cases of cervical cancer, and women are exposed to hrHPV through sexual intercourse. Although a large proportion of HPV infections resolve spontaneously, the high likelihood of exposure to hrHPV means that women are at risk for precancerous lesions and cervical cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certain risk factors increase risk for cervical cancer, including HIV infection, a compromised immune system, in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol, and previous treatment of a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer. Women with these risk factors are not included in this recommendation and should receive individualized follow-up. Women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix and do not have a history of a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer are not at risk for cervical cancer and should not be screened. As part of the clinical evaluation, clinicians should confirm through review of surgical records or direct examination that the cervix was removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Screening Tests</strong></p>
<p>Current evidence indicates that there are no clinically important differences between liquid-based cytology and conventional cytology. A variety of platforms are used to detect hrHPV; most use either signal or nucleic acid amplification methods. Published trials of hrHPV testing used in situ hybridization, polymerase chain reaction, and hybrid capture technology to test for HPV strains associated with cervical cancer. hrHPV testing has been used for primary screening, cotesting with cytology, and follow-up testing of positive cytology results (reflex hrHPV).2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Screening with cytology alone, hrHPV testing alone, and both in combination offer a reasonable balance between benefits and harms for women aged 30 to 65 years; women in this age group should discuss with their health care professional which testing strategy is best for them. Evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and decision modeling studies suggest that screening with cytology alone is slightly less sensitive for detecting CIN 2 and CIN 3 than screening with hrHPV testing alone. Although screening with hrHPV testing alone or in combination with cytology detects more cases of CIN 2 and CIN 3, this method results in more diagnostic colposcopies for each case detected.2-5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a number of different protocols for triage of abnormal results from screening with cytology, hrHPV testing, or cotesting. Clinical trial evidence and modeling suggest that different triage protocols have generally similar detection rates for CIN 2 and CIN 3; however, proceeding directly to diagnostic colposcopy without additional triage leads to a much greater number of colposcopies compared with using other triage protocols. Maintaining comparable benefits and harms of screening with cytology alone or hrHPV testing alone requires that patients, clinicians, and health care organizations adhere to currently recommended protocols for repeat testing, diagnostic colposcopy, and treatment.6, 7</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Timing of Screening</strong></p>
<p><strong>Women Younger Than 21 Years</strong></p>
<p>Cervical cancer is rare before age 21 years.8 Exposure of cervical cells to hrHPV during vaginal intercourse may lead to cervical carcinogenesis, but the process has multiple steps, involves regression, and is generally not rapid. Because of the slow progression of disease and the high likelihood of regression in this age group, evidence suggests that screening earlier than age 21 years, regardless of sexual history, would lead to more harm than benefit. Treatment of CIN 2 or CIN 3 among women younger than 21 years may increase risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes.2, 8</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Women Older Than 65 Years</strong></p>
<p>Joint guidelines from the American Cancer Society, American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, and American Society for Clinical Pathology (ACS/ASCCP/ASCP) define adequate prior screening as 3 consecutive negative cytology results or 2 consecutive negative cotesting results within 10 years before stopping screening, with the most recent test occurring within 5 years.6 The guidelines further state that routine screening should continue for at least 20 years after spontaneous regression or appropriate management of a precancerous lesion, even if this extends screening past age 65 years. Once screening has stopped, it should not resume in women older than 65 years, even if they report having a new sexual partner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Women Older Than 65 Years Who Have Not Been Adequately Screened</strong></p>
<p>Screening may be clinically indicated in older women with an inadequate or unknown screening history. Recent data suggest that one-fourth of women aged 45 to 64 years have not been screened for cervical cancer in the preceding 3 years.9 In particular, women with limited access to care, women from racial/ethnic minority groups, and women from countries where screening is not available may be less likely to meet criteria for adequate prior screening. Certain considerations may also support screening in women older than 65 years who are otherwise at high risk (ie, women with a history of high-grade precancerous lesions or cervical cancer, in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol, or a compromised immune system).2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Screening Interval</strong></p>
<p>Screening more frequently than every 3 years with cytology alone confers little additional benefit, with a large increase in harms, including additional procedures and assessment and treatment of transient lesions. Treatment of lesions that would otherwise resolve on their own is harmful because it can lead to procedures with unwanted adverse effects, including the potential for cervical incompetence and preterm labor during pregnancy. Evidence from RCTs, observational studies, and modeling studies suggest that a 5-year screening interval for primary hrHPV testing alone or cotesting offers the best balance of benefits and harms. Screening more frequently than every 5 years with primary hrHPV testing alone or cotesting does not substantially improve benefit but significantly increases the number of screening tests and colposcopies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Screening aims to identify high-grade precancerous cervical lesions to prevent progression to cervical cancer. High-grade cervical lesions may be treated with excisional and ablative therapies. Early-stage cervical cancer may be treated with surgery (hysterectomy) or chemotherapy. Treatment of precancerous lesions is less invasive than treatment of cancer.2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Race/Ethnicity, Geography, and Cervical Cancer</strong></p>
<p>The incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer remain relatively high among certain populations. The overall mortality rate from cervical cancer among African American women is 10.1 deaths per 100,000 women,10 which is more than twice the rate among white women (when adjusted for hysterectomy rate), although the gap has narrowed over time. Mortality is higher among older African American women. Several studies have found that African American women are screened for cervical cancer at rates similar to those for white women and that inadequate follow-up after screening and differences in treatment may be important contributing factors. The higher mortality rate in African American women may also be attributable, in part, to the higher than average rate of adenocarcinoma, which carries a worse prognosis than the most common type of cervical cancer (squamous cell carcinoma).10-12</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>American Indian/Alaska Native women also have higher rates of cervical cancer mortality (3.2 deaths per 100,000 women) than the US average.10 Factors driving this higher rate may include lower screening rates (16.5% of American Indian/Alaska Native women in the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System reported not receiving a Papanicolaou [Pap] test in the past 5 years)13 and inadequate follow-up.2 Hispanic women have a significantly higher incidence rate of cervical cancer and slightly higher mortality rate (2.6 deaths per 100,000 women [unadjusted for hysterectomy rate]), with especially high rates occurring along the Texas-Mexico border. Although white women overall have the lowest mortality rate from cervical cancer, white women living in geographically isolated and medically underserved areas (particularly Appalachia) have much higher mortality rates than the US average. Asian women also have lower screening rates, especially those who have recently immigrated to the United States and may have language or cultural barriers to screening.10</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to race/ethnicity and geography, insurance coverage plays an important role in access to cervical cancer screening; 23.1% of women without health insurance and 25.5% of women with no regular health care clinician reported not receiving a Pap test in the past 5 years, compared with 11.4% of the general population. Insurance status may interact with other demographic factors, such as race/ethnicity and age, to increase disparities.13 In addition, there are no screening data for women with disabilities and those who identify as lesbian or transgender.14-16</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Progress in reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality has been uneven. The most important factors contributing to higher incidence and mortality rates include financial, geographic, and language or cultural barriers to screening; barriers to follow-up; unequal treatment; and difference in cancer types, all of which vary across subpopulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Additional Approaches to Prevention</strong></p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&rsquo;s Advisory Council on Immunization Practice recommends routine HPV vaccination. A 2-dose schedule is recommended for girls and boys who initiate the vaccination series at ages 9 to 14 years. Three doses are recommended for girls and boys who initiate the vaccination series at ages 15 to 26 years and for those who have a compromised immune system.17 The overall effect of HPV vaccination on high-grade precancerous cervical lesions and cervical cancer is not yet known. Current trials have not yet provided data on long-term efficacy; therefore, the possibility that vaccination might reduce the need for screening with cytology or hrHPV testing is not established. Given these uncertainties, women who have been vaccinated should continue to be screened as recommended until further evidence accrues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Useful Resources</strong></p>
<p>The 2012 ACS/ASCCP/ASCP guidelines6 and 2015 interim guidance from the ASCCP and the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO)7 provide algorithms for follow-up of abnormal screening results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America have issued recommendations on screening for and management of cervical cancer in patients living with HIV.18</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute provides strategies for reducing cervical cancer mortality in its report &ldquo;Excess Cervical Cancer Mortality: A Marker for Low Access to Health Care in Poor Communities.&rdquo;19</p>",,199,"<p><strong>Other Considerations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>
<p>Participation in regular screening has a far greater effect on cervical cancer morbidity and mortality than which of the 3 recommended screening strategies is chosen for women ages 30 to 65 years. Implementation should therefore focus on ensuring that women receive adequate screening, regardless of which strategy is used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although low screening rates contribute to high mortality rates in certain underserved populations, screening alone is not sufficient to reduce cervical cancer morbidity and mortality and related disparities. Loss to follow-up and disparities in treatment are also contributing factors. Therefore, having systems in place to ensure follow-up of abnormal results, appropriate treatment of any pathology, and support to retain patients throughout the entirety of cancer treatment are important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Research Needs and Gaps</strong></p>
<p>Regular screening for prevention of cervical cancer is highly effective, whether it is with cervical cytology alone, hrHPV testing alone, or both in combination. To further reduce the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer, it is necessary to find effective strategies to reach inadequately screened and unscreened women and to address follow-up and treatment issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research is needed to evaluate whether different screening strategies could play a part in reducing mortality rates, as well as ways to improve follow-up for current screening strategies and to ensure equitable access to treatment across populations. In addition, research is needed to determine whether screening after age 65 years has a different balance of benefits and harms in different subpopulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike cytology, samples for hrHPV testing have the potential to be collected by the patient and mailed to health programs for analysis, meaning self-collection may be one strategy for increasing screening rates among populations where they are currently low. Rigorous comparative studies are needed to verify this hypothesis and to identify effective strategies for implementation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another important area for future research is the effect of HPV vaccination, because an increasing number of women and men of screening age are being vaccinated. Decreases in hrHPV type prevalence due to vaccination could reduce the positive predictive value of hrHPV testing, which, along with potential reductions in cancer incidence, may increase the number of false-positive results and, therefore, the balance of benefits and harms. In either case, screening strategies may need to be adjusted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation replaces the 2012 USPSTF recommendation. The major change in the current recommendation is that the USPSTF now recommends screening every 5 years with hrHPV testing alone as an alternative to screening every 3 years with cytology alone among women aged 30 to 65 years. These are the 2 preferred screening strategies based on the USPSTF review of trial, cohort, and modeling results. Cotesting as an alternative strategy has demonstrated similar effectiveness, although it may result in more tests and procedures compared with either cytology or hrHPV testing alone. As in the 2012 recommendation, the USPSTF continues to recommend against screening in women younger than 21 years, in women older than 65 years who have had adequate prior screening and are not otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer, and in women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix and do not have a history of a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations of Others</strong></p>
<p>The ACS/ASCCP/ASCP recommend that women aged 21 to 29 years be screened every 3 years with cytology alone (cervical cytology or Pap testing). Women aged 30 to 65 years should be screened every 5 years with cytology and HPV testing (cotesting) or every 3 years with cytology alone. Women at increased risk of cervical cancer (ie, women with a history of cervical cancer, a compromised immune system, or diethylstilbestrol exposure) may need to be screened more often. Women who have had CIN 2+ should continue screening for 20 years after the last abnormal test result, even if it extends screening beyond age 65 years.6 The ASCCP and SGO issued interim guidance in 2015 that recommended primary HPV screening starting at age 25 years as an alternative to cytology alone or cotesting.7 The American Academy of Family Physicians guidelines are in agreement with the USPSTF.65 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stated in 2016 that cytology alone and cotesting are still specifically recommended in current guidelines from most major societies; however, primary HPV screening in women 25 years or older can be considered as an alternative to current cytology-based screening if performed per ASCCP and SGO interim guidance.66 The Panel on Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents has issued guidance on screening for and management of HPV in patients living with HIV.18</p>",,"<p><strong>Importance</strong></p>
<p>The number of deaths from cervical cancer in the United States have decreased substantially since the implementation of widespread cervical cancer screening and continue to decline, from 2.8 per 100,000 women in 2000 to 2.3 deaths per 100,000 women in 2015.1 Most cases of cervical cancer occur among women who have not been adequately screened.2 Strategies that aim to ensure that all women are appropriately screened and receive adequate follow-up are most likely to succeed in further reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality in the United States.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Detection</strong></p>
<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening with cervical cytology alone, primary testing for high-risk HPV types (hrHPV testing) alone, or in combination at the same time (cotesting) can detect high-grade precancerous cervical lesions and cervical cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>USPSTF Assessment</strong></p>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the benefits of screening every 3 years with cytology alone in women aged 21 to 29 years substantially outweigh the harms. The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the benefits of screening every 3 years with cytology alone, every 5 years with hrHPV testing alone, or in combination in women aged 30 to 65 years outweigh the harms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the benefits of screening in women older than 65 years who have had adequate prior screening and are not otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer do not outweigh the potential harms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of screening in women younger than 21 years outweigh the benefits.</p>

<p>The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the harms of screening in women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix for indications other than a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer outweigh the benefits.</p>",Screening for Cervical Cancer,"Cervical Cancer, Screening, 2018",,,,,
51,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic children and adolescents aged 10 to 18 years. This recommendation does not apply to children and adolescents presenting for evaluation of back pain, breathing difficulties, abnormal radiography findings or other imaging studies, or obvious deformities in spinal curvature.</p>
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
<p>Most screening tests for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis are noninvasive. Screening is usually done by visual inspection of the spine to look for asymmetry of the shoulders, shoulder blades, and hips. In the United States, the forward bend test is commonly used to screen for idiopathic scoliosis. First, a clinician visually inspects the spine of a patient while the patient is standing upright. Next, the patient stands with feet together and bends forward at the waist with arms hanging and palms touching. The clinician repeats the visual inspection of the spine.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation4"">4</a></sup></span> A scoliometer, which measures the angle of trunk rotation, may be used during the forward bend test. An angle of trunk rotation of 5&deg; to 7&deg; is often the threshold for referral for radiography.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup> Other screening tests include a humpometer, the plumb line test, and Moir&eacute; topography (creating a 3-dimensional image of the surface of a patient&rsquo;s back) (<a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#tab"">Table</a>).</p>
<p>If idiopathic scoliosis is suspected, radiography is used to confirm the diagnosis and to quantify the degree of curvature (ie, the Cobb angle) and the Risser sign (the stage of ossification of the iliac apophysis).<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup> US organizations that advocate screening recommend the forward bend test combined with scoliometer measurement.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>The goal of treatment is to decrease or stop progression of spinal curvature during the period of adolescent growth prior to skeletal maturity. Treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is determined by the degree of spinal curvature and the potential for further growth and generally includes observation, bracing, surgery, and exercise.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
<p>Most children and adolescents with scoliosis do not have symptoms. Generally, smaller spinal curvatures remain stable, while larger curvatures tend to progress in severity.</p>
<p>Pulmonary dysfunction can be clinically significant in patients with spinal curvatures greater than 100&deg;; however, curvatures of that severity are rare. Back pain is more common, but its effect on functioning or disability is unclear.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup> Current evidence suggests that the presence of back pain does not necessarily correlate with the degree of spinal curvature in adulthood. Adults with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis may have poor self-reported health, appearance, and social interactions. Mortality is similar to that among unaffected adults.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup></p>
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
<p>Evidence on the harms of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is limited. False-positive results are an important potential harm, with rates ranging from 0.8% to 21.5%.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation5"">5</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation6"">6</a></sup></span> However, the direct harms of screening are unclear. Potential harms of false-positive results include unnecessary follow-up visits, increased cancer risk attributable to radiation exposure, overtreatment, or psychosocial effects associated with the diagnosis of clinically nonsignificant scoliosis.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup></p>
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
<p>Various organizations have recommended routine screening for scoliosis in children and adolescents since the 1980s.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation4"">4</a></sup></span> More than half of US states either mandate or recommend school-based screening for scoliosis.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation4"">4</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation7"">7</a></sup></span> Children and adolescents are usually screened with the forward bend test, with or without scoliometer measurement.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation4"">4</a></sup></span></p>
<p>In general, patients with a Cobb angle of less than 20&deg; are observed without treatment; however, exercise may be recommended at this time. Patients with a Cobb angle greater than 30&deg; or a Cobb angle of 20&deg; to 30&deg; that progresses 5&deg; or more over 3 to 6 months are treated with bracing. Patients with a Cobb angle of 40&deg; to 50&deg; may be treated with bracing or surgery, while those with a Cobb angle greater than 50&deg; typically require surgery.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup></p>",,187,"<h3>Other Considerations</h3>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
<p>The USPSTF identified several research gaps. Prospective, controlled screening studies that allow for comparison of screened and nonscreened populations and different screening settings, personnel, and procedures are needed. Good-quality studies with prospective identification of cohorts at the time of diagnosis (eg, from geographical areas with and without routine screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis) or treatment (eg, treated vs observed cohorts) for the purpose of long-term follow-up are important. High-quality studies on the potential harms of screening and treatment are also needed. Additional studies to help determine whether individual characteristics (eg, body mass index) may influence response to bracing treatment would be helpful. Studies on long-term outcomes are needed and should stratify results by degree of spinal curvature at diagnosis and at skeletal maturity. Better information on long-term outcomes such as pulmonary disorders, disability, back pain, psychological effects, cosmetic issues, and quality of life would be helpful. Good-quality studies on treatment with exercise, bracing, and surgery among screen-detected patients are needed. Studies conducted in primary care settings are also needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations of Others</strong></p>
<p>Several national specialty groups have published statements in support of screening. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, the Scoliosis Research Society, the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America, and the American Academy of Pediatrics advocate screening for scoliosis in girls at 10 and 12 years and once in male adolescents at 13 or 14 years as part of medical home preventive services, if screening is performed by well-trained screening personnel.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation26""><span style=""font-size: small;"">26</span></a></sup> The UK National Screening Society does not recommend screening for scoliosis, given the uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness of screening and treatment.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation27""><span style=""font-size: small;"">27</span></a></sup> However, the International Society on Scoliosis Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treatment recommends screening for idiopathic scoliosis through school-based programs, and that screening should be performed by clinicians who specialize in spinal deformities.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation28""><span style=""font-size: small;"">28</span></a></sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><sup><span style=""font-size: small;"">Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation</span></sup></strong></p>
<p>This recommendation updates the 2004 USPSTF recommendation, in which the USPSTF recommended against routine screening for idiopathic scoliosis in asymptomatic adolescents (D recommendation).<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation8""><span style=""font-size: small;"">8</span></a></sup> In 2004, the USPSTF found fair evidence that treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis leads to health benefits (ie, decreased pain and disability) in a small proportion of persons. The USPSTF bounded the harms of treatment as moderate (eg, unnecessary brace wear or unnecessary referral to specialty care). Therefore, at that time, the USPSTF concluded that the harms of screening exceeded the potential benefits.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation8""><span style=""font-size: small;"">8</span></a></sup></p>
<p>To update its recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review of the evidence. Because of new research, the USPSTF determined that it no longer has moderate certainty that the harms of treatment outweigh the benefits. The USPSTF found no direct evidence of a benefit of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis on health outcomes. A growing body of evidence suggests that brace treatment can interrupt or slow scoliosis progression; however, evidence on whether reducing spinal curvature in adolescence has a long-term effect on health in adulthood is inadequate. Evidence on the effects of exercise and surgery on health or spinal curvature in childhood or adulthood is insufficient. Although the USPSTF previously found that treatment has moderate harms, a change in the analytic framework, outcomes, and applicability of older evidence resulted in the USPSTF assessing the evidence on harms of treatment as inadequate. As a result, the USPSTF has determined that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, leading the USPSTF to issue an I statement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1,"<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is a lateral curvature of the spine of unknown cause with a Cobb angle (a measure of the curvature of the spine) of at least 10&deg; that occurs in children and adolescents aged 10 to 18 years. It is the most common form of scoliosis and usually worsens during adolescence before skeletal maturity. In the United States, the estimated prevalence of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis with a Cobb angle of at least 10&deg; among children and adolescents aged 10 to 16 years is 1% to 3%.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation2"">2</a></sup></span> Most patients with a spinal curvature of greater than 40&deg; at skeletal maturity will likely experience curvature progression in adulthood. Severe spinal curvature may be associated with adverse long-term health outcomes (eg, pulmonary disorders, disability, back pain, psychological effects, cosmetic issues, and reduced quality of life).<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis-screening1#citation3"">3</a></sup></span> Therefore, early identification and effective treatment of mild scoliosis could slow or stop curvature progression before skeletal maturity, thereby improving long-term outcomes in adulthood.</p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that currently available screening tests can accurately detect adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The accuracy of screening was highest (93.8% sensitivity and 99.2% specificity) when 3 separate screening tests were used (eg, the forward bend test, scoliometer measurement, and Moir&eacute; topography); sensitivity was lower when screening programs used just 1 or 2 screening tests (eg, 71.1% for the forward bend test and scoliometer measurement and 84.4% for the forward bend test alone).</p>
<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found no direct evidence regarding the effect of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis on patient-centered health outcomes. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the treatment of idiopathic scoliosis (Cobb angle &lt;50&deg; at diagnosis) in adolescents with exercise (2 small studies) or surgery (no studies) or its effects on health outcomes or the degree of spinal curvature in childhood or adulthood. The USPSTF found adequate evidence (5 studies) that treatment with bracing may decrease curvature progression in adolescents with mild or moderate curvature severity (an intermediate outcome). However, it found inadequate evidence on the association between reduction in spinal curvature in adolescence and long-term health outcomes in adulthood.</p>
<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found no studies on the direct harms of screening, such as psychological harms or harms associated with confirmatory radiography. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine the harms of treatment.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis cannot be determined.</p>",Screening for Scoliosis in Adolescents (Idiopathic),"Scoliosis in Adolescents (Idiopathic), Screening, 2018",,,,,
52,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to adults without a history of transient ischemic attack, stroke, or other neurologic signs or symptoms. It was based on evidence of the benefits and harms of screening using ultrasonography to detect narrowing of the carotid arteries. A previous USPSTF review on the assessment of carotid intima&ndash;media thickness in 2009 found insufficient evidence to support its use as a screen for coronary heart disease risk. For this recommendation, the USPSTF did not review new evidence on ultrasonography to characterize carotid plaque structure or intima&ndash;media thickness and their association with cardiovascular disease events. However, clinicians considering using ultrasonography to characterize carotid plaque to stratify patient risk for cardiovascular disease should consider the same harms that the USPSTF evaluated for this recommendation (stroke, myocardial infarction, and death from CEA) because surgery may result from this screen.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
The major risk factors for carotid artery stenosis include older age, male sex, hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, and heart disease. Despite evidence on important risk factors, there are no externally validated, reliable methods to determine who is at increased risk for carotid artery stenosis or for stroke when carotid artery stenosis is present.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Although screening with ultrasonography has few direct harms, all screening strategies, including those with or without confirmatory tests (that is, digital subtraction or magnetic resonance angiography), have imperfect sensitivity and could lead to unnecessary surgery and result in serious harms, including death, stroke, and myocardial infarction. There is no evidence that screening by auscultation of the neck to detect carotid bruits is accurate or provides benefit.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The USPSTF has made recommendations on many factors related to stroke prevention, including screening for hypertension, screening for dyslipidemia, the use of nontraditional coronary heart disease risk factors, counseling on smoking, and counseling on healthful diet and physical activity. In addition, the USPSTF recommends the use of aspirin for persons at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. These recommendations are available on the USPSTF Web site (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>). &nbsp;<a name=""other""></a>
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Valid and reliable tools are needed to determine which persons are at high risk for carotid artery stenosis or for stroke due to carotid artery stenosis and who might experience harm from treatment with CEA or CAAS. Studies comparing CEA or CAAS with current standard medical therapy are needed. The planned CREST-2 (Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial 2) may provide important data for future recommendations. CREST-2 will study 2400 patients with greater than 70% stenosis who are randomly assigned to CAAS with intensive medical management versus intensive medical management alone or to CEA with intensive medical management versus intensive medical management alone.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/cas/casfinalrs.htm#consider,146,"In 2010, the American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association recommended against screening the general population for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. In 2011, the American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Heart Association, in collaboration with several other organizations, including the American Stroke Association, American Association of Neurological Surgeons, American College of Radiology, American Society of Neuroradiology, Society for Vascular Surgery, and Society for Vascular Medicine, recommended against the use of carotid DUS for routine screening of asymptomatic patients with no clinical manifestations of or risk factors for atherosclerosis. The Society for Vascular Surgery also released a guideline in 2011 stating that routine screening to detect clinically asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in the general population is not recommended. The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends against screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in the general adult population.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/cas/casfinalrs.htm#recommendations,,Screening for Carotid Artery Stenosis,"Carotid Artery Stenosis, Screening, 2014",,,,,
53,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to adults aged 18 years or older in primary care settings who are overweight or obese and have known CVD risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired fasting glucose, or the metabolic syndrome). In the studies reviewed by the USPSTF, the vast majority of participants had a BMI greater than 25 kg/m2.
<h3>Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>
Most studies evaluated interventions that combined counseling on a healthful diet and physical activity and were intensive, with multiple contacts (which may have included individual or group counseling sessions) over extended periods. Interventions involved an average of 5 to 16 contacts over 9 to 12 months depending on their intensity. Most of the sessions were in-person, and many included additional telephone contacts. Interventions generally focused on behavior change, and all included didactic education plus additional support. Most included audit and feedback, problem-solving skills, and individualized care plans. Some trials also focused on medication adherence. Interventions were delivered by specially trained professionals, including dietitians or nutritionists, physiotherapists or exercise professionals, health educators, and psychologists. <br /><br />Many types of intensive counseling interventions were effective. However, it was not clear how the magnitude of the effect was related to the format of the intervention (for example, face-to-face, individual, group, or telephone), the person providing the counseling, the duration of the intervention, or the number of sessions because different combinations of components were effective (see the <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/cvdhighrisk/cvdhighriskfinalrs.htm#implement"">Implementation section</a>for more information on effective interventions). Because of the intensity and expertise required, most interventions were referred from primary care and delivered outside that setting.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
Tobacco use continues to be one of the most important risk factors for CVD. Helping patients with tobacco cessation is a critical component of CVD prevention. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use and provide tobacco cessation interventions to those who use such products. The U.S. Public Health Service has published guidelines to further help clinicians.<br /><br />Multifaceted approaches with linkages between primary care practices and community resources could increase the effectiveness of interventions. Effective interactions between health care and community interventions, specifically public health and health policy interventions (such as healthy community design and built environment), can support and enhance the effectiveness of clinical interventions (more information is available at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/healthyplaces"">www.cdc.gov/healthyplaces</a>). The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends several community-based interventions to promote physical activity, including community-wide campaigns, social support interventions, school-based physical education, and environmental and policy approaches. It also recommends programs promoting diet and physical activity for persons who are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes on the basis of strong evidence of the effectiveness of these programs in reducing the incidence of new-onset diabetes. These recommendations are available at <a href=""http://www.thecommunityguide.org/"">www.thecommunityguide.org</a>.<br /><br />The Million Hearts initiative (<a href=""http://millionhearts.hhs.gov/"">http://millionhearts.hhs.gov</a>) aims to decrease the number of heart attacks and strokes by 1 million by 2017. It emphasizes the use of effective clinical preventive services combined with multifaceted community prevention strategies.<br /><br />In 2010, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services jointly issued the &ldquo;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&rdquo;. The latter also issued complementary physical activity guidelines.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The USPSTF has a wide range of recommendations focusing on CVD prevention. The current recommendation focuses on behavioral counseling that encourages healthy eating and physical activity behaviors to improve cardiovascular health. It does not address weight-loss programs. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively initiate behavioral counseling to promote a healthful diet and physical activity in patients who are not obese and not at increased cardiovascular risk. The USPSTF does not address behavioral counseling in patients with a BMI less than 25 kg/m2 who are at increased risk for CVD. However, for patients with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater, the USPSTF recommends screening these patients for obesity and offering or referring them to intensive, multicomponent behavioral counseling for weight loss.<br /><br />In another recommendation, the USPSTF recommends screening for lipid disorders in adults according to age and risk factors. It also recommends screening for blood pressure in adults, screening for diabetes in patients with elevated blood pressure, and aspirin use when appropriate. These recommendations are available at <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>.<br />&nbsp;
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
The USPSTF defines behavioral counseling interventions as preventive services that are designed to help persons engage in healthy behaviors and limit unhealthy ones. The USPSTF previously described the challenges of developing behavioral counseling recommendations that are feasible for primary care delivery or available for referral from primary care and delivered in other settings. Two well-researched interventions, the DPP (Diabetes Prevention Program) and PREMIER, could feasibly be adapted and delivered in the primary care setting or by local community providers. These interventions are described in further detail because they can be provided by an appropriately trained counselor (typically a dietitian, nutritionist, health educator, or psychologist) and their materials are publicly available. Descriptions of all of the reviewed interventions are included in the evidence review.<br /><br />The DPP focused on whether weight reduction through a healthful diet and physical activity could prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. Participants in the lifestyle intervention group received intensive training in diet, physical activity, and behavior modification from a case manager or lifestyle coach. Lifestyle coaches were dietitians or persons with a master's degree and training in exercise physiology, behavioral psychology, or health education. Participants received basic information about nutrition, physical activity, and behavioral self-management. The program addressed problem solving and strategies to deal with eating at restaurants, stress, and lapses. Participants and coaches engaged in face-to-face sessions at least once every 2 months and talked by telephone at least once between visits. The DPP study documents, including coach and participant materials, are available online in English and Spanish (<a href=""https://dppos.bsc.gwu.edu/web/dppos/lifestyle"">https://dppos.bsc.gwu.edu/web/dppos/lifestyle</a>). At least 1 trial included in the review&nbsp;used an adapted DPP lifestyle intervention in patients recruited from a primary care setting. The trial was conducted in a large multispecialty group practice. Investigators tested a coach-led intervention and a home-based, DVD-facilitated intervention, as well as a Web-based portal for goal setting and self-monitoring. The materials used for the intervention are available online from the University of Pittsburgh Diabetes Prevention Support Center (<a href=""http://www.diabetesprevention.pitt.edu/"">www.diabetesprevention.pitt.edu</a>).<br /><br />PREMIER tested whether counseling on comprehensive lifestyle changes could prevent or control high blood pressure. Participants in the intensive intervention group were counseled over 6 months to track their diet (including calorie and sodium consumption) and physical activity and received printed materials about blood pressure and lifestyle changes. In addition, they were taught to follow the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which is rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products and emphasizes reduced intake of saturated and total fat. The intervention was delivered by dietitians or health educators with a master's degree. The materials from this intervention, including participant manuals, food and fitness guides, and food diaries, are available online at <a href=""http://www.kpchr.org/research/public/premier/premier.htm"">www.kpchr.org/research/public/premier/premier.htm</a>. Information about the DASH diet is available from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Trials examining the effectiveness of less intensive counseling that can be delivered in the primary care setting, including the minimum intensity, number of interactions, and duration necessary for effectiveness, are needed, as are trials studying the duration of effect beyond 2 to 3 years of follow-up or beyond the intensive counseling intervention period. The effectiveness of interventions for physical activity alone has not been well-studied. Trials examining the interaction or potentiation of clinical counseling and community-based lifestyle interventions are needed. Finally, the lack of direct evidence of effect on CVD events is an important research gap. Advances in management of CVD risk factors and relatively low rates of CVD events in study populations present a challenge to researchers trying to assess differences in CVD outcomes.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/cvdhighrisk/cvdhighriskfinalrs.htm#summary,147,"The American Heart Association recommends that clinicians use counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity that include a combination of 2 or more of the following strategies: setting specific, proximal goals; providing feedback on progress; providing strategies for self-monitoring; establishing a plan for frequency and duration of follow-up; using motivational interviews; and building self-efficacy.<br /><br />The American College of Sports Medicine has published recommendations for health professionals who counsel healthy adults on individualized exercise programs. It recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week and 2 to 3 days of resistance, flexibility, and neuromotor exercises per week. Previous statements by the American Academy of Family Physicians about counseling for diet and physical activity have been consistent with those of the USPSTF; it is currently updating its recommendations.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/cvdhighrisk/cvdhighriskfinalrs.htm#recommendations,,Behavioral Counseling to Promote a Healthful Diet and Physical Activity for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in Adults With Cardiovascular Risk Factors,"Healthful Diet and Physical Activity for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in Adults With CVD Risk Factors, Counseling, 2014",,,,,
54,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to asymptomatic, nonpregnant adolescents and adults at high risk for HBV infection (including those at high risk who were vaccinated before being screened for HBV infection).
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
A major risk factor for HBV infection is country of origin. The risk for HBV infection varies substantially by country of origin in foreign-born persons in the United States. Persons born in countries with a prevalence of HBV infection of 2% or greater account for 47% to 95% of those with chronic HBV infection in the United States (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/hepb/hepbfinalrs.htm#tab1"">Table 1</a>). Another important risk factor for HBV infection is lack of vaccination in infancy in U.S.-born persons with parents from a country or region with high prevalence (&ge;8%), such as sub-Saharan Africa, central and southeast Asia, and China (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/hepb/hepbfinalrsfig.htm"">Figure</a>). Because HBV infection prevalence may gradually change over time, it is important to note that some countries and regions with prevalence rates between 5-7% are considered to be highly endemic areas. <br /><br /><strong>Table 1.

<br />* Data from United States and western Europe. <br /><br /><strong>Abbreviation: </strong>HBV = hepatitis B virus. <br /><br />The CDC also recommends screening in persons receiving hemodialysis or cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy (for example, chemotherapy for malignant diseases and immunosuppression related to organ transplantation and for rheumatologic and gastroenterologic disorders). <br /><br />Some persons with combinations of risk factors who are not members of one of these risk factor groups may also be at increased risk for HBV infection. However, reliable information about combinations of risk factors is not available. Clinicians should exercise their judgment in deciding whether these persons are at sufficiently high risk to warrant screening. For example, screening is probably appropriate in settings that treat a large proportion of persons at increased risk, such as clinics for sexually transmitted infections; HIV testing and treatment centers; health care settings that provide services for injection drug users or men who have sex with men; correctional facilities; and institutions that serve populations from countries with a high prevalence of infection, including community health centers. <br /><br />The prevalence of HBV infection is low in the general U.S. population, and most infected persons do not develop complications. Therefore, screening is not recommended in those who are not at increased risk. The USPSTF notes that high rates of HBV infection have been found in cities and other areas with high numbers of immigrants or migrant persons from Asia or the Pacific Islands or their adult children. Providers should consider the population they serve when making screening decisions.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
The CDC recommends screening for HBsAg with tests approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, followed by a licensed, neutralizing confirmatory test for initially reactive results. Immunoassays for detecting HBsAg have a reported sensitivity and specificity greater than 98%. A positive HBsAg result indicates acute or chronic infection. <br /><br />Testing for antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs) and hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) is also done as part of a screening panel to help distinguish between infection and immunity. Acute HBV infection (acquired within 6 months after infection) is characterized by the appearance of HBsAg and followed by the appearance of IgM anti-HBc. The disappearance of HBsAg and the presence of anti-HBs and anti-HBc indicate the resolution of HBV infection and natural immunity. Anti-HBc, which persist for life, are present only after HBV infection and do not develop in persons whose immunity to HBV is due to vaccination.<br /><br />Persons who have received HBV vaccination have only anti-HBs. Diagnosis of chronic HBV infection is characterized by persistence of HBsAg for at least 6 months. Levels of HBV DNA can fluctuate and are not a reliable marker of chronic infection.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<h4>Antiviral Regimens</h4>
The goals of antiviral treatment are to achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication and remission of liver disease to prevent cirrhosis, hepatic failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Interferons or nucleoside or nucleotide analogues are used to treat HBV infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved 7 antiviral drugs for treatment of chronic HBV infection: interferon-&alpha;2b, pegylated interferon-&alpha;2a, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, telbivudine, and tenofovir. Approved first-line treatments are pegylated interferon-&alpha;2a, entecavir, and tenofovir. Combination therapies have been evaluated but are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and are generally not used as first-line treatment because tolerability, efficacy, and rates of resistance are low.&nbsp; <br /><br />Several factors affect the choice of antiviral drug, including patient characteristics, HBV DNA and serum aminotransferase levels, and HBeAg status. Biopsy is sometimes done to determine the extent of liver inflammation and fibrosis. Surrogate end points of antiviral treatment include loss of HBeAg and HBsAg, HBeAg seroconversion in HBeAg-positive patients, and suppression of HBV DNA to undetectable levels by polymerase chain reaction in patients who are HBeAg-negative and anti-HBe&ndash;positive. Duration of treatment varies depending on the time required to suppress HBV DNA levels and normalize alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels; HBeAg status; the presence of cirrhosis; and the choice of drug.
<h4>Vaccination</h4>
The current U.S. strategy to eliminate HBV transmission includes universal vaccination of all infants at birth and vaccination of adolescents and high-risk adults, such as injection drug users and household contacts of patients with HBV infection. Three doses of HBV vaccine result in a protective antibody response of greater than 90% in adults and greater than 95% in adolescents. The CDC recommends that susceptible persons who are screened for HBV infection may, if indicated, receive the first dose of the HBV vaccine at the same medical visit.
<h3>Screening Interval</h3>
Periodic screening may be useful in patients with ongoing risk for HBV transmission (for example, active injection drug users, men who have sex with men, and patients receiving hemodialysis) who do not receive vaccination. Clinical judgment should determine screening frequency, because the USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine specific screening intervals.<a name=""other""></a>
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
The development and validation of clinical decision support or other tools to help clinicians efficiently and accurately identify populations at high risk for HBV infection, including combinations of risk factors, are needed. Available clinical trials largely report intermediate or surrogate outcomes and are relatively short. Clinical trials of adequate duration and power to evaluate long-term health outcomes (for example, cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, disease-specific mortality, quality of life, and all-cause mortality) are needed. In the absence of such randomized, controlled trials, registries to assess treatment efficacy are also needed.

55,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults age 50 years and older.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
<h4>Smoking Status</h4>
Consuming 100 or more cigarettes is commonly used in epidemiologic literature to define an &ldquo;ever-smoker.&rdquo; However, the randomized trials of screening for AAA did not gather specific data about participants' smoking histories. Occasional tobacco use for a short time in the past (for example, occasional &ldquo;social&rdquo; smoking as an adolescent or young adult) is unlikely to have a pronounced biological effect, and the odds ratio (OR) of developing a large (&ge;5.0 cm) AAA is actually less than 1.0 for prior smokers who have quit for at least 10 years. However, observational studies have found that even a relatively modest smoking history (for example, smoking a half-pack or less per day for fewer than 10 years) does increase the likelihood of developing a large AAA.
<h4>Screening in Men Ages 65 to 75 Years Who Have Never Smoked</h4>
Despite the demonstrated benefits of screening for AAA in men overall, the lower prevalence of AAA in male never-smokers versus male ever-smokers suggests that clinicians should consider a patient's risk factors and the potential for harm before screening for AAA rather than routinely offering screening to all male never-smokers. Important risk factors for AAA include older age and a first-degree relative with an AAA; other risk factors include a history of other vascular aneurysms, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and hypertension. Factors associated with a reduced risk for AAA include African American race, Hispanic ethnicity, and diabetes.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Screening in Women Ages 65 to 75 Years Who Have Ever Smoked</h4>
<strong>Potential Preventable Burden</strong> <br /><br />A screening study in Sweden found that the prevalence of AAA in women age 70 years was low (0.8%) for ever-smokers but increased to 2.0% for current smokers. A meta-analysis of individual-patient data found that women have a higher risk than men for AAA rupture at the same diameter (hazard ratio [HR], 3.76 [95% CI, 2.58 to 5.47]). However, AAA-associated deaths occur at an older age in women (at a time of increased competing causes of death and a declining benefit&ndash;risk ratio for operative interventions), with 70% of deaths occurring after age 80 years in women compared with fewer than 50% in men. In the only screening RCT that included women, most screen-detected AAAs in women were small (3.0 to 3.9 cm) and AAA-specific mortality was low in screened and unscreened women (&lt;0.2%) after 10 years. <br /><br /><strong>Potential Harms</strong> <br /><br />Four RCTs (primarily done in men) showed that screening for AAA doubled the rate of AAA-associated surgeries, largely driven by an increase in elective surgeries. Most screen-detected AAAs were below the 5.5-cm threshold for immediate repair. This finding generally results in long-term or lifelong surveillance and is probably associated with some amount of overtreatment, although the magnitude of this burden is difficult to quantify. <br /><br />Most screening trials reported an associated decrease in emergency AAA repairs and a reduced 30-day mortality rate associated with emergency surgery in populations invited to screen, although mortality associated with elective surgery was not reduced. Operative mortality associated with AAAs is higher in women than in men (7% vs. 5% for open repair and 2% vs. 1% for endovascular repair, respectively). <br /><br /><strong>Costs</strong> <br /><br />In addition to the cost of ultrasonography screening (approximately $100), the estimated potential associated cost of elective surgery to repair a screen-detected AAA ranges from $37,000 to $43,000. Potential opportunity costs also may arise, because screening may take the place of other preventive activities that may be of greater benefit to the patient. <strong><br /><br />Current Practice <br /><br /></strong>Screening for AAA is provided as part of the &ldquo;welcome-to-Medicare visit&rdquo; for women who have a family history of AAA. However, the evidence is insufficient to accurately characterize current practice patterns related to screening for AAA in women.<br /><br /> A retrospective analysis from 2000 to 2010 used the National Inpatient Sample, a database that has a stratified 20% random sample of all nonfederal inpatient hospital admissions in the United States. This analysis found that women are more likely than men to have open surgery versus endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for unruptured AAA (24% vs. 17%, respectively), potentially because of issues with access to the iliac artery (that is, smaller artery size) that may preclude endovascular management. <br /><br />A retrospective review of 4,026 AAA repairs in the Vascular Study Group of New England database (a voluntary registry from 30 academic and community hospitals in six New England states) reported that women were more likely than men to have open surgery versus EVAR and to be older and have smaller aortic diameters at the time of repair. Postoperative complications were higher in women than in men after elective EVAR or open repair, including emergency reoperations, dysrhythmias, leg ischemia or emboli, bowel ischemia, or need for discharge to another medical facility rather than home.
<h3>Screening Methods</h3>
Conventional abdominal duplex ultrasonography was the primary method used in the available trials of AAA screening. Primary care physicians and vascular surgeons widely accept abdominal duplex ultrasonography as the standard approach. Screening with ultrasonography is noninvasive and easy to do and has high sensitivity (94% to 100%) and specificity (98% to 100%) for detecting AAA. In addition, it has shown high rates of reproducibility, does not expose patients to radiation, and is relatively low-cost.<br /><br />The use of handheld, portable ultrasonography devices in clinician office settings has been proposed as an alternative approach to conventional abdominal duplex ultrasonography done in the radiology setting. Several small observational studies suggest that in-office handheld ultrasonography has reasonable sensitivity and specificity for AAA detection compared with conventional ultrasonography. However, it has not been formally evaluated in a clinical trial.
<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>
Evidence is adequate to support one-time screening in men who have ever smoked. All of the population-based RCTs of AAA screening used a one-time screening approach, and several fair- to good-quality prospective cohort studies show that AAA-associated mortality over 5 to 12 years is low (0.0% to 2.4%) in men with initially normal results on ultrasonography.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
In the available screening trials, immediate referral for open surgery in patients with large AAAs (&ge;5.5 cm) and conservative management via repeated ultrasonography every 3 to 12 months for smaller AAAs (3.0 to 5.4 cm) achieved the observed AAA-related mortality benefit. Surgical referral of smaller AAAs was reserved for AAAs that grew rapidly (&gt;1.0 cm per year) or reached a threshold of 5.5 cm or larger on repeated ultrasonography. <br /><br />Although early open surgery for smaller AAAs reduces the risk for rupture compared with surveillance, it does not reduce AAA-specific or all-cause mortality. Endovascular aneurysm repair is an alternative to open surgery. As with open surgery, early EVAR did not differ from surveillance for smaller AAAs in all-cause or AAA-related mortality in randomized trials that evaluated these interventions. Unlike early open surgery, early EVAR does not reduce the incidence of AAA rupture. <br /><br />Pharmacotherapy has been proposed to slow the growth of smaller AAAs. Short-term treatment with antibiotics or &beta;-blockers does not seem to reduce AAA growth, and the trials were underpowered to draw conclusions about effects on health outcomes.<br /><br /><br />
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Although evidence shows that women who smoke are at increased risk for AAA compared with nonsmoking women, evidence that screening this population confers a net benefit is insufficient. The same is true for men and women with a family history of AAA. Ideally, appropriately powered RCTs with planned a priori subgroup analyses would be done to answer these critical questions. In the absence of new trial data, high-quality modeling studies should be done to determine whether screening is beneficial in women who smoke or in men and women with a family history of AAA. <br /><br />Several risk-scoring tools have been developed and, if prospectively validated, could be used to identify patients most likely to benefit from screening. Thus, validation studies of these tools should be prioritized. Because of the importance of family history as a risk factor, the role of genetic markers of AAA development should be explored. <br /><br />Alternative strategies to reduce AAA growth, such as antibiotics, statins, or other novel pharmacologic agents, need to be further explored. Interventions to address modifiable risk factors (particularly smoking) may be worth considering. Effective strategies for smoking cessation may improve the care of patients with small AAAs. Seven ongoing RCTs are evaluating pharmacotherapeutic effects on small AAAs; however, the outcome in most trials is aneurysmal growth, and the trials are underpowered to detect changes in health outcomes. Appropriately powered studies that can assess health outcomes should evaluate whether such treatments are viable options in preventing death.<br /><br />One screening RCT, the VIVA (Viborg Vascular) trial, is currently evaluating the effectiveness of combined screening for AAA, peripheral artery disease, and hypertension in 50,000 men ages 65 to 74 years; results are not expected until after 2018. Participants who screen positive for AAA or peripheral artery disease are advised on exercise, low-fat diet, and smoking cessation and are managed with statins and aspirin. They receive annual surveillance for AAA and peripheral artery disease, and those with an AAA measuring 5.0 cm or larger are referred for surgery. <br /><br />Followup will occur at 3.5, 10, and 15 years for the primary outcome of all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes include cardiovascular mortality, AAA-specific mortality, AAA prevalence and progression, health-related quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. This study may also provide evidence as to whether a screen-detected AAA can be used as a marker and improve outcomes for other cardiovascular diseases.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf14/abdoman/abdomanfinalrs.htm#consider,145,"The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association jointly recommend one-time screening for AAA with physical examination and ultrasonography in men ages 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked and in men age 60 years or older who are the sibling or offspring of a person with AAA. These organizations do not recommend screening for AAA in men who have never smoked or in women. The Society for Vascular Surgery recommends one-time ultrasonography screening for AAA in men age 55 years or older with a family history of AAA, all men age 65 years or older, and women age 65 years or older who have smoked or have a family history of AAA. The American College of Preventive Medicine recommends one-time screening in men age 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked; it does not recommend routine screening in women.<br /><br />The Canadian Society for Vascular Surgery recommends ultrasonography screening for AAA in men age 65 to 75 years who are candidates for surgery and willing to participate. In individualized cases, some women older than 65 years with multiple risk factors for AAA (smoking history, cerebrovascular disease, or family history) may be considered for screening. The European Society for Vascular Surgery recommends that men should be screened for AAA with a single ultrasonography at age 65 years, but screening should be considered at an earlier age in men at higher risk (for example, those who smoke, have other cardiovascular disease, or have a family history). It notes that screening in older women generally does not reduce the incidence of aneurysm rupture but that screening women who smoke may require further investigation.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf14/abdoman/abdomanfinalrs.htm#recommendations,,Screening for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,"Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm, Screening, 2014",,,,,
56,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to children age 5 years and younger.<br /><br />The USPSTF limited its consideration of caries screening and prevention by primary care clinicians to infants and preschool-aged children. The rationale for this decision was that, at the present time, nondental primary care clinicians are more likely than dentists to have contact with children ages 5 years and younger in the United States; this situation changes as children reach school age and beyond. In addition, as children grow older, dental professionals use sealants rather than fluoride varnish. As such, the USPSTF limited its review of the evidence of preventive interventions for dental caries to this age group. This recommendation should not be construed to imply that preventive interventions for dental caries should cease after 5 years of age.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
All children are at potential risk for dental caries; those whose primary water supply is deficient in fluoride (defined as containing &lt;0.6 ppm F) are at particular risk. While there are no validated multivariate screening tools to determine which children are at higher risk for dental caries, there are a number of individual factors that elevate risk. Higher prevalence and severity of dental caries are found among minority and economically disadvantaged children. Other risk factors for caries in children include frequent sugar exposure, inappropriate bottle feeding, developmental defects of the tooth enamel, dry mouth, and a history of previous caries. Maternal and family factors can also increase children's risk. These factors include poor oral hygiene, low socioeconomic status, recent maternal caries, sibling caries, and frequent snacking. Additional factors associated with dental caries in young children include lack of access to dental care; inadequate preventive measures, such as failure to use fluoride-containing toothpastes; and lack of parental knowledge about oral health.<br /><br />Some organizations have advocated restricting fluoride varnish use to children at &ldquo;increased risk.&rdquo; Although several caries risk assessment tools exist, none have been validated in the primary care setting, nor do existing studies demonstrate that these tools, when used by primary care clinicians, can accurately and consistently differentiate between children who will develop dental caries and those who will not. A risk-based approach to fluoride varnish application will miss opportunities to provide an effective dental caries preventive intervention to children who could benefit from it, particularly because currently, in the United States, infants and preschool-aged children are more likely to have regular visits with nondental primary care clinicians than dental care providers.
<h3>Interventions to Prevent Dental Caries</h3>
As noted previously, oral fluoride supplementation prevents dental caries in patients with inadequate water fluoridation.<br /><br />All children with erupted teeth can potentially benefit from the periodic application of fluoride varnish, regardless of the levels of fluoride in their water. Though the evidence to support varnish is drawn from higher-risk populations, the provision of varnish to all children is reasonable since the prevalence of risk factors is high in the U.S. population, the number needed to treat is low, and the harms of the intervention are small to none.<br /><br />The USPSTF did not review the evidence on the effectiveness of tooth brushing, but regular tooth brushing with fluoride toothpaste by children is very important in preventing dental caries.
<h3>Timing and Dosage of Preventive Interventions</h3>
No studies specifically addressed the dosage and timing of oral fluoride supplementation in children with inadequate water fluoridation. The American Dental Association (ADA) recommendations on the dosage of and age at which to start dietary fluoride supplementation take into account the amount of fluoride in the child's water source. These dosing recommendations are also referenced by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).<br /><br />No study directly assessed the appropriate ages at which to start and stop the application of fluoride varnish. Available trials of fluoride varnish enrolled children ages 3 to 5 years; however, given the mechanism of action of this intervention, benefits are very likely to accrue starting at the time of primary tooth eruption. Limited evidence found no clear effect on caries increment between performing a single fluoride varnish once every 6 months versus once a year or between a single application every 6 months versus multiple applications once a year or every 6 months.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding I Statement</h3>
In deciding whether to routinely perform screening examinations for dental caries in children from birth to age 5 years, clinicians should consider the following.
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
Dental caries is the most common chronic disease in children in the United States. It is four times more common than childhood asthma and seven times more common than hay fever. According to the NHANES, the prevalence of dental caries has risen from 24% to 28% between 1988&ndash;1994 and 1999&ndash;2004. Approximately 20% of surveyed children with caries had not received treatment. Symptomatic dental caries in children are associated with pain, loss of teeth, impaired growth, and decreased weight gain and can affect appearance, self-esteem, speech, and school performance. Dental-related concerns lead to the loss of more than 54 million school hours each year .
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
No studies examined the harms of performing primary care screening examinations for dental caries in children from birth to age 5 years. However, given the noninvasive nature of an oral examination, these harms are expected to be minimal.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
In one study, only about half of pediatricians reported examining the teeth of half of their patients ages 0 to 3 years.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
In April 2013, the Community Preventive Services Task Force recommended fluoridation of community water sources based on strong evidence of effectiveness in reducing dental caries. It also recommends school-based dental sealant delivery programs to prevent caries. Xylitol may have promise as an additional method to reduce the risk for dental caries.<br /><br />Xylitol is classified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a dietary supplement and is found in over-the-counter consumer products such as wipes or gum. A single small, fair-quality trial of xylitol wipes use in children ages 6 to 35 months found a 91% relative reduction in decayed, missing, or filled surface increment. However, four other studies showed no clear effect of xylitol on caries risk in children younger than age 5 years. As such, there is currently not enough evidence to formally recommend its routine use in caries prevention.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
Many primary care providers already prescribe oral fluoride supplementation to patients with low levels of fluoride in their water; however, application of fluoride varnish is not currently commonly performed in many primary care offices (estimated at about 4% of practices in 2009). The techniques for application are simple and easy to learn, and fluoride varnish does not require specialized equipment or personnel and can be applied quickly. However, providers and other qualified staff may require some training before offering this procedure. Dentists and physicians can apply varnish in all states. In some states, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, and medical assistants can also do so. <br /><br />Efforts are underway to address concerns surrounding resources, infrastructure, training, and payment mechanisms for the provision of fluoride varnish in the nondental primary care setting. For example, the AAP Section on Oral Health has partnered with the Health Resources and Services Administration's Maternal and Child Health Bureau and the ADA Foundation to educate and advocate for primary pediatric care professionals to apply fluoride varnish. They have created a Web site with a number of helpful tools and resources to assist nondental primary care providers, including how to acquire the materials required to provide varnish, as well as state-by-state information on billing codes and any training requirements (available at <a href=""http://www2.aap.org/oralhealth/PracticeTools.html"">http://www2.aap.org/oralhealth/PracticeTools.html</a>). The National Interprofessional Initiative on Oral Health, a consortium of funders and health professionals, focuses on educating and training primary care clinicians on oral health prevention (additional information available at <a href=""http://www.niioh.org/"">http://www.niioh.org</a>).
<h3>Cost</h3>
State Medicaid reimbursement for fluoride varnish application, when offered, ranges from $9 to $53 per application when applied by licensed providers who have had appropriate training, including physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, and licensed practical nurses (varying by state).
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Studies are needed to assess and validate multivariate risk assessment tools that can accurately identify high-risk populations most likely to benefit from caries preventive interventions, such as fluoride varnish. <br /><br />Further research would also be helpful to confirm the benefits of fluoride varnish among lower-risk and younger children. <br /><br />Racial and ethnic minority children, as well as children living in low socioeconomic conditions, are at significantly increased risk for caries compared with white children and children who live in adequate to high socioeconomic conditions. Future studies on risk assessment and preventive interventions should enroll sufficient numbers of racial and ethnic minority children to understand the benefits and harms of interventions in these specific populations. <br /><br />More research is also needed to estimate the effectiveness of interventions by clinicians to educate parents and caregivers about optimum health practices for oral hygiene at home.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/dentalprek/dentchfinalrs.htm#consider,142,"The AAP has issued two policy statements related to dental care in children. The first, issued in 2003 and reaffirmed in 2009, encourages providers to incorporate oral health&ndash;related services into their practices. Specifically, the AAP recommends an oral health assessment for all children by age 6 months and a first dental visit by age 1 year. The second statement supports oral fluoride supplementation and application of fluoride varnish in children &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; for dental caries. <br /><br />The ADA recommends that children be seen by a dentist within 6 months of eruption of the first tooth and no later than age 12 months. It also recommends the application of fluoride varnish every 6 months in preschool-aged children who are at &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; risk for dental caries and every 3 to 6 months in children who are at &ldquo;high&rdquo; risk. It recommends daily dietary fluoride supplements for children from birth to age 16 years who are at &ldquo;high&rdquo; risk for developing dental caries and whose primary source of drinking water is deficient in fluoride; &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; status can be determined using risk assessment tools developed by one of several professional health organizations. Dietary fluoride supplementation is not recommended when water fluoridation levels are greater than 0.6 ppm F. <br /><br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that clinicians counsel parents about appropriate use of fluoridated toothpastes, especially in children age 2 years and younger; prescribe fluoride supplements to children at high risk for dental caries whose drinking water lacks adequate fluoridation; and limit the use of high-concentration fluoride products, such as varnish and gel, to high-risk individuals. <br /><br />The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry states that fluoride dietary supplements should be considered for children at risk for caries who drink fluoride-deficient (&lt;0.6 ppm) water. It also states that children at increased risk for caries should receive a professional fluoride treatment (e.g., 5% sodium fluoride varnish or 1.23% acidulated phosphate fluoride) every 6 months. <br /><br />The American Academy of Family Physicians is updating its recommendations on the subject.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/dentalprek/dentchfinalrs.htm#recommendations,,Prevention of Dental Caries in Children From Birth Through Age 5 Years,"Dental Caries in Children from Birth Through Age 5 Years, Screening and Interventions, 2014",,,,,
57,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to adolescents, adults, and older adults in the general U.S. population who do have an identified psychiatric disorder.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
In 2010, suicide accounted for more than 1.4 million years of potential life lost before age 85 years, or 4.3% of total years of potential life lost in the United States. Past studies estimated that 38% of adults (50% to 70% of older adults) visited their primary care provider within 1 month of dying by suicide. Nearly 90% of suicidal youths were seen in primary care during the previous 12 months.<br /><br />Given that most persons who die by suicide have a psychiatric disorder and many have been seen recently in primary care, primary care clinicians should be aware of psychiatric problems in their patients and should consider asking these patients about suicidal ideation and referring them for psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or case management. The USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians screen adolescents and adults for depression when appropriate systems are in place to ensure adequate diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. Primary care clinicians should also focus on patients during periods of high suicide risk, such as immediately after discharge from a psychiatric hospital or after an emergency department visit for deliberate self-harm. Recent evidence suggests that interventions during these high-risk periods are effective in reducing suicide deaths.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
Evidence on the potential harms of screening for suicide risk is insufficient.
<h4>Costs</h4>
The monetary cost of screening for suicide risk is minimal. Additional time would be needed in the primary care visit to accommodate screening.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
In a study of U.S. primary care providers, suicide was discussed in 11% of encounters with patients who had (unbeknown to their providers) screened positive for suicidal ideation. Similarly, 36% of U.S. primary care physicians explored suicide in encounters with standardized patients presenting with major depression or adjustment disorder or those who sought antidepressants. Less than one quarter of surveyed primary care pediatricians or family practice physicians in Maryland reported that they frequently or always screened adolescents for suicide risk factors.
<h3>Risk Factors for Suicide</h3>
Although evidence to determine whether the general asymptomatic population should be screened for suicide risk is inadequate, providers should consider identifying patients with risk factors or those who seem to have high levels of emotional distress and referring them for further evaluation.<br /><br />Suicide risk varies by age, sex, and race or ethnicity. In men, the greatest increases in suicide rate were in those aged 50 to 54 years (49.4% [from 20.6 to 30.7 deaths per 100,000]) and those aged 55 to 59 years (47.8% [from 20.3 to 30.0 deaths per 100,000]). In women, the suicide rate increased with age, and the largest percentage increase was in those aged 60 to 64 years (59.7% [from 4.4 to 7.0 deaths per 100,000]). <br /><br />American Indians and Alaskan natives aged 14 to 65 years and non-Hispanic white persons older than 18 years have higher-than-average rates of suicide death, and the risk among non-Hispanic white persons continues to increase after age 75 years. The highest rates are seen in American Indians and Alaskan natives aged 19 to 24 years and non-Hispanic white persons older than 75 years. Among adolescents, Hispanic females are at especially high risk for attempting suicide. <br /><br />The greatest increases in suicide rate from 1999 to 2010 by racial or ethnic population in men and women overall were among American Indians and Alaskan natives (65.2%) and white persons (40.4%). Among American Indians and Alaskan natives, the suicide rate in women increased by 81.4% (from 5.7 to 10.3 deaths per 100,000) and the rate in men increased by 59.5% (from 17.0 to 27.2 deaths per 100,000). Among white persons, the rate in women increased by 41.9% (from 7.4 to 10.5 deaths per 100,000) and the rate in men increased by 39.6% (from 24.5 to 34.2 deaths per 100,000). <br /><br />Increased risk is also associated with the presence of a mental health disorder, such as depression, schizophrenia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance use disorders. About 87% of patients who die by suicide meet the criteria for 1 or more mental health disorders. A lifetime history of depression more than doubles the odds of a suicide attempt in U.S. adults, and depression is probably present in 50% to 79% of youths attempting suicide, although it may not always be recognized. <br /><br />Other important risk factors for suicide attempt include serious adverse childhood events; family history of suicide; prejudice or discrimination associated with being lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender; access to lethal means; and possibly a history of being bullied, sleep disturbances, and such chronic medical conditions as epilepsy and chronic pain. In males, socioeconomic factors, such as low income, occupation, and unemployment, are also related to suicide risk. <br /><br />In older adults, additional risk factors, such as social isolation, spousal bereavement, neurosis, affective disorders, physical illness, and functional impairment, increase the risk for suicide. Risk factors of special importance to military veterans include traumatic brain injury, separation from service within the past 12 months, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other mental health conditions. <br /><br />Individual risk factors have limited ability to predict suicide in an individual at a particular time. A large proportion of Americans have 1 of these risk factors; however, only a small proportion will attempt suicide, and even fewer will die by it.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
The reviewed studies used various screening tools. One example is the Suicide Risk Screen, a 20-item screening instrument embedded in a broader self-report questionnaire administered in high schools to youths at risk for dropping out of school. Another tool consists of 3 suicide-related items (&ldquo;thoughts of death,&rdquo; &ldquo;wishing you were dead,&rdquo; and &ldquo;feeling suicidal&rdquo; within the past month) targeting primary care patients aged 18 to 70 years with scheduled appointments.<br /><br />Sensitivity and specificity of screening tools generally ranged from 52% to 100% and from 60% to 98%, respectively. The instruments showed a wide range in accuracy, but data were limited and no instruments were examined in more than 1 study.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
Most effective treatments to reduce risk for suicide attempt include psychotherapy. The most commonly studied psychotherapy intervention was cognitive behavioral therapy and related approaches, including dialectical behavior therapy, problem-solving therapy, and developmental group therapy. Other approaches included psychodynamic or interpersonal therapy. Although most of these treatments are not customarily administered by primary care providers in the office, patients can be referred to behavioral health providers for them. The primary care provider can play a continued role in the care of these patients by monitoring them during the process, providing follow-up, and coordinating with other care providers.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
In addition to approaching the problem of suicide from an individual level in primary care, approaches are being implemented at community, regional, and national levels. In the health care system, laws requiring coverage parity between mental and physical health disorders will give more persons the ability to access care for psychiatric problems associated with suicide, such as depression. Efforts to coordinate care among programs that address mental health, substance use, and physical health can also increase access to care. Activities that have been shown to be correlated with lower suicide rates in other countries include detoxification of domestic gas in the United Kingdom and discontinuation of the use of highly toxic pesticides in Sri Lanka. These actions were associated with 19-33% and 50% reductions in suicide, respectively, providing evidence that engineering controls can be effective. Such activities as installing barriers at frequent suicide jump spots may also be effective.<br /><br />On an individual level, patients with a history of suicide attempt or suicidal ideation should not have easy access to means that may be used in suicide attempts, such as firearms or other weapons, household chemicals or poisons, or materials that can be used for hanging or suffocation.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The USPSTF recommends that physicians screen adolescents and adults for depression when appropriate systems are in place to ensure adequate diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up (available at <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>). <br /><br />The Community Preventive Services Task Force has related recommendations on collaborative care approaches to managing depression, mental health parity policy, and home-based depression care for older adults (available at <a href=""http://www.thecommunityguide.org/mentalhealth/index.html"">www.thecommunityguide.org/mentalhealth/index.html</a>). <br /><br />In 2012, the U.S. Surgeon General and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention released the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention, which includes goals and objectives for action (available at <a href=""http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/reports/national-strategy-suicide-prevention/full-report.pdf"">www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/reports/national-strategy-suicide-prevention/full-report.pdf</a>). <br /><br />The Suicide Prevention Resource Center, supported by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, offers various resources on suicide prevention (available at <a href=""http://www.sprc.org/"">www.sprc.org</a>).&nbsp;<br />
<h2><br />Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
More research on the epidemiology and natural history of suicide risk is needed. Persons who attempt suicide and survive and those who die by suicide are overlapping populations. Some individuals die on their first attempt and may never be seen in primary care, whereas others may repeat nonfatal attempts and never die or die after multiple attempts. More research to understand these subgroups and to determine who accesses primary care is needed. <br /><br />Several key areas need further research to improve the evidence base for screening for suicide risk in primary care. For screening to be effective, more information on the performance characteristics of screening tests, particularly in average-risk adolescents,n is needed. More information is needed to determine whether more individuals with screen-detected suicidal ideation could be helped before they act. Studies examining the benefits and potential harms of targeted versus general screening would also be helpful. The possibility of incorporating technology into large-scale screening studies should also be explored. <br /><br />Treatment studies in populations with screen-detected suicide risk in all age groups are needed. Targeting persons at high risk, such as American Indians and Hispanic persons, may help determine whether tailored therapies are more effective in these populations. It is critical that more investigations on the benefits and risks of interventions targeting average- and high-risk adolescents be conducted. Trials including interventions aimed at parents have shown some promise and should be further explored. <br /><br />It would also be valuable to replicate trials in adults that focus primarily on the process of care (including quality of care and patient adherence) rather than the specific content of treatment sessions because trials on the latter have shown moderate-sized but statistically nonsignificant effects. <br /><br />Investigating ways to link clinical and community resources might also lead to other possible methods to help patients at risk for suicide.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/suicide/suicidefinalrs.htm#consider,143,"Several groups have made recommendations or commented on screening patients for suicide risk. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry recommends that clinicians be aware of patients at high risk for suicide. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pediatricians ask questions about mood disorders, sexual orientation, suicidal thoughts, and other risk factors associated with suicide during routine health care visits. The American Medical Association states that all adolescents should be asked annually about behaviors or emotions that indicate recurrent or severe depression or risk for suicide and that physicians should screen for depression or suicidal risk in those with risk factors, such as family dysfunction, declining school grades, and history of abuse. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that all adolescents be screened annually for emotions and behaviors that indicate recurrent or severe depression and thoughts of killing or harming themselves. In addition, suicide risk and depressive symptoms are included as part of the College's annual well-woman visit evaluation and counseling recommendations for females aged 13 to 65 years or older. The American Academy of Family Physicians concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for suicide risk in adolescents, adults, and older adults in primary care. The recommendation of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care also mirrors the 2004 USPSTF recommendation in that it found poor evidence to include or exclude routine evaluation of suicide risk during a periodic health examination.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/suicide/suicidefinalrs.htm#recommendations,"<p><strong>Importance</strong> <br />Suicide was the 10th leading overall cause of death in the United States in 2010 and 1 of the 5 leading causes of death for children, adolescents, and adults aged 10 to 54 years.

58,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to children and adolescents younger than age 18 years. It does not apply to children and adolescents who have been diagnosed with a substance use disorder. All persons with a substance use disorder should receive appropriate treatment. Although this statement does not include a recommendation on screening for drug use, further information on screening tests is provided in the <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/drugmisuse/drugmisusefinalrs.htm#discussion"">Discussion</a>&nbsp;section.
<h3>Definitions</h3>
The USPSTF recognizes that various definitions have been applied to the terms <em>drug use</em>, <em>misuse</em>, and <em>abuse</em>. For the purpose of this recommendation statement, &ldquo;drug use&rdquo; encompasses the general concepts of &ldquo;illicit drug use&rdquo; and &ldquo;nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals&rdquo; (prescription and over-the-counter drugs). &ldquo;Illicit drug use&rdquo; specifies use of illegal drugs (such as cocaine and heroin) and inhalants (such as aerosols, glue, and gasoline). &ldquo;Nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals&rdquo; includes the use of prescribed medications for a purpose other than prescribed (or by a person not prescribed the medication) or the use of over-the-counter drugs for a purpose other than medically indicated. To be consistent with the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition</em>, &ldquo;substance use disorder&rdquo; is used instead of &ldquo;substance abuse&rdquo; and &ldquo;substance dependence&rdquo; unless describing previously collected study or survey results that reported findings using the terms <em>abuse</em> and <em>dependence</em>.
<h3>Behavioral Interventions</h3>
Although the evidence to recommend specific interventions in the primary care setting is insufficient, interventions that have been studied include face-to-face counseling, videos, print materials, and interactive computer-based tools. Studies on these interventions provide little to no evidence of significant improvements in health outcomes.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
In deciding whether to provide behavioral interventions to prevent or reduce illicit drug and nonmedical pharmaceutical use for children and adolescents, primary care providers should consider the following.
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
According to the NSDUH, nearly 1 in 10 American adolescents use drugs. In 2011, the Drug Abuse Warning Network estimated that more than 75,000 emergency department visits by children and adolescents involved illicit drugs, and more than 75,000 visits involved the nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals. The consequences of drug use include risk for progression to a substance use disorder, an increase in risk-taking behaviors while under the influence, and lower educational achievement and attainment. Persons who initiate marijuana use at younger ages are more likely to progress to drug abuse and dependence as adults compared with those who initiate use after age 18 years.
<h4>Costs</h4>
The costs associated with primary care&ndash;based behavioral interventions vary substantially and are similar to costs of interventions for tobacco and alcohol reduction. Health systems and providers should account for the staff time associated with any intervention, which may range from distributing educational materials to a series of office-based, 1-on-1 counseling sessions. Computer-based interactive tools linked to an adolescent's personal health record may require less ongoing staff time to administer. There are also potential costs for families, especially for interventions that require significant participation from parents as well as adolescents.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
Potential harms associated with behavioral interventions include anxiety, interference with the clinician&ndash;patient relationship, opportunity costs (that is, time spent on these interventions that could be used for other, more effective interventions), unintended increases in other risky behaviors, and even paradoxical increases in drug use or initiation. Although evidence is limited, no direct harms were identified.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
Most clinicians who care for children and adolescents in the United States do not provide behavioral interventions to reduce drug use. Given the lack of evidence of effective primary care&ndash;based interventions, this is not surprising. It is important to recognize that this recommendation does not address screening for drug use. Screening adolescents who are not suspected to be using drugs may identify some who meet criteria for a substance use disorder and for whom treatment is available. The Task Force did not find effective interventions to reduce future drug use in adolescents who have tried illicit drugs.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The USPSTF has made recommendations on screening for and interventions to decrease the unhealthy use of other substances, including alcohol and tobacco. These recommendations are available on the USPSTF Web site (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Illicit drug and nonmedical pharmaceutical use in adolescents is an important public health problem. Evidence to assess the effects of behavioral interventions in adolescents is limited, and high-quality studies that focus on the role of primary care professionals in preventing initiation of drug use and reducing use among those who have experimented are needed. Research on brief interventions; interventions that link screening with tailored interventions; and social media, cell phone, and Internet-based interventions is needed and may identify novel, effective risk-reduction strategies. Research should continue to study diverse populations and the effects of interventions on children and adolescents with different risks, as well as which interventions work best in these subpopulations. Research should continue to examine the effectiveness of behavioral interventions with and without parental involvement. Additional high-quality studies that evaluate interventions and address drug use in the context of other substances, including tobacco and alcohol, are also needed. Research to develop and validate tools to measure current and past substance use is needed. Attention should be given to the standardization of research outcomes to improve the ability of future systematic reviews to move the field forward.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/drugmisuse/drugmisusefinalrs.htm#consider,140,"The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all adolescents be screened for alcohol and drug use and that, based on the results, clinicians conduct further assessment, provide guidance and brief counseling interventions, and, if appropriate, refer for treatment.

59,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to universal screening with formal screening instruments in community-dwelling adults in the general primary care population who are older than age 65 years and have no signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment. Early detection and diagnosis of dementia through the assessment of patient-, family-, or physician-recognized signs and symptoms, some of which may be subtle, are not considered screening and are not the focus of this recommendation.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<em>Potential Preventable Burden</em> <br /><br />The prevalence of dementia in the United States is 5% in persons aged 71 to 79 years, increasing to 24% in those aged 80 to 89 years and 37% in those older than 90 years. The prevalence of older adults with MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment)&nbsp;is difficult to estimate because of differences in the definition of MCI and methods used in studies; estimates range widely, from 3% to 42% in adults age 65 years and older. Approximately 40% to 50% of older adults report subjective memory symptoms. The rate of progression of MCI to dementia is uncertain. <br /><br />Although the evidence on routine screening is insufficient, there may be important reasons to identify early cognitive impairment. In addition to its potential to help patients make diagnostic and treatment decisions, including treatment of reversible causes of dementia and management of comorbid conditions, early recognition of cognitive impairment allows clinicians to anticipate problems patients may have in understanding and adhering to recommended therapy. This information may also be useful to patients and their caregivers and family members in anticipating and planning for future problems that may develop as a result of progression of cognitive impairment. Although the overall evidence on routine screening is insufficient, clinicians should remain alert to early signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment (for example, problems with memory or language) and evaluate as appropriate. The National Institute on Aging has information on the detection and management of cognitive impairment for patients and clinicians, including a database of tools to detect cognitive impairment (available at <a href=""http://www.nia.nih.gov/"">www.nia.nih.gov</a>). <br /><br /><em>Potential Harms</em> <br /><br />Information about the harms of screening, including labeling and the effect of false-positive results, is limited. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are associated with adverse effects, some of which are serious, including central nervous system disturbances and bradycardia. Gastrointestinal symptoms are also common. Information about the harms of nonpharmacologic interventions is limited, but these harms are assumed to be small. Exercise interventions are not associated with serious adverse effects. <br /><br /><em>Costs</em> <br /><br />The cost of screening varies depending on the screening instrument. Some instruments take little time and are free to the public. The most widely studied instrument, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), takes approximately 10 minutes to administer and is not free. Total health, long-term, and hospice care costs for dementia in the United States were an estimated $183 billion in 2011. Medicare and Medicaid pay approximately 40% to 70% of these costs, representing $130 billion. These costs do not include the estimated $202 billion in uncompensated care that informal caregivers provide annually. <br /><br /><em>Current Practice<br /><br /></em>At present, diagnosis of dementia primarily occurs as a result of a clinician's suspicion of patient symptoms or caregiver concerns and not as a result of routine formal screening. As much as 29% to 76% of patients with dementia or probable dementia in the primary care setting are undiagnosed. In 2011, Medicare added detection of cognitive impairment to the new annual wellness visit benefit, and the Alzheimer's Association has published guidance on how to implement this benefit.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
Increasing age is the strongest known risk factor for cognitive impairment. The &epsilon;4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene is a reported risk factor for Alzheimer disease. Other reported risk factors for cognitive impairment include cardiovascular risk factors (such as diabetes, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and the metabolic syndrome), head trauma, learning disabilities (such as Down syndrome), depression, alcohol abuse, physical frailty, low education level, low social support, and having never been married.<br /><br />Several dietary and lifestyle factors have been associated with decreased risk for dementia; these factors have weaker supporting evidence than those previously mentioned. Adequate folic acid intake, low saturated fat intake, longer-chain &omega;-3 fatty acids, high fruit and vegetable intake, Mediterranean diet, moderate alcohol intake, educational attainment, cognitive engagement, and participation in physical activity are all associated with decreased risk for dementia.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Screening tests for cognitive impairment in the clinical setting generally include asking patients to perform a series of tasks that assess at least 1 cognitive domain (memory, attention, language, and visuospatial or executive functioning). Blood tests and radiology examinations are not currently used as screening tests but are often used after a positive screening result to confirm the diagnosis of dementia and determine its subtype. Although optimum sensitivity and specificity of the MMSE probably vary depending on the patient's age and education level, a large body of literature suggests that a general cut point of 23/24 or 24/25 (score considered &ldquo;positive&rdquo;/&ldquo;negative&rdquo;) is appropriate for most primary care populations. <br /><br />Other instruments with more limited evidence include the Clock Drawing Test, Mini-Cog Test, Memory Impairment Screen, Abbreviated Mental Test, Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, 7-Minute Screen, Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status, and Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly. Each of these tests has reasonable performance in some studies, but estimates of sensitivity and specificity vary, and the optimum diagnostic threshold or cut point for many of these instruments is unclear. For information on all instruments reviewed by the USPSTF, including the Montreal Cognitive Screening Assessment, the St. Louis University Mental Status examination, and other instruments with 2 or fewer studies, see the full evidence report (available at <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">wwww.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).
<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>
Treatment of cognitive impairment focuses on several signs and symptoms, including quality-of-life, cognition, mood, and behavioral impairments.<br /><br />Several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions aim to prevent, slow, or reverse cognitive impairment in older adults or improve caregiver burden and depression. Pharmacologic treatments approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration include AChEIs and memantine. Nonpharmacologic interventions include cognitive training, lifestyle behavioral interventions, exercise, educational interventions, and multidisciplinary care interventions. Several interventions focus on the caregiver and aim to improve caregiver morbidity and delay institutionalization of persons with dementia.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
The USPSTF has published recommendations related to several of the risk factors for cognitive impairment, including counseling on tobacco cessation, alcohol use, healthful diet, physical activity, and falls prevention and screening for high cholesterol, hypertension, and depression (available at <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">wwww.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
More research on screening for and treatment of MCI is needed. Evidence on the effect of screening and early detection of mild to moderate dementia on decision making, planning, or other important patient outcomes is a critical gap in the evidence. Given the lack of evidence that treatment affects long-term cognitive outcomes for mild to moderate dementia, its effect on decision making and planning could be the most compelling reason for screening. However, no studies provided information on this effect. More research on the harms of screening is needed. Research on new interventions that address the changing needs of patients and families and interventions that clearly have an effect on the long-term clinical course of mild to moderate dementia are also critically needed.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf14/dementia/dementiafinalrs.htm#consider,141,"In 2011, Medicare began covering the detection of cognitive impairment as a part of the new annual wellness visit benefit. In 2013, the Alzheimer's Association published guidance on the detection of cognitive impairment during the annual wellness visit and recommended an algorithm involving a health risk assessment, patient observation, and unstructured questioning. The Alzheimer's Association recommends the use of a brief structured assessment (such as the General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition, Mini-Cog Test, Memory Impairment Screen, Alzheimer Disease 8-Item Informant Interview, or the short version of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly) if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment are present or if an informant is not available to confirm the absence of signs or symptoms.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf14/dementia/dementiafinalrs.htm#recommendations,,Screening for Cognitive Impairment,"Cognitive Impairment, Screening, 2014",,,,,

<p>This recommendation applies to community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are not known to have osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency.</p>
<h3>Brief Risk Assessment</h3>
<p>When determining to whom these recommendations apply, primary care clinicians can reasonably consider a small number of risk factors to identify older adults who are at increased risk for falls. Age is strongly related to risk for falls. Studies most commonly used a history of falls to identify increased risk for future falls; history of falls is generally considered together or sequentially with other key risk factors, particularly impairments in mobility, gait, and balance. A pragmatic approach to identifying persons at high risk for falls, consistent with the enrollment criteria for intervention trials, would be to assess for a history of falls or for problems in physical functioning and limited mobility. Clinicians could also use assessments of gait and mobility, such as the Timed Up and Go test.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation5""><span style=""font-size: small;"">5-7</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Interventions</h3>
<h4>Exercise Interventions</h4>
<p>Effective exercise interventions include supervised individual and group classes and physical therapy, although most studies reviewed by the USPSTF included group exercise. Given the heterogeneity of interventions reviewed by the USPSTF, it is difficult to identify specific components of exercise that are particularly efficacious. The most common exercise component was gait, balance, and functional training (17 trials), followed by resistance training (13 trials), flexibility (8 trials), and endurance training (5 trials). Three studies included tai chi, and 5 studies included general physical activity. The most common frequency and duration for exercise interventions was 3 sessions per week for 12 months, although duration of exercise interventions ranged from 2 to 42 months.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation8""><span style=""font-size: small;"">8</span></a></sup> The 2008 US Department of Health and Human Services guidelines recommended that older adults get at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, as well as muscle-strengthening activities twice per week.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation9""><span style=""font-size: small;"">9</span></a></sup> It also recommended performing balance training on 3 or more days per week for older adults at risk for falls because of a recent fall or difficulty walking.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation9""><span style=""font-size: small;"">9</span></a></sup></p>
<h4>Multifactorial Interventions</h4>
<p>Multifactorial interventions include an initial assessment of modifiable risk factors for falls and subsequent customized interventions for each patient based on issues identified in the initial assessment. The initial assessment could include a multidisciplinary comprehensive geriatric assessment or an assessment using a combination of various components, such as balance, gait, vision, postural blood pressure, medication, environment, cognition, and psychological health. In studies, nursing staff usually performed the assessment, and a number of different professionals performed subsequent interventions, including nurses, clinicians, physical therapists, exercise instructors, occupational therapists, dieticians, or nutritionists. Intervention components vary based on the initial assessment and could include group or individual exercise, psychological interventions (cognitive behavioral therapy), nutrition therapy, education, medication management, urinary incontinence management, environmental modification, physical or occupational therapy, social or community services, and referral to specialists (eg, ophthalmologist, neurologist, or cardiologist). For additional details on multifactorial interventions reviewed by the USPSTF, please see the full evidence report.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation8""><span style=""font-size: small;"">8</span></a></sup><span style=""font-size: small;""><sup>, </sup><sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation10"">10</a></sup></span></p>
<h4>Other Interventions</h4>
<p>The following single interventions lack sufficient evidence for or against their use to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults when offered alone and not in the context of a multifactorial intervention: environmental modification, medication management, psychological interventions, and combination interventions not customized to an individual risk profile.</p>
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
<p>Fractures are an important injury associated with falls, and the USPSTF has issued 2 related recommendation statements on the prevention of fractures. The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis in women 65 years or older and in younger women at increased risk.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation11""><span style=""font-size: small;"">11</span></a></sup> In its recommendation on vitamin D and calcium supplementation to prevent fractures, the USPSTF states that it found insufficient evidence on vitamin D or calcium supplementation to prevent fractures in men, premenopausal women at any dose, and in postmenopausal women at doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D and greater than 1000 mg of calcium; the USPSTF recommends against supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D or 1000 mg or less of calcium in postmenopausal women.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation12""><span style=""font-size: small;"">12</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published guidance on implementing community-based interventions to prevent falls.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation13""><span style=""font-size: small;"">13</span></a></sup></p>",,191,"<h3>Other Considerations</h3>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Although the evidence does not support routinely performing an in-depth multifactorial risk assessment with comprehensive management in all older adults, there may be reasons for providing this service to certain patients. Important items in the patient's medical history could include the circumstances of prior falls and the presence of comorbid medical conditions. The American Geriatric Society (AGS) recommends multifactorial risk assessment with multicomponent interventions in older adults who have had 2 falls in the past year (1 fall if combined with gait or balance problems), have gait or balance problems, or present with an acute fall.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation14""><span style=""font-size: small;"">14</span></a></sup> According to the AGS, evaluation of balance and mobility, vision, and orthostatic or postural hypotension are effective components of multifactorial risk assessment with comprehensive management, as well as review of medication use and home environment.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation14""><span style=""font-size: small;"">14</span></a></sup> Follow-up and comprehensive management of identified risk factors are essential to the effectiveness of this strategy.</p>
<p>The burden of falls on patients and the health care system is large. Reducing the incidence of falls would also improve the socialization and functioning of older adults who have previously fallen and fear falling again. Many other interventions could potentially be useful to prevent falls, but because of the heterogeneity in the target patient population, heterogeneity (ie, multiplicity) of predisposing factors, and their additive or synergistic nature, the effectiveness of other interventions is not known. However, many interventions with insufficient evidence to support their use to prevent falls have other arguments that support their use.</p>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
<p>Studies are needed on the clinical validation of primary care tools to identify older adults at increased risk for falls. More efficacy trials are needed on how the following interventions may help prevent falls if offered alone and not as part of multifactorial interventions: environmental modification, medication management, and psychological interventions. Additional research is needed on the effectiveness of interventions in different age groups, in particular adults older than 85 years. Additional research to identify effective components of exercise interventions would also be useful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations of Others</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute on Aging outlines similar interventions for the prevention of falls: exercise for strength and balance, monitoring for environmental hazards, regular medical care to ensure optimized hearing and vision, and medication management.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation30""><span style=""font-size: small;"">30</span></a></sup> According to the AGS, detecting a history of falls is fundamental to a falls reduction program, and it recommends asking all older adults once a year about falls.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation14""><span style=""font-size: small;"">14</span></a></sup> The AGS further recommends that older persons who have experienced a fall should have their gait and balance assessed using one of the available evaluations; those who cannot perform or perform poorly on a standardized gait and balance test should be given a multifactorial falls risk assessment that includes a focused medical history, physical examination, functional assessment, and an environmental assessment. The AGS also recommends the following interventions for falls prevention: adaptation or modification of home environment; withdrawal or minimization of psychoactive or other medications; management of postural hypotension; management of foot problems and footwear; exercise (particularly balance), strength, and gait training; and vitamin D supplementation of at least 800 IU per day for persons with vitamin D deficiency or who are at increased risk for falls. The AGS found insufficient evidence to recommend vision screening alone as a single intervention for falls prevention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends STEADI, a coordinated approach to implementing the AGS clinical practice guidelines for falls prevention that consists of 3 core elements: screen to identify fall risk, assess modifiable risk factors, and intervene using effective clinical and community strategies to reduce the identified risk. Clinical strategies include but are not limited to physical therapy and medication management. Community strategies include but are not limited to evidence-based exercise programs and home modification.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation31""><span style=""font-size: small;"">31</span></a></sup> Similar to the 2012 USPSTF recommendation, the American Academy of Family Physicians recommends exercise or physical therapy and vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are at increased risk for falls. It does not recommend automatically performing an in-depth multifactorial risk assessment in conjunction with comprehensive management of identified risks.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation32""><span style=""font-size: small;"">32</span></a></sup></p>

<p><strong><sup><span style=""font-size: small;"">Update of Previous</span></sup></strong><sup><span style=""font-size: small;""> Recommendation</span></sup></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">The USPSTF last issued a recommendation on interventions to prevent falls in older adults in 2012. At that time, consistent with the current recommendation statement, the USPSTF recommended exercise (B recommendation) and selectively offering multifactorial interventions (C recommendation) to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults at increased risk for falls. At that time, the USPSTF also recommended vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls (B recommendation), based on previous evidence that found a reduction in the number of persons experiencing a fall. The current review excluded studies considered in the previous review that enrolled persons with vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency because, on further consideration, vitamin D supplementation in these examined additional fall-related outcomes, including incident falls (in addition to the number of persons experiencing a fall, which was considered in the previous review). With this revised scope of review, as well as newer evidence from trials reporting no benefit, the USPSTF found that vitamin D supplementation has no benefit in falls prevention in community-dwelling older adults not known to have vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. Thus, the USPSTF now recommends against vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of falls in community-dwelling older adults.</span></p>",https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1,"<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Falls are the leading cause of injury-related morbidity and mortality among older adults in the United States.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1</span></a></sup> In 2014, 28.7% of community-dwelling adults 65 years or older reported falling, resulting in 29 million falls (37.5% of which needed medical treatment or restricted activity for a day or longer)<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation2""><span style=""font-size: small;"">2</span></a></sup> and an estimated 33,000 deaths in 2015.<sup><a href=""https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/falls-prevention-in-older-adults-interventions1#citation1""><span style=""font-size: small;"">1-4</span></a></sup></p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>Effective primary care interventions to prevent falls use various approaches to identify persons at increased risk. However, no instrument has been clearly identified as accurate and feasible for identifying older adults at increased risk for falls. Although many studies used a variety of risk factors functional tests, or both involving gait, balance, or mobility to identify study participants, history of falls was the most commonly used factor that consistently identified persons at high risk for falls.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Early Intervention</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that exercise interventions have a moderate benefit in preventing falls in older adults at increased risk for falls. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that multifactorial interventions have a small benefit in preventing falls in older adults at increased risk for falls. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that vitamin D supplementation has no benefit in preventing falls in older adults.</p>
<h3>Harms of Early Intervention</h3>
<p>Based on the noninvasive nature of most of the interventions, the low likelihood of serious harms, and the available information from studies reporting few serious harms, the USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the harms of exercise and multifactorial interventions as no greater than small. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the overall harms of vitamin D supplementation are small to moderate; evidence suggests that the harms of vitamin D supplementation at very high dosages may be moderate.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that exercise interventions provide a moderate net benefit in preventing falls in older adults at increased risk for falls.</p>

61,"There are no validated methods of identifying women at high risk for preeclampsia on the basis of biomarkers, clinical diagnostic tests, or medical history. Most clinicians use medical history to identify women at high risk. Risk factors, based on medical history, may help guide clinicians and their patients in the decision to begin aspirin use. <br /><br />Although clinical risk assessments were not systematically reviewed for this recommendation, a pragmatic approach is described in the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/low-dose-aspirin-use-for-the-prevention-of-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preeclampsia-preventive-medication#tab"">Table</a>. This approach may help to identify a patient population with an absolute risk for preeclampsia of at least 8%, which is consistent with the lowest preeclampsia incidence observed in control groups in studies reviewed by the USPSTF. Women with 1 or more high-risk factors should receive low-dose aspirin. Women with several moderate-risk factors may also benefit from low-dose aspirin (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/low-dose-aspirin-use-for-the-prevention-of-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preeclampsia-preventive-medication#tab"">Table</a>), but the evidence is less certain for this approach.

*Includes only risk factors that can be obtained from the patient medical history. Clinical measures, such as uterine artery Doppler ultrasonography, are not included.<br />&dagger;Single risk factors that are consistently associated with the greatest risk for preeclampsia. The preeclampsia incidence rate would be approximately &ge;8% in a pregnant woman with &ge;1 of these risk factors.<br />&Dagger; A combination of multiple moderate-risk factors may be used by clinicians to identify women at high risk for preeclampsia. These risk factors are independently associated with moderate risk for preeclampsia, some more consistently than others.<br />&sect; Moderate-risk factors vary in their association with increased risk for preeclampsia.
<h3>Assessment of Risk for Adverse Effects</h3>
Low-dose aspirin use in women at increased risk for preeclampsia has not been shown to increase the occurrence of placental abruption; postpartum hemorrhage; or fetal harms, such as intracranial bleeding and congenital anomalies.
<h3>Use of Preventive Medication</h3>
The dosage and timing of initiation of low-dose aspirin varied across studies. However, the beneficial effects and small harms of low-dose aspirin were consistent across dosages and timing of initiation. It was not possible to determine from the evidence whether a specific dosage or timing of aspirin use conferred greater benefit over other dosages or intervals.
<h4>Dosage</h4>
Low-dose aspirin at dosages between 60 and 150 mg/d reduced the occurrence of preeclampsia, preterm birth, and IUGR in women at increased risk for preeclampsia in several randomized trials. The most commonly used dosage was 100 mg/d, but the 2 largest trials contributing to the estimates of benefit used 60 mg/d. Although studies did not evaluate a dosage of 81 mg/d, low-dose aspirin is available in the United States as 81-mg tablets, which is a reasonable dosage for prophylaxis in women at high risk for preeclampsia.
<h4>Timing</h4>
Use of low-dose aspirin was initiated between 12 and 28 weeks of gestation. Evidence did not suggest additional benefit when use of aspirin was started earlier (12 to 16 weeks) rather than later (&ge;16 weeks) in pregnancy in women at increased risk for preeclampsia.<br /><br />
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Research is needed on the effect of low-dose aspirin on the development of preeclampsia and how the magnitude of response to low-dose aspirin varies with individual or combined risk factors for preeclampsia. Research on how to improve clinicians' ability to identify women at increased risk for preeclampsia, particularly those who would receive the greatest benefit from aspirin as preventive medication, is also needed. Efforts to validate the effectiveness of risk assessment tools using clinical history alone or combined with clinical testing may help clinicians better identify high-risk women who will benefit from aspirin as preventive medication, and help reduce the incidence of preeclampsia and its consequent outcomes. <br /><br />Further research in populations that bear the highest disease burden for preeclampsia, including African American and nulliparous women, is needed. Multivariable risk prediction models that identify healthy nulliparous women who are likely to develop preeclampsia are in development, but further refinement and validation are needed. Additional research to further assess preeclampsia risk in pregnant women with 1 or more moderate-risk factors is needed. Future trials should recruit adequate numbers of women from racial/ethnic populations that are at disproportionate risk, such as African American women, in order to have sufficient power to determine the effectiveness of different aspirin dosages and timing of initiation in these high-risk groups. <br /><br />Larger studies investigating aspirin use in the first or early second trimester may improve the evidence base on optimal timing of low-dose aspirin as preventive medication. Other areas of research include optimal therapies that individualize the aspirin dosage and timing of administration (e.g., morning vs. bedtime). <br /><br />In addition, studies that explore less well-established risk factors that may better identify women at high risk for preeclampsia are needed. Further research should also investigate whether preeclampsia prevention with low-dose aspirin affects women's long-term risk for cardiovascular disease and whether there are benefits to continuing low-dose aspirin after delivery in women with 1 or more high-risk factors.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
The USPSTF recommends that all women planning or capable of pregnancy take a daily supplement containing 0.4 to 0.8 mg (400 to 800 &micro;g) of folic acid. More information is available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/low-dose-aspirin-use-for-the-prevention-of-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preeclampsia-preventive-medication,148,"The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends initiating use of low-dose aspirin (60 to 80 mg/d) during the late first trimester to prevent preeclampsia in women with a medical history of early-onset preeclampsia and preterm delivery (&lt;34 weeks) or history of preeclampsia in more than 1 previous pregnancy. <br /><br />The World Health Organization recommends the use of low-dose aspirin (75 mg/d) starting as early as 12 to 20 weeks of gestation for high-risk women (i.e., those with a history of preeclampsia, diabetes, chronic hypertension, renal or autoimmune disease, or multifetal pregnancies). It states that there is limited evidence regarding the benefits of low-dose aspirin in other subgroups of high-risk women. <br /><br />The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends that women at high risk for preeclampsia (i.e., women with a history of hypertension in a previous pregnancy, chronic kidney disease, autoimmune disease, type 1 or 2 diabetes, or chronic hypertension) take 75 mg/d of aspirin from 12 weeks until delivery. It recommends the same for women with more than 1 moderate-risk factor (first pregnancy, age &ge;40 years, pregnancy interval &gt;10 years, body mass index &ge;35 kg/m2, family history of preeclampsia, or multifetal pregnancies).<br /><br />The American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association recommend that women with chronic primary or secondary hypertension or previous pregnancy-related hypertension take low-dose aspirin from 12 weeks until delivery. <br /><br />The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) after 12 weeks of gestation in women who are at high risk for preeclampsia.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/low-dose-aspirin-use-for-the-prevention-of-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preeclampsia-preventive-medication,,Low-Dose Aspirin Use for the Prevention of Morbidity and Mortality From Preeclampsia,"Aspirin Use for Prevention of Morbidity and Mortality from Preeclampsia: Preventive Medication, 2014",,,,,
62,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to all sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant women.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
Age is a strong predictor of risk for chlamydial and gonococcal infections, with the highest infection rates occurring in women aged 20 to 24 years, followed by females aged 15 to 19 years. Chlamydial infections are 10 times more prevalent than gonococcal infections in young adult women. Among men, infection rates are highest in those aged 20 to 24 years. <br /><br />Other risk factors for infection include having a new sex partner, more than 1 sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI; inconsistent condom use among persons who are not in mutually monogamous relationships; previous or coexisting STI; and exchanging sex for money or drugs. Prevalence is also higher among incarcerated populations, military recruits, and patients receiving care at public STI clinics. There are also racial and ethnic differences in STI prevalence. In 2012, black and Hispanic persons had higher rates of infection than white persons. Clinicians should consider the communities they serve and may want to consult local public health authorities for guidance on identifying groups that are at increased risk. Gonococcal infection, in particular, is concentrated in specific geographic locations and communities.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
<em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>&nbsp;infections should be diagnosed by using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) because their sensitivity and specificity are high and they are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use on urogenital sites, including male and female urine, as well as clinician-collected endocervical, vaginal, and male urethral specimens. Most NAATs that are approved for use on vaginal swabs are also approved for use on self-collected vaginal specimens in clinical settings. Rectal and pharyngeal swabs can be collected from persons who engage in receptive anal intercourse and oral sex, although these collection sites have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Urine testing with NAATs is at least as sensitive as testing with endocervical specimens, clinician- or self-collected vaginal specimens, or urethral specimens that are self-collected in clinical settings. The same specimen can be used to test for chlamydia and gonorrhea.
<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>
In the absence of studies on screening intervals, a reasonable approach would be to screen patients whose sexual history reveals new or persistent risk factors since the last negative test result.
<h3>Treatment and Interventions</h3>
Chlamydial and gonococcal infections respond to treatment with antibiotics. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and expedited partner therapy are available at &nbsp;<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/default.htm"" target=""_blank"">www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/default.htm</a>&nbsp; and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/std/ept/default.htm"" target=""_blank"">www.cdc.gov/std/ept/default.htm</a>, respectively. <br /><br />Posttest counseling is an integral part of management of patients with a newly diagnosed STI. The USPSTF recommends offering or referral to high-intensity behavioral counseling for patients with current or recent STIs (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsstds.htm"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsstds.htm</a>). Posttest counseling can also serve as an educational opportunity for patients who present with STI concerns but test negative for infection. It should address safe sex practices that can reduce disease transmission or reinfection; motivational interviewing strategies may also promote risk-reducing behaviors.<br /><br />To maximize adherence, the CDC recommends that drug treatment be dispensed on site. The CDC recommends that all sex partners of infected patients from the preceding 60 days be evaluated, tested, and treated for infection. It also recommends that infected patients be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until after they and their sex partners have completed treatment and no longer have symptoms. For a sex partner who cannot be linked to care, the CDC suggests that clinicians consider expedited partner therapy, which allows for the delivery of a drug or drug prescription to the partner by the patient, a disease investigation specialist, or a pharmacy. Because of a high likelihood of reinfection, the CDC also recommends retesting all patients diagnosed with chlamydial or gonococcal infection 3 months after treatment, regardless of whether they believe their partners have been treated.<br /><br />In pregnant women, a test of cure to document eradication of chlamydial infection 3 weeks after treatment is recommended. Pregnant women diagnosed with a chlamydial or gonococcal infection in the first trimester should be retested 3 months after treatment. Gonococcal neonatal ophthalmia, which can be transmitted from an untreated woman to her newborn, may be prevented with routine topical prophylaxis at delivery. However, prevention of chlamydial neonatal pneumonia and ophthalmia requires prenatal detection and treatment.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
Chlamydial and gonococcal infections are often asymptomatic in men but may result in urethritis, epididymitis, and proctitis. Uncommon complications include reactive arthritis (chlamydia) and disseminated gonococcal infection. Infections at extragenital sites (such as the pharynx and rectum) are typically asymptomatic. Chlamydial and gonococcal infections may facilitate HIV transmission in men and women. Median prevalence rates among men who have sex with men who were tested in STD Surveillance Network clinics in 2012 were 16% for gonorrhea and 12% for chlamydia.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
Potential harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea include false-positive or false-negative results as well as labeling and anxiety associated with positive results.
<h4>Costs</h4>
According to the CDC, STIs in the United States are associated with an annual cost of almost $16 billion. Among nonviral STIs, chlamydia is the most costly, with total associated costs of $516.7 million (range, $258.3 to $775.0 million). Gonococcal infections are associated with total costs of $162.1 million (range, $81.1 to $243.2 million). <br /><br />In 2008, estimated direct lifetime costs (in 2010 U.S. dollars) per case of chlamydial infection were $30 (range, $15 to $45) in men and $364 (range, $182 to $546) in women. Similarly, gonococcal infections were associated with direct costs of $79 (range, $40 to $119) in men and $354 (range, $182 to $546) in women.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
A review of health care claims of 4296 male and female patients presenting for general medical or gynecologic examinations from 2000 to 2003 found that a large proportion of those with high-risk sexual behaviors did not receive STI or HIV testing during their visit. According to a review of diagnostic billing codes for patients with high-risk sexual behaviors, men were significantly less likely than women to be tested for chlamydia (20.7% vs. 56.9%) and gonorrhea (20.7% vs. 50.9%), although they were more likely to be tested for HIV (79.3% vs. 38.8%) and syphilis (39.1% vs. 27.6%).
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
The USPSTF has issued recommendations on screening for other STIs, including hepatitis B, genital herpes, HIV, and syphilis. The USPSTF has also issued recommendations on behavioral counseling for all sexually active adolescents and for adults who are at increased risk for STIs. These recommendations are available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>.

<h3>Other Considerations</h3>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
Although the prevalence of chlamydia and gonorrhea differs, the risk factors for infection overlap and the USPSTF recommends screening for both simultaneously.
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Studies evaluating the effectiveness of different screening strategies for identifying persons who are at increased risk for infection, cotesting for concurrent STIs, and different screening intervals are needed to inform practice guidelines. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of screening asymptomatic men to reduce the consequences of infection and transmission to sexual partners are needed. Identification of subgroups for whom screening may be effective is a high priority. Possible subgroups include men who have sex with men, sexually active males younger than 24 years, and men residing in high-prevalence communities. Currently, no studies provide data about the potential adverse effects of screening in any population.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chlamydia-and-gonorrhea-screening#Pod5,149,"The CDC recommends annual screening for chlamydia in all sexually active females aged 25 years or younger and in older women with specific risk factors (for example, those who have new or multiple sex partners and those reporting that their sex partner may have a concurrent sex partner), as well as screening for gonorrhea in sexually active females who are at increased risk for infection (such as those aged &lt;25 years). The CDC does not recommend routine screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in the general population. It recommends that clinicians consider screening for chlamydia in sexually active young men in high-prevalence settings. The CDC recommends annual screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men who have sex with men, based on exposure history, with more frequent screening in populations at highest risk. <br /><br />The CDC recommends screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea upon intake in juvenile detention or jail facilities in females aged 35 years or younger. It also recommends screening for gonorrhea in high-risk pregnant women and for chlamydia in all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit. The CDC recommends retesting in the third trimester in pregnant women with continued risk for infection and in those who test positive at their first prenatal visit. <br /><br />Because of the high likelihood of reinfection, the CDC also recommends retesting all patients diagnosed with chlamydial or gonococcal infections 3 months after treatment, regardless of whether they believe their partners have been treated. <br /><br />The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in sexually active females aged 25 years or younger. It also recommends screening for chlamydia in women older than 25 years who have risk factors (such as new or multiple sex partners) and for gonorrhea in asymptomatic women who are at high risk for infection (such as those with a previous gonococcal infection, other STIs, or new or multiple sex partners, as well as inconsistent condom use, commercial sex work, or illicit drug use). <br /><br />The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends routine annual screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in all sexually active females aged 25 years or younger. It recommends routine annual screening for rectal and urethral chlamydia in sexually active adolescent and young adult males who have sex with males if they engage in receptive anal or insertive intercourse, respectively, and routine annual screening for pharyngeal, rectal, and urethral gonorrhea if they engage in receptive oral, anal, or insertive intercourse, respectively. It recommends screening every 3 to 6 months for persons in this population if they are at high risk (for example, if they have multiple or anonymous partners, sex in conjunction with illicit drug use, or sex partners who participate in these activities). It also recommends screening adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to chlamydia or gonorrhea in the past 60 days from an infected partner. Clinicians should consider annual screening for chlamydia in sexually active males in settings with high prevalence rates, such as jail or juvenile correction facilities, national job training programs, STD clinics, high school clinics, and adolescent clinics (for patients who have a history of multiple partners). Clinicians should consider annual screening for gonorrhea in other sexually active and young adult males on the basis of individual and population-based risk factors. <br /><br />The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in sexually active females aged 24 years or younger and in older women who are at increased risk for infection. It concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men. <br /><br />Canadian guidelines recommend screening for chlamydia in all sexually active males and females younger than 25 years and retesting at 6 months after treatment in infected patients. They also recommend screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea at the first prenatal visit and again during the third trimester in pregnant women who test positive or are at increased risk for infection.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chlamydia-and-gonorrhea-screening#Pod9,"<div>
<h3>Importance</h3>
Chlamydia and gonorrhea are the most commonly reported sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the United States. In 2012, more than 1.4 million cases of chlamydia and more than 330,000 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Chlamydial infections are 10 times more prevalent than gonococcal infections (4.7% vs. 0.4%) in women aged 18 to 26 years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Although most identified cases are reported, the incidence of chlamydia and gonorrhea is difficult to estimate because most infections are asymptomatic and are therefore never diagnosed. The CDC estimates that more than 800,000 persons are infected with gonorrhea in the United States each year, and fewer than half of these infections are diagnosed and reported.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Chlamydial and gonococcal infections are often asymptomatic in women; however, asymptomatic infection may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and its associated complications, such as ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and chronic pelvic pain. Newborns of women with untreated infection may develop neonatal chlamydial pneumonia or gonococcal or chlamydial ophthalmia. Infection may lead to symptomatic urethritis and epididymitis in men, although gonorrhea is more likely than chlamydia to be symptomatic in men compared with women. Both types of infection may facilitate HIV transmission
<h3>Detection</h3>
The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening tests can accurately detect chlamydia. The USPSTF also found convincing evidence that screening tests can accurately detect gonorrhea.
<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</h3>
The USPSTF found adequate direct evidence that screening reduces complications of chlamydial infection in women who are at increased risk, with a moderate magnitude of benefit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for gonorrhea results in a moderate magnitude of benefit based on the large proportion of cases that are asymptomatic, the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment to reduce infections, and the high morbidity associated with untreated infections.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea reduces complications of infection and transmission or acquisition of either disease or HIV in men. The magnitude of benefit is unknown.
<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Intervention or Treatment</h3>
The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea are small to none.
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for chlamydia is associated with moderate net benefit in all sexually active women aged 24 years or younger and in older women who are at increased risk for infection.</div>

63,"<h3>Patient Population</h3>
This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults aged 50 years or older. It does not apply to persons seeking evaluation for perceived hearing problems or for cognitive or affective symptoms that may be related to hearing loss. These persons should be assessed for objective hearing impairment and treated when indicated.
<h3>Risk Assessment</h3>
Aging is the most important risk factor for hearing loss. Presbycusis, a gradual, progressive decline in the ability to perceive high-frequency tones due to degeneration of hair cells in the ear, is the most common cause of hearing loss in older adults. However, hearing loss may result from several contributing factors. Other risk factors include a history of exposure to loud noises or ototoxic agents, including occupational exposures; previous recurring inner ear infections; genetic factors; and certain systemic diseases, such as diabetes.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Available screening tests include physical diagnostic tests, such as the whispered voice, finger rub, and watch tick tests (bearing in mind that many modern watches no longer audibly tick); single-question screening or longer patient questionnaires; and handheld audiometers. All are relatively accurate and reliable screening tools for identifying adults with objective hearing loss. In addition, self-administered questionnaires, such as HHIE-S, can identify adults with perceived (or subjective) hearing difficulty. Not all adults with perceived hearing difficulty have objective hearing loss.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
Before a person receives a hearing aid, diagnosis of objective hearing loss should be confirmed with a pure-tone audiogram. Fair evidence from studies in highly selected populations shows that hearing aids can improve self-reported hearing, communication, and social functioning for some adults with age-related hearing loss.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding I Statement</h3>
<em>Potential preventable burden.</em> Finding objective hearing loss indicates eligibility for a hearing aid but does not convincingly identify persons who will find the devices helpful and wearable and will use them. One subgroup analysis of a randomized, controlled trial found that in older adults who did not have self-perceived hearing loss at study entry, screening and receipt of a free hearing aid did not increase use after 1 year compared with an unscreened control group (and overall use was low, at 0% to 1.6%). However, health-related quality of life is improved for some adults with moderate to severe hearing loss who use hearing aids compared with those who do not. <em>Cost.</em>The cost of screening varies according to the test. The cost of a questionnaire consists of the time required of both the patient and clinician. In-office clinical techniques (whispered voice, finger rub, or watch tick tests) and audiometry are quick to perform; however, handheld audiometers have up-front equipment costs. Diagnostic confirmation of a positive screen is typically done with a pure-tone audiogram, which requires a soundproof booth and trained personnel to administer the test and takes approximately 1 hour to complete. The cost of a hearing aid is a barrier to use for many older adults because it is not covered by Medicare and many private insurance companies.
<h3>Other Considerations</h3>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Future studies should concentrate on patients older than 70 years and examine whether there are differential effects of treatment on outcomes at different ages (for example, older than 70 or 80 years). Adequately powered studies are needed to better evaluate the effect of screening for hearing loss on health outcomes, such as emotional and social functioning, communication ability, and cognitive function, rather than intermediate measures, such as hearing aid use or satisfaction, particularly among adults without self-perceived or established hearing loss at baseline. The incremental benefits and costs of screening asymptomatic adults compared with only testing and treating those who seek treatment of perceived hearing impairment are unknown. Knowledge of specific factors or patient characteristics associated with increased and sustained use of hearing aids, once prescribed, could permit testing and treatment targeted to those most likely to benefit.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf11/adulthearing/adulthearrs.htm#clinical,120,The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association recommends that adults be screened once per decade and every 3 years after age 50 years. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that female patients aged 13 years or older be evaluated and counseled on hearing as part of the periodic health assessment. The American Academy of Family Physicians is in the process of updating its recommendation.,http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf11/adulthearing/adulthearrs.htm#recommendations,,Hearing Loss in Older Adults,"Hearing Loss in Older Adults, Screening, August 2012",,,,,
64,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
These recommendations apply to asymptomatic women of reproductive age and elderly and vulnerable adults. Reproductive age is defined across studies as ranging from 14 to 46 years, with most research focusing on women age 18 years or older. The term &ldquo;intimate partner violence&rdquo; describes physical, sexual, or psychological harm by a current or former partner or spouse. This type of violence can occur among heterosexual or same-sex couples and does not require sexual intimacy. A vulnerable adult is a person age 18 years or older whose ability to perform the normal activities of daily living or to provide for his or her own care or protection is impaired because of a mental, emotional, long-term physical, or developmental disability or dysfunction or brain damage. Definitions vary by state, and sometimes include the receipt of personal care services from others. Types of abuse that apply to elderly and vulnerable adults include physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional or psychological abuse, neglect, abandonment, financial or material exploitation, and self-neglect.Child abuse and neglect is addressed in a separate recommendation.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
Although all women are at potential risk for abuse, factors that elevate risk include young age, substance abuse, marital difficulties, and economic hardships.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Several screening instruments can be used to screen women for IPV. Those with the highest levels of sensitivity and specificity for identifying IPV are Hurt, Insult, Threaten, Scream (HITS) (English and Spanish versions); Ongoing Abuse Screen/Ongoing Violence Assessment Tool (OAS/OVAT); Slapped, Threatened, and Throw (STaT); Humiliation, Afraid, Rape, Kick (HARK); Modified Childhood Trauma Questionnaire&ndash;Short Form (CTQ-SF); and Woman Abuse Screen Tool (WAST).The HITS instrument includes 4 questions, can be used in a primary care setting, and is available in both English and Spanish. It can be self- or clinician-administered. HARK is a self-administered 4-item instrument. STaT is a 3-item self-report instrument that was tested in an emergency department setting.The USPSTF found no valid, reliable screening tools to identify abuse of elderly or vulnerable adults in the primary care setting.
<h3>Screening Interval</h3>
The USPSTF found no evidence on appropriate intervals for screening.
<h3>Interventions</h3>
Evidence from randomized trials support a variety of interventions for women of childbearing age, including counseling, home visits, information cards, referrals to community services, and mentoring support. Depending on the type of intervention, these services may be provided by clinicians, nurses, social workers, nonclinician mentors, or community workers. Counseling generally includes information on safety behaviors and community resources. In addition to counseling, home visits may include emotional support, education on problem-solving strategies, and parenting support. One study used a 20-minute nurse case management protocol focusing on a safety plan, supportive care, and guided referrals. No intervention studies were identified for elderly or vulnerable adults. See the following discussion for suggestions for practice in this population.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement for Elderly or Vulnerable Adults</h3>
<em>Potential benefits.</em> The estimated prevalence of elder abuse ranges from 2% to 10% based on a variety of different definitions, methods, and sampling strategies. One study indicated that 1 in 10 elderly adults may experience abuse, but only 1 in 5 or fewer cases are actually reported.  <em>Potential harms.</em> Although there is no direct evidence, the existing evidence about the lack of harms resulting from IPV screening suggests that the harms of screening elderly and vulnerable adults might also be small. Some potential harms of screening include shame, guilt, self-blame, fear of retaliation or abandonment by perpetrators, and the repercussions of false-positive results.  <em>Costs.</em> There is no evidence about the costs of screening for or interventions to reduce elder abuse. <em>Current practice.</em>Screening practices for elder abuse are limited for many reasons. Currently, there are no standards about how clinicians should ask elderly patients about possible abuse. In addition, there are varying definitions of abuse, a wide variety of mechanisms of elder abuse, no universal screening tools, wide-ranging risk factors, unclear guidance about whom to screen and what to do if abuse is identified, physician discomfort with screening, and time constraints. Screening is not done routinely and varies by locality. However, all providers should be aware of the laws in their states for reporting suspected abuse. Not all states mandate reporting, and some provide clear guidance about what type of injuries should arouse suspicion.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The USPSTF has several recommendations that may be relevant, including screening for depression&nbsp;and alcohol misuse (update in progress). Other useful resources include Web sites that contain materials useful to primary care providers. Providers often need guidance on how to address concerns about IPV with sensitivity and clarity and how to screen for IPV and provide follow-up care. Intimate partner violence introduces significant safety issues that compel a provider to be fully informed on such aspects as sensitivity. Providers also need easy access to available tools, specific guidelines, and other related materials to help them develop a clinical environment dedicated to the safety of their patients. Guidance is also available on how providers can work with local community-based domestic violence programs to receive training, information, and other resources to ensure effective management of patients who are victims of IPV. Providers should also be aware of their state and local reporting requirements. The laws vary from one jurisdiction to another, with differences in definitions, whom and what should be reported, who should report, and to whom. Although reporting suspected elder and child abuse is mandated in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, this is not the case with IPV. In addition, providers also need to be familiar with requirements in the privacy regulations of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which require that patients be advised on health information use and disclosure practices. Again, state laws around privacy issues or concerns vary. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has resources available for those needing additional information at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/intimatepartnerviolence/resources.html"">http://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/intimatepartnerviolence/resources.html</a>.
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Evidence on the use of newer screening approaches would be useful. Computerized screening and intervention increase rates of domestic violence discussion, disclosure, and service provision. Furthermore, computerized screening has been found to be more acceptable for patients. Patients perceive use of an audio questionnaire as more private and less likely to increase risk for abuse. Further evaluation of the accuracy, efficiency, and acceptability of these methods is needed.  Studies of the diagnostic accuracy of screening instruments are limited by the lack of accepted reference standards. Further development or validation of an accepted standard would allow more accurate assessment of performance measures and allow instruments to be more readily compared with each other. The broad and inconsistent definitions of abuse pose challenges for creating screening instruments, especially for detecting abuse and neglect in elderly and vulnerable populations. Although there are significant challenges in this research field, additional studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of different postscreening interventions. For the elderly and vulnerable adult populations, good-quality randomized, controlled trials focusing on both screening and interventions are needed. Because many elderly and vulnerable adults may not have sufficient physical, mental, or financial abilities to engage in screening functions, instruments need to be framed around third-party responses. Other challenges to research in this population include legal requirements related to disclosure, underlying medical conditions, and dependence on the perpetrators. It is important to note that this includes patients who have dementia or other cognitive deficiencies, as well as those with developmental disabilities. The USPSTF recognizes that these patients are particularly vulnerable to abuse because most live in a care-taking environment. Another important gap recognized by the USPSTF is the absence of evidence of effective interventions for middle-aged women who are past childbearing age but not yet elderly. Similar to the research needs for elderly and vulnerable adult populations, research is also needed to inform practice for this group of women. In addition, the USPSTF recognizes that a significant body of evidence is lacking for other populations, especially men. The CDC has conducted studies demonstrating the prevalence and importance of IPV against men perpetrated by women and other men. Research is needed in all areas related to screening and treatment in men, as well as reporting, safety, community linkages and supports, legal ramifications, and cultural aspects.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/ipvelder/ipvelderfinalrs.htm#consider,124,"The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that physicians screen all women for IPV. For women who are not pregnant, screening should occur at routine obstetric&ndash;gynecology visits, family planning visits, and preconception visits. For women who are pregnant, screening should occur over the course of the pregnancy, including at the first prenatal visit, at least once per trimester, and at the postpartum checkup. The American Medical Association states that physicians should routinely inquire about physical, sexual, and psychological abuse as part of the medical history. Physicians should also consider abuse as a factor in the presentation of medical complaints because patients' experiences with interpersonal violence or abuse may adversely affect their health status or ability to adhere to medical recommendations. Other organizations, such as the American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of Emergency Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, and Emergency Nurses Association, all have statements encouraging clinicians to be especially aware of the dynamics of family violence and the risk factors commonly found with those experiencing IPV. Further, clinicians should be prepared to respond appropriately and refer patients to available community resources where possible. In addition to recommendations for screening for IPV in all patients, some groups have specific, targeted opinion statements on screening for all forms of abuse, including screening all elderly patients for abusive or violent treatment by family, caretakers, or others. The American Medical Association and the American Academy of Neurology both have specific position statements on screening elderly patients for abuse.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/ipvelder/ipvelderfinalrs.htm#recommendations,,Screening for Intimate Partner Violence & Abuse of Elderly & Vulnerable Adults,"Intimate Partner Violence & Abuse of Elderly & Vulnerable Adults, Screening, 2012",,,,,
65,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults and adolescents who are at increased risk for syphilis infection. Screening for syphilis in nonpregnant populations is an important public health approach to preventing the sexual transmission of syphilis and subsequent vertical transmission of congenital syphilis.</p>
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
<p>The USPSTF recommends screening for syphilis in persons who are at increased risk for infection. Based on 2014 surveillance data,<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;men who have sex with men (MSM) and men and women living with HIV have the highest risk for syphilis infection; 61.1% of cases of primary and secondary syphilis occurred among MSM, and approximately one-half of all MSM diagnosed with syphilis were also coinfected with HIV. One study found that rates of syphilis coinfection were 5 times higher in MSM living with HIV compared with men living with HIV who do not have sex with men.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation4"">4</a>&nbsp;Based on older study data from northern California, the adjusted relative risk for syphilis infection in persons living with HIV (vs those without HIV) was 86.0 (95% CI, 78.6 to 94.1); 97% of those living with HIV and with incident syphilis were male.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation5"">5</a>When deciding which other persons to screen for syphilis, clinicians should be aware of the prevalence of infection in the communities they serve, as well as other sociodemographic factors that may be associated with increased risk of syphilis infection. Factors associated with increased prevalence that clinicians should consider include history of incarceration, history of commercial sex work, certain racial/ethnic groups, and being a male younger than 29 years, as well as regional variations that are well described. Men accounted for 90.8% of all cases of primary and secondary syphilis in 2014. Men aged 20 to 29 years had the highest prevalence rate, nearly 3 times higher than that in the average US male population.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;Syphilis prevalence rates are also higher in certain racial/ethnic groups (among both men and women); in 2014, prevalence rates of primary and secondary syphilis were 18.9 cases per 100,000 black individuals, 7.6 cases per 100,000 Hispanic individuals, 7.6 cases per 100,000 American Indian/Alaska Native individuals, 6.5 cases per 100,000 Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander individuals, 3.5 cases per 100,000 white individuals, and 2.8 cases per 100,000 Asian individuals.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;The southern United States comprises the largest proportion of syphilis cases (41%); however, the case rate is currently highest in the western United States (7.9 cases per 100,000 persons). Metropolitan areas in general have increased prevalence rates of syphilis.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;Risk factors for syphilis often do not present independently and may frequently overlap. In addition, local prevalence rates may change over time, so clinicians should be aware of the latest data and trends for their specific population and geographic area.Although direct evidence on screening among nonpregnant persons who are not at increased risk for syphilis infection is lacking, based on the established test performance characteristics of current screening tests and the low prevalence rate of syphilis in this population, the yield of screening is likely low. Therefore, screening in this population may result in high false-positive rates and overtreatment.</p>
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
<p>Current screening tests for syphilis rely on detection of antibodies rather than direct detection of the organism. Screening for syphilis infection is a 2-step process involving an initial nontreponemal test (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] or rapid plasma reagin [RPR] test) followed by a confirmatory treponemal antibody detection test (fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption [FTA-ABS] or&nbsp;<em>Treponema pallidum</em>particle agglutination [TPPA] test). A reverse sequence screening algorithm has been developed in which an automated treponemal test (such as enzyme-linked, chemiluminescence, or multiplex flow immunoassays) is performed first, followed by a nontreponemal test. If the test results are discordant in the reverse sequence algorithm, a second treponemal test (preferably using a different treponemal antibody) is performed.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation6"">6</a>There is limited evidence on the accuracy of screening using the reverse sequence algorithm. Findings from 2 studies suggest that using a reverse sequence algorithm may detect additional cases of syphilis missed by the usual algorithm.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation7"">7</a>&nbsp;However, the clinical significance of these additional cases is unclear, and more studies are needed to better understand the implications of using a reverse sequence algorithm for screening in a primary care setting. Newer screening technologies that include rapid syphilis tests are also currently emerging. These tests have the potential to be performed in nontraditional and nonclinical settings; however, more evidence is needed on the effectiveness of these tests as part of a screening program in a primary care setting.</p>
<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>
<p>The optimal screening frequency for persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection is not well established. Men who have sex with men or persons living with HIV may benefit from more frequent screening. Initial studies suggest that detection of syphilis infection in MSM or persons living with HIV improves when screening is performed every 3 months compared with annually.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation7"">7</a></p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>In its 2015 guidelines on the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends parenteral penicillin G benzathine for the treatment of syphilis. Dosage and route may vary depending on the stage of disease and patient characteristics. To obtain the most up-to-date information, clinicians are encouraged to access the CDC website.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation8"">8</a></p>
<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>
<p>Public health agencies and local health departments have a critical role in the prevention and treatment of syphilis. Local health departments are often responsible for investigating incident cases of syphilis and identifying potential contacts who may need further testing or treatment. Primary care clinicians should be aware of applicable local public health laws and reporting requirements for syphilis cases.</p>
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
<p>Persons who are at risk for or have been diagnosed with syphilis infection may engage in behavior that increases their risk for other sexually transmitted infections. The USPSTF has made a separate recommendation on screening for syphilis in pregnant women, as well as screening for HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia in sexually active adolescents and adults and behavioral counseling interventions to prevent sexually transmitted infections (available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).</p>",,169,"<h2>Other Considerations</h2>

<p>Although testing for syphilis in persons living with HIV may be part of HIV management care provided in a specialty setting, screening for syphilis is often conducted in primary care settings, and primary care clinicians are encouraged to routinely screen their patients who are living with HIV.</p>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
<p>Studies are needed that directly evaluate the effectiveness of screening for syphilis on related morbidity and mortality in other high-risk populations, in addition to MSM and persons living with HIV, as well as studies that help identify optimal screening intervals. Studies in adolescent populations are particularly needed. In addition, studies that evaluate the effectiveness of risk assessment instruments or other methods to identify persons who are at increased risk and who may benefit from screening are needed. Further, studies on the diagnostic accuracy of reverse sequence screening algorithms in well-defined patient populations are needed, as well as studies on the interpretation and management of discrepant serology results (such as a positive automated treponemal test, negative nontreponemal test, and positive second treponemal test).</p>
<h2>Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendations</h2>
<p>This recommendation is consistent with and updates the 2004 USPSTF recommendation. The current recommendation statement includes updated information on prevalence and risk factors in the United States and data on newer screening tests and approaches. Screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women is now addressed in a separate recommendation statement.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation3"">3</a></p>
<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2>
<p>The CDC recommends at least annual screening for sexually active MSM with confirmatory testing for individuals with reactive serology. Persons living with HIV should be screened at least annually; more frequent screening may be appropriate based on individual risk behaviors and local epidemiology. The CDC also recommends syphilis screening in correctional facilities on the basis of the local area and institutional prevalence.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation9"">9</a>&nbsp;The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists endorses the CDC&rsquo;s guidelines.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation20"">20</a>&nbsp;The HIV Medicine Association (part of the Infectious Diseases Society of America) recommends that all patients living with HIV be screened for syphilis on initiation of care and periodically thereafter, depending on risk.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation21"">21</a>&nbsp;The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends screening for syphilis infection in persons who are at increased risk for infection.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation22"">22</a></p>",https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents,"<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>The number of cases of primary and secondary syphilis have increased since 2000. In 2014, 19,999 cases (6.3 cases per 100,000 persons) of primary and secondary syphilis were reported in the United States.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;Left untreated, syphilis can progress to late-stage disease in approximately 15% of persons who are infected.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation2"">2</a>&nbsp;Consequences of late-stage syphilis include development of inflammatory lesions throughout the body (eg, aortitis, gummatous lesions, and osteitis), which can lead to cardiovascular or organ dysfunction. Syphilis infection of the central nervous system (neurosyphilis) can occur at any stage of disease and can result in blindness, paresis, tabes dorsalis, and dementia. Syphilis infection also increases the risk for acquiring or transmitting HIV infection.The USPSTF addresses screening for syphilis in pregnant women in a separate recommendation statement.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-adolescents#citation3"">3</a></p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>There are numerous screening tests for syphilis. Most common is a combination of nontreponemal and treponemal antibody tests. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening algorithms with high sensitivity and specificity are available to accurately detect syphilis.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that treatment with antibiotics can lead to substantial health benefits in nonpregnant persons who are at increased risk for syphilis infection by curing syphilis infection, preventing manifestations of late-stage disease, and preventing sexual transmission to others.</p>
<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found no direct evidence on the harms of screening for syphilis in nonpregnant persons who are at increased risk for infection. Potential harms of screening include false-positive results that require clinical evaluation, unnecessary anxiety to the patient, and the potential stigma of having a sexually transmitted infection. The harms of antibiotic treatment are well established, and the magnitude of these harms is no greater than small.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of screening for syphilis infection in nonpregnant persons who are at increased risk for infection is substantial.</p>",Screening for Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adults and Adolescents,"Syphilis Infection in Nonpregnant Adults and Adolescents, Screening, 2016",,,,,
66,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
These recommendations apply to adolescents, adults, and pregnant women. Screening for HIV infection could begin at age 15 years unless an individual is identified at an earlier age with risk factors for HIV infection. Screening after age 65 years is indicated if there is ongoing risk for HIV infection, as indicated by risk assessment (for example, new sexual partners).
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
According to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), men who have sex with men account for about 60% of HIV-positive persons in the United States. Among men living with HIV infection who were diagnosed at age 13 years or older, 68% of infections are attributed to male-to-male sexual contact, 8% are attributed to male-to-male sexual contact and injection drug use, and 11% are attributed to heterosexual contact. Among women living with HIV infection, 74% of infections are attributed to heterosexual contact and the remainder to injection drug use. According to the CDC, heterosexual contact accounted for an estimated 25% of new HIV infections in 2010 and 27% of existing infections in 2009. Data from the CDC on HIV prevalence in different subpopulations are available at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance"">www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance</a>.On the basis of HIV prevalence data, the USPSTF considers men who have sex with men and active injection drug users to be at very high risk for new HIV infection. Behavioral risk factors for HIV infection include having unprotected vaginal or anal intercourse; having sexual partners who are HIV-infected, bisexual, or injection drug users; or exchanging sex for drugs or money. Other persons at high risk include those who have acquired or request testing for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Patients may request HIV testing in the absence of reported risk factors. Individuals not at increased risk for HIV infection include persons who are not sexually active, those who are sexually active in exclusive monogamous relationships with uninfected partners, and those who do not fall into any of the aforementioned categories. The USPSTF recognizes that these categories are not mutually exclusive, the degree of sexual risk is on a continuum, and individuals may not be aware of their sexual partners' risk factors for HIV infection. For patients younger than 15 years and older than 65 years, it would be reasonable for clinicians to consider HIV risk factors among individual patients, especially those with new sexual partners. However, clinicians should bear in mind that adolescent and adult patients may be reluctant to disclose having HIV risk factors, even when asked.
<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>
The evidence is insufficient to determine optimum time intervals for HIV screening. One reasonable approach would be one-time screening of adolescent and adult patients to identify persons who are already HIV-positive, with repeated screening of those who are known to be at risk for HIV infection, those who are actively engaged in risky behaviors, and those who live or receive medical care in a high-prevalence setting. According to the CDC, a high-prevalence setting is a geographic location or community with an HIV seroprevalence of at least 1%. These settings include sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics, correctional facilities, homeless shelters, tuberculosis clinics, clinics serving men who have sex with men, and adolescent health clinics with a high prevalence of STDs. Patient populations that would more likely benefit from more frequent testing include those who are known to be at higher risk for HIV infection, those who are actively engaged in risky behaviors, and those who live in a high-prevalence setting. Given the paucity of available evidence for specific screening intervals, a reasonable approach may be to rescreen groups at very high risk (see <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/hiv/hivfinalrs.htm#risk"">Assessment of Risk</a>) for new HIV infection at least annually and individuals at increased risk at somewhat longer intervals (for example, 3 to 5 years). Routine rescreening may not be necessary for individuals who have not been at increased risk since they were found to be HIV-negative. Women screened during a previous pregnancy should be rescreened in subsequent pregnancies.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
The conventional serum test for diagnosing HIV infection is the repeatedly reactive immunoassay followed by confirmatory Western blot or immunofluorescent assay. The test is highly accurate (sensitivity and specificity, &gt;99.5%), and results are available within 1 to 2 days from most commercial laboratories.Rapid HIV testing may use either blood or oral fluid specimens and can provide results in 5 to 40 minutes. The sensitivity and specificity of the rapid test are also both greater than 99.5%; however, initial positive results require confirmation with conventional methods.Other U.S. Food and Drug Administration&ndash;approved tests for detection and confirmation of HIV infection include combination tests (for p24 antigen and HIV antibodies) and qualitative HIV-1 RNA.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
No cure for chronic HIV infection currently exists. However, appropriately timed interventions in HIV-positive persons can reduce risks for clinical progression, complications or death from the disease, and disease transmission. Effective interventions include ART (specifically, the use of combined ART, defined as &ge;3 antiretroviral agents used together, usually from &ge;2 classes), immunizations, and prophylaxis for opportunistic infections.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
The USPSTF recognizes that the most effective strategy for reducing HIV-related morbidity and mortality in the United States is primary prevention or avoidance of exposure to HIV infection. Condom use can also substantially decrease the risk for transmission of HIV and other STIs. The USPSTF recommends high-intensity behavioral counseling to prevent STIs for all sexually active adolescents and for adults at increased risk for infection. More information can be found at <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsstds.htm"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsstds.htm</a>. The Community Preventive Services Task Force has made several recommendations related to the prevention of HIV, AIDS, and other STIs, including person-to-person behavioral interventions (information and skill building to change knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and self-efficacy) for men who have sex with men that can be implemented at the individual, group, or community level. It also recommends health provider notification and encouragement for HIV testing for sexual or needle-sharing partners of individuals diagnosed with HIV, as well as comprehensive risk reduction interventions in adolescents.

<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
For populations in which the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV infection is known to be 0.1% or less (that is, &le;1 person in 1,000 is HIV-positive), where the potential benefit per person screened is low, it is reasonable to forgo routine HIV screening and instead screen on the basis of risk assessment. The CDC suggests that for populations in which the prevalence of HIV infection has not been documented, clinicians should initiate voluntary routine screening. If no HIV-infected patients are found after screening of approximately 4,000 patients, the upper limit of the 95% CI for prevalence is less than 0.1%&nbsp;and routine screening may be discontinued and replaced with risk-based screening. The USPSTF concurs with the CDC's recommendation that HIV screening should be voluntary and done only with the patient's knowledge and understanding. Patients should be informed orally or in writing that HIV testing will be performed unless they decline (opt-out screening). The USPSTF further concurs with the CDC's recommendation that before HIV testing, patients should receive an explanation of HIV infection and the meaning of positive and negative test results. Patients should also be offered the opportunity to ask questions and to decline testing. The CDC's recommendations on HIV testing in adults, adolescents, and pregnant women in health care settings are available at <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5514a1.htm"">www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5514a1.htm</a>.
<h3>Cost-Effectiveness Analysis</h3>
The USPSTF's deliberations on grade recommendations for the effectiveness of clinical preventive services do not include cost or cost-effectiveness considerations. For policy context, however, the USPSTF reviewed some cost-effectiveness analyses published since its previous review. These analyses, which include downstream costs, support the cost-effectiveness of HIV screening in settings with low or average HIV prevalence. No studies directly compared universal versus targeted screening in low-prevalence populations or explicitly considered the potential long-term cardiovascular harms of ART.
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Individuals who begin ART tend to continue receiving it for an extended length of time. Better evidence is needed about the long-term harms of ART, including risks for cardiovascular and kidney disease. Further follow-up is necessary to better delineate potential long-term harms of ART initiation at higher CD4 cell counts. It would also be helpful to better elucidate the potential risks and long-term outcomes associated with in utero or perinatal exposure to ART. Antiretroviral treatment guidelines are regularly updated and available at <a href=""http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines"">http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines</a>. Direct evidence of the effectiveness of ART and behavioral counseling in reducing HIV transmission among men who have sex with men and other high-risk groups could also guide prevention and treatment strategies. Similarly, additional studies are needed to better define the optimum timing for treatment initiation. More research is needed about the differential effects of various HIV screening strategies on testing acceptability and uptake, linkage to and receipt of care, and harms. Information that could quantify any incremental benefits and harms of repeated HIV screening and identify ideal time intervals for rescreening in different populations would be useful.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/hiv/hivfinalrs.htm#consider,126,"In 2006, the CDC recommended routine voluntary HIV screening in all adolescents and adults aged 13 to 64 years regardless of other recognized risk factors, unless the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV infection has been documented to be less than 0.1%. The CDC also recommended opt-out HIV testing, meaning that all patients should be informed about and undergo testing unless they specifically decline, without a requirement for prevention counseling before screening in order to reduce barriers to testing. In 2009, the American College of Physicians endorsed the CDC's approach. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends routine HIV screening for all sexually active adults. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends routine opt-out screening in all women aged 19 to 64 years and targeted screening in women with risk factors outside of that age range. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends offering routine HIV testing to all adolescents at least once by age 16 to 18 years when HIV prevalence is greater than 0.1% in the community, as well as testing of all sexually active adolescents and those with risk factors in low-prevalence settings. The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends that clinicians screen adolescents and adults aged 18 to 65 years for HIV infection, as well as younger adolescents and older adults who are at increased risk.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/hiv/hivfinalrs.htm#recommendations,,Screening for HIV,"HIV, Screening, 2013",,,,,
67,"The <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/grades.htm#brec"">B recommendation</a> applies to adults aged 18 years and older, and the <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/grades.htm#irec"">I statement</a>&nbsp;applies to adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. Although pregnant women are included, this recommendation is related to decreasing risky or hazardous drinking, not to complete abstinence, which is recommended for all pregnant women. These recommendations do not apply to persons who are actively seeking evaluation or treatment for alcohol misuse.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
The USPSTF considers 3 tools as the instruments of choice for screening for alcohol misuse in the primary care setting: the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), the abbreviated AUDIT-Consumption (AUDIT-C), and single-question screening (for example, the NIAAA recommends asking, &ldquo;How many times in the past year have you had 5 [for men] or 4 [for women and all adults older than 65 years] or more drinks in a day?&rdquo;).Of available screening tools, AUDIT is the most widely studied for detecting alcohol misuse in primary care settings; both AUDIT and the abbreviated AUDIT-C have good sensitivity and specificity for detecting the full spectrum of alcohol misuse across multiple populations. AUDIT comprises 10 questions and requires approximately 2 to 5 minutes to administer; AUDIT-C comprises 3 questions and takes 1 to 2 minutes to complete. Single-question screening also has adequate sensitivity and specificity across the alcohol-misuse spectrum and requires less than 1 minute to administer.
<h3>Behavioral Counseling Interventions</h3>
Behavioral counseling interventions for alcohol misuse vary in their specific components, administration, length, and number of interactions. They may include cognitive behavioral strategies, such as action plans, drinking diaries, stress management, or problem solving. Interventions may be delivered by face-to-face sessions, written self-help materials, computer- or Web-based programs, or telephone counseling. For the purposes of this recommendation statement, the USPSTF uses the following definitions of intervention intensity: very brief single contact (&le;5 minutes), brief single contact (6 to 15 minutes), brief multicontact (each contact is 6 to 15 minutes), and extended multicontact (&ge;1 contact, each &gt;15 minutes). Brief multicontact behavioral counseling seems to have the best evidence of effectiveness; very brief behavioral counseling has limited effect.The USPSTF found that counseling interventions in the primary care setting can positively affect unhealthy drinking behaviors in adults engaging in risky or hazardous drinking. Positive outcomes include reducing weekly alcohol consumption and long-term adherence to recommended drinking limits. Because brief behavioral counseling interventions decrease the proportion of persons who engage in episodes of heavy drinking (which results in high blood alcohol concentration [BAC]), indirect evidence supports the effect of screening and brief behavioral counseling interventions on important health outcomes, such as the probability of traumatic injury or death, especially that related to motor vehicles.Although screening detects persons along the entire spectrum of alcohol misuse, trials of behavioral counseling interventions in primary care settings largely focused on risky or hazardous drinking rather than alcohol abuse or dependence. Limited evidence suggests that brief behavioral counseling interventions are generally ineffective as singular treatments for alcohol abuse or dependence. The USPSTF did not formally evaluate other interventions (such as pharmacotherapy or outpatient treatment programs) for alcohol abuse or dependence, but the benefits of specialty treatment are well-established and recommended for persons meeting the diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence.
<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>
Evidence is lacking to determine the optimal interval for screening for alcohol misuse in adults.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
In deciding whether to screen adolescents for alcohol misuse and provide behavioral counseling interventions, primary care providers should consider the following factors.
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
In 2010, approximately 14% of adolescents in the 8th grade and 41% in the 12th grade reported using alcohol at least once within the past 30 days; 7% and 23%, respectively, reported consuming at least 5 or more drinks on a single occasion (an episode of heavy use) within the previous 2 weeks. Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for adolescents; according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, about 4% of 16-year-olds and 9% of 17-year-olds in 2009 drove under the influence of alcohol at least once during the previous year. Thirty-seven percent of traffic deaths among youth aged 16 to 20 years involve alcohol, and these deaths frequently involve alcohol-impaired drivers with lower BACs than other age groups.
<h4>Costs</h4>
Behavioral counseling interventions are associated with a time commitment ranging from 5 minutes to 2 hours, spread over multiple contacts. There are potential financial costs for parents and caregivers from lost work hours and travel to and from the provider.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
Potential harms associated with screening for alcohol misuse include anxiety, stigma or labeling, and interference with the clinician-patient relationship. Although evidence is very limited, no direct harms were identified for any population in available studies.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
Research suggests that although a majority of pediatricians and family practice clinicians report providing some alcohol prevention services to adolescent patients, they do not universally or consistently screen and counsel for alcohol misuse. Barriers include a perceived lack of time, familiarity with screening tools, training in managing positive results, and available treatment resources.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The AUDIT and AUDIT-C screening instruments for alcohol misuse are available from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration-Health Resources and Services Administration Center for Integrated Health Solutions (<a href=""http://www.integration.samhsa.gov/clinical-practice/screening-tools"">www.integration.samhsa.gov/clinical-practice/screening-tools</a>). Further details about the single-question screening method, as well as resources on primary care&ndash;feasible behavioral interventions, are available from the NIAAA (<a href=""http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/Practitioner/CliniciansGuide2005/guide.pdf"">http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/Practitioner/CliniciansGuide2005/guide.pdf</a>). <br /><br />The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends electronic screening and brief intervention to reduce excessive alcohol consumption. Electronic screening and brief intervention uses electronic devices (for example, computers, telephones, or mobile devices) to facilitate screening for excessive drinking and delivering a brief intervention that provides personalized feedback about the risks and consequences of excessive drinking. Delivery of personalized feedback can range from fully automated (computer-based) to interactive (provided by a person over the telephone). At least one part of the brief intervention must be delivered by an electronic device. Electronic screening and brief intervention can be delivered in various settings, such as health care systems, universities, or communities. The Community Preventive Services Task Force found limited information on the effectiveness of electronic screening and brief intervention among adolescents. The Community Preventive Services Task Force has also evaluated public health interventions (those that occur outside of the clinical practice setting) to prevent excessive alcohol consumption. It recommends instituting liability laws for establishments that sell or serve alcohol, increasing taxes on alcohol, maintaining limits on days and hours of the sale of alcohol, and regulating alcohol outlet density in communities as effective in preventing or reducing alcohol-related harms. It also recommends enhanced enforcement of laws prohibiting the sale of alcohol to minors. More information about the Community Preventive Services Task Force's recommendations on alcohol misuse is available at <a href=""http://www.thecommunityguide.org/alcohol/index.html"">www.thecommunityguide.org/alcohol/index.html</a>.<br /><br /> The Cochrane Collaboration has performed 2 systematic reviews to evaluate the effects of universal school- and family-based prevention programs to prevent or reduce alcohol misuse in young people. Although not entirely consistent across studies, evidence generally supported the effectiveness of certain school-based psychosocial and developmental programs, such as the Life Skills Training Program, the Unplugged Program, and the Good Behavior Game. Similarly, evidence generally supported small but positive effects from family-based interventions in preventing alcohol misuse in young people. The USPSTF has made recommendations on screening for and interventions to decrease the unhealthy use of other substances, including illicit drugs and tobacco.

<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Alcohol misuse among adolescents is an important public health problem. Limited evidence is available to assess the effects of screening and behavioral counseling in adolescents, and high-quality studies specifically addressing this population are needed. Although there is adequate evidence that brief behavioral counseling interventions improve several intermediate outcomes for persons engaging in risky or hazardous drinking, there is little direct evidence describing the ultimate effect of these interventions on longer-term morbidity, mortality, or quality of life. Most trials of behavioral counseling for screening-detected alcohol misuse focused on risky or hazardous alcohol use; future research is needed to help explain whether persons engaging in harmful drinking or alcohol abuse might benefit from behavioral counseling interventions in the primary care setting. Finally, detailed information about the relative comparative effectiveness of specific behavioral counseling components or approaches is largely lacking, as is focused guidance on how to individualize treatment decisions for a given subpopulation.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/alcmisuse/alcmisusefinalrs.htm#consider,127,"The American Society of Addiction Medicine recommends that primary care providers routinely screen for the presence of alcohol use problems in patients, screen for risk factors for development of alcohol dependence, and provide appropriate interventions. The NIAAA encourages primary care clinicians to incorporate alcohol screening and interventions into their practices and provides specific tools to implement these activities.  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that obstetrician&ndash;gynecologists have a key role in screening and providing brief intervention, patient education, and treatment referral for their patients who drink alcohol at risk levels. For pregnant women and those at risk for pregnancy, it is important that obstetrician&ndash;gynecologists give compelling and clear advice to avoid alcohol use or provide assistance for achieving abstinence or effective contraception to women who require help.  The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that clinicians screen all adolescent patients for alcohol use with a formal, validated screening tool, such as the Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, Trouble (CRAFFT) substance abuse screening test, at every health supervision visit and appropriate acute care visits and respond to screening results with the appropriate brief intervention.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/alcmisuse/alcmisusefinalrs.htm#recommendations,,Screening and Behavioral Counseling Interventions in Primary Care to Reduce Alcohol Misuse,"Alcohol Misuse, Screening and Behavioral Counseling Interventions in Primary Care, 2013",,,,,
68,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to children in the general U.S. population from newborn to age 18 years who do not have signs or symptoms of maltreatment. &ldquo;Child maltreatment&rdquo; is defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a parent or other caregiver that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child. ""Child abuse&rdquo; (acts of commission) includes physical, sexual, and psychological abuse. &ldquo;Child neglect&rdquo; (acts of omission) includes the failure to provide for a child's basic physical, emotional, health care, or educational needs or to protect a child from harm or potential harm.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
Numerous risk factors are associated with child maltreatment, including but not limited to young, single, or nonbiological parents; parental lack of understanding of children's needs, child development, or parenting skills; poor parent&ndash;child relationships or negative interactions; parental thoughts or emotions that support maltreatment behaviors; family dysfunction or violence; parental history of abuse or neglect in the family of origin; substance abuse within the family; social isolation, poverty, or other socioeconomic disadvantages; and parental stress and distress.
<h3>Interventions</h3>
Although the evidence is insufficient to recommend specific preventive interventions in a clinical setting, most programs for prevention of child maltreatment studied and recommended by others focus on home visitation, which is generally considered to be a community-based service. Home visitation programs usually comprise a combination of services provided by a nurse or paraprofessional in a family's home on a regularly scheduled basis. Most home visitation programs are targeted to families with young children and often begin in the pre- or postnatal period.The services provided in home visitation programs often include parent education on normal child development, counseling, problem solving, free transportation to health clinic appointments, enhancement of informal support systems, linkage to community services, promotion of positive parent&ndash;child interactions, ensuring a source for regular health care, promotion of environmental safety, and classes for preparing for motherhood. The one trial reviewed by the USPSTF that was not a home visitation program used a multistep approach in a primary care clinic, with a social worker available to help parents who self-reported psychosocial problems, such as substance abuse.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
Child maltreatment is a serious problem that affected more than 680,000 children and resulted in 1,570 deaths in 2011. It can result in lifelong negative consequences for victims. Most child maltreatment is in the form of neglect (approximately 78%), and most deaths occur in children younger than 4 years (approximately 80%).
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
There is limited evidence on harms of interventions to prevent child maltreatment. Reported potential harms include dissolution of families, legal concerns, and an increased risk for further harm to the child.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
All states and the District of Columbia have laws that mandate that all professionals who have contact with children, including all health care workers, report suspected maltreatment to Child Protective Services (CPS). Pediatricians, family physicians, and other primary care providers are in a unique position to identify children at risk of maltreatment through well-child and other visits. However, although pediatricians state that preventing maltreatment is one of their primary roles, they rarely explicitly screen for family violence in practice or screen only in selected cases. All states have home visiting programs to support families with young children, but the services provided in these programs and the eligibility criteria vary by state.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
The USPSTF has published a new recommendation on screening for intimate partner violence and abuse of elderly and vulnerable adults (available at <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org)</a>. The Community Preventive Services Task has issued a recommendation on early childhood home visitation to prevent child maltreatment (available at <a href=""http://www.thecommunityguide.org/violence/home/index.html"">http://www.thecommunityguide.org/violence/home/index.html</a>).
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
The USPSTF recognizes the importance of this serious health problem and that research in numerous areas related to reducing child maltreatment should be a priority. The relationship between harsh punishment (such as spanking) and abuse needs to be further explored, as does that between intimate partner violence and child maltreatment. Additional research is also needed to determine effective methods for physicians and other health care clinicians to identify children at risk for or currently experiencing maltreatment. The lack of studies on the prevention of maltreatment of older children, which was identified in the USPSTF's previous recommendation as an important evidence gap, has yet to be addressed. Research is also needed to confirm the efficacy and expand the applicability of the observed benefits reported in some of the intervention studies reviewed by the USPSTF.  Standardization of interventions and outcomes would strengthen the evidence and allow quantitative meta-analysis. Research is also needed to determine whether there are unintended harms from screening, risk assessment, and interventions. In all areas related to child maltreatment, more data are needed on how best to measure outcomes related to child abuse and neglect.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/childabuse/childmaltreatfinalrs.htm#consider,128,"In 2010, the American Academy of Pediatrics published a clinical report advocating for a prominent role of pediatricians in prevention of maltreatment and provided specific guidelines and information on risk factors and protective factors. The American Medical Association recommends routine inquiry about child abuse or neglect. The American Academy of Family Physicians recently concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of primary care interventions to prevent child maltreatment. Other organizations do not specifically recommend universal screening but recommend that pediatricians and family practice clinicians remain alert for indications of maltreatment&nbsp;or recommend screening in pediatric offices for intimate partner and family violence.  The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care issued several recommendations related to child maltreatment in 2000 and recommended against screening for persons at risk for experiencing or committing child maltreatment (D recommendation). However, it recommended home visitation for disadvantaged families from the prenatal period through infancy but found no good evidence to include or exclude a referral for a comprehensive health care program; a parent education and support program; or a combined service program that includes case management, education, and psychotherapy for the prevention of child maltreatment. &ldquo;Disadvantaged families&rdquo; are defined as first-time mothers with one or more of the following characteristics: age younger than 19 years, single-parent status, and low socioeconomic status. The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends early childhood home visitation interventions to prevent child maltreatment.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/childabuse/childmaltreatfinalrs.htm#recommendations,,Primary Care Interventions to Prevent Child Maltreatment,"Child Maltreatment, Primary Care Interventions, 2013",,,,,
69,"<b>Patient Population </b><br>
This recommendation applies to the general adult population, including adults with diabetes. The USPSTF did not review evidence for screening certain groups at high risk for severe urinary tract infections, such as transplant recipients, patients with sickle cell disease, and patients with recurrent urinary tract infections.<br><br>

<b>Screening Tests </b><br>
The screening tests used commonly in the primary care setting (dipstick analysis and direct microscopy) have poor positive and negative predictive value for detecting bacteriuria in asymptomatic persons. Urine culture is the gold standard for detecting asymptomatic bacteriuria but is expensive for routine screening in populations with a low prevalence of the condition. However, no currently available tests have a high enough sensitivity and negative predictive value in pregnant women to replace the urine culture as the preferred screening test.<br><br>

<b>Treatment</b><br>
Pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria should receive antibiotic therapy directed at the cultured organism and follow-up monitoring.<br><br>

<b>Screening Intervals </b><br>
All pregnant women should provide a clean-catch urine specimen for a screening culture at 12 to 16 weeks' gestation or at the first prenatal visit, if later. The optimal frequency of subsequent urine testing during pregnancy is uncertain.<br>",www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf08/asymptbact/asbactrs.htm#clinical,90,"<b>Recommendations of Others</b><br>
The American Academy of Family Physicians strongly recommends that all pregnant women be screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria using urine culture at 12 to 16 weeks' gestation or at the first prenatal visit if after that time.<br><br> 

The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends screening pregnant women for asymptomatic bacteriuria with a urine culture ""at least once"" in early pregnancy. It also states that screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant women, diabetic women, or community-dwelling or institutionalized older persons is not indicated.<br><br>

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria ""early in pregnancy, as appropriate"".<br><br>

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant women with diabetes mellitus.

",www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf08/asymptbact/asbactrs.htm#recommendations,"<br><b>Importance:</b> In pregnant women, asymptomatic bacteriuria has been associated with an increased incidence of pyelonephritis and low birthweight (birthweight <2500 g).<br><br>

<b>Detection:</b> Asymptomatic bacteriuria can be reliably detected through urine culture. The presence of at least 105 colony-forming units per mL of urine, of a single uropathogen, and in a midstream clean-catch specimen is considered a positive test result.<br><br>

<b>Benefits of Detection and Early Intervention:</b> In pregnant women, convincing evidence indicates that detection of and treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria with antibiotics significantly reduces the incidence of symptomatic maternal urinary tract infections and low birthweight.<br><br>

In men and nonpregnant women, adequate evidence suggests that screening men and nonpregnant women for asymptomatic bacteriuria is ineffective in improving clinical outcomes.<br><br>

<b>Harms of Detection and Early Treatment:</b> Potential harms associated with treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria include adverse effects from antibiotics and development of bacterial resistance. Without evidence of benefits from screening men and nonpregnant women, the potential harms associated with overuse of antibiotics are especially significant.<br><br>

<b>USPSTF Assessment:</b> The USPSTF concludes that 1) in pregnant women, there is high certainty that the net benefit of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria is substantial, and 2) in men and nonpregnant women, there is moderate certainty that the harms of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria outweigh the benefits.",Asymptomatic Bacteriuria,"Asymptomatic Bacteriuria, Screening, 2008 ",,,,,
70,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
<p>This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults 50 years and older who are at average risk of colorectal cancer and who do not have a family history of known genetic disorders that predispose them to a high lifetime risk of colorectal cancer (such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis), a personal history of inflammatory bowel disease, a previous adenomatous polyp, or previous colorectal cancer.<br /><br />When screening results in the diagnosis of colorectal adenomas or cancer, patients are followed up with a surveillance regimen, and recommendations for screening no longer apply. The USPSTF did not review or consider the evidence on the effectiveness of any particular surveillance regimen after diagnosis and removal of adenomatous polyps or colorectal cancer.</p>
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
<p>For the vast majority of adults, the most important risk factor for colorectal cancer is older age. Most cases of colorectal cancer occur among adults older than 50 years; the median age at diagnosis is 68 years.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation3"">3</a><br /><br />A positive family history (excluding known inherited familial syndromes) is thought to be linked to about 20% of cases of colorectal cancer.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;About 3% to 10% of the population has a first-degree relative with colorectal cancer.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation7"">7</a>&nbsp;The USPSTF did not specifically review the evidence on screening in populations at increased risk; however, other professional organizations recommend that patients with a family history of colorectal cancer (a first-degree relative with early-onset colorectal cancer or multiple first-degree relatives with the disease) be screened more frequently starting at a younger age, and with colonoscopy.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation8"">8</a><br /><br />Male sex and black race are also associated with higher colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. Black adults have the highest incidence and mortality rates compared with other racial/ethnic subgroups.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation3"">3</a>&nbsp;The reasons for these disparities are not entirely clear. Studies have documented inequalities in screening, diagnostic follow-up, and treatment; they also suggest that equal treatment generally seems to produce equal outcomes.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation9"">9-11</a>&nbsp;Accordingly, this recommendation applies to all racial/ethnic groups, with the clear acknowledgement that efforts are needed to ensure that at-risk populations receive recommended screening, follow-up, and treatment.</p>
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>

The&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#fig"">Figure</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>presents the estimated number of life-years gained, colorectal cancer deaths averted, lifetime colonoscopies required, and resulting complications per 1,000 screened adults aged 50 to 75 years for each of the screening strategies. These estimates are derived from modeling conducted by the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) to inform this recommendation.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2"">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation12"">12</a></p>
<h4>Stool-Based Tests</h4>
<p>Multiple randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have shown that screening with the guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) reduces colorectal cancer deaths.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;Fecal immunochemical tests (FITs), which identify intact human hemoglobin in stool, have improved sensitivity compared with gFOBT for detecting colorectal cancer.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;Among the FITs that are cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and available for use in the United States, the OC FIT-CHEK family of FITs (Polymedco)&mdash;which include the OC-Light and the OC-Auto&mdash;have the best test performance characteristics (ie, highest sensitivity and specificity).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;Multitargeted stool DNA testing (FIT-DNA) is an emerging screening strategy that combines a FIT with testing for altered DNA biomarkers in cells shed into the stool. Multitargeted stool DNA testing has increased single-test sensitivity for detecting colorectal cancer compared with FIT alone.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation13"">13</a>&nbsp;The harms of stool-based testing primarily result from adverse events associated with follow-up colonoscopy of positive findings.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;The specificity of FIT-DNA is lower than that of FIT alone,<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation13"">13</a>&nbsp;which means it has a higher number of false-positive results and higher likelihood of follow-up colonoscopy and experiencing an associated adverse event per screening test. There are no empirical data on the appropriate longitudinal follow-up for an abnormal FIT-DNA test result followed by a negative colonoscopy; there is potential for overly intensive surveillance due to clinician and patient concerns about the implications of the genetic component of the test.</p>
<h4>Direct Visualization Tests</h4>
<p>Several RCTs have shown that flexible sigmoidoscopy alone reduces deaths from colorectal cancer.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;Flexible sigmoidoscopy combined with FIT has been studied in a single trial and was found to reduce the colorectal cancer&ndash;specific mortality rate more than flexible sigmoidoscopy alone.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation14"">14</a>&nbsp;Modeling studies conducted by CISNET also consistently estimate that combined testing yields more life-years gained and colorectal cancer deaths averted compared with flexible sigmoidoscopy alone.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2"">2</a>&nbsp;Flexible sigmoidoscopy can result in direct harms, such as colonic perforations and bleeding, although the associated event rates are much lower than those observed with colonoscopy.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;Harms can also occur as a result of follow-up colonoscopy.<br /><br />Completed trials of flexible sigmoidoscopy provide indirect evidence that colonoscopy&mdash;a similar endoscopic screening method&mdash;reduces colorectal cancer mortality. A prospective cohort study also found an association between patients who self-reported being screened with colonoscopy and a lower colorectal cancer mortality rate.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation15"">15</a>&nbsp;Colonoscopy has both indirect and direct harms. Harms may be caused by bowel preparation prior to the procedure (eg, dehydration and electrolyte imbalances), the sedation used during the procedure (eg, cardiovascular events), or the procedure itself (eg, infection, colonic perforations, or bleeding).<br /><br />Evidence for assessing the effectiveness of computed tomography (CT) colonography is limited to studies of its test characteristics.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>Computed tomography colonography can result in unnecessary diagnostic testing or treatment of incidental extracolonic findings that are of no importance or would never have threatened the patient&rsquo;s health or become apparent without screening (ie, overdiagnosis and overtreatment).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;Extracolonic findings are common, occurring in about 40% to 70% of screening examinations. Between 5% and 37% of these findings result in diagnostic follow-up, and about 3% require definitive treatment.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;As with other screening strategies, indirect harms from CT colonography can also occur from follow-up colonoscopy for positive findings.</p>
<h4>Serology Tests</h4>
<p>The FDA approved a blood test to detect circulating methylated&nbsp;<em>SEPT9</em>&nbsp;DNA (Epi proColon; Epigenomics) in April 2016.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation16"">16</a>&nbsp;A single test characteristic study met the inclusion criteria for the systematic evidence review supporting this recommendation statement; it found the&nbsp;<em>SEPT9&nbsp;</em>DNA test to have low sensitivity (48%) for detecting colorectal cancer.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation17"">17</a></p>
<h3>Starting and Stopping Ages</h3>
<p>Available RCTs of gFOBT and flexible sigmoidoscopy included patients with age ranges of 45 to 80 years and 50 to 74 years, respectively. For gFOBT, the majority of participants entered the trials at age 50 or 60 years; for flexible sigmoidoscopy, the mean age of participants was 56 to 60 years.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a><br /><br />Microsimulation analyses performed by CISNET suggest that starting colorectal cancer screening at age 45 years rather than 50 years is estimated to yield a modest increase in life-years gained and a more efficient balance between life-years gained and lifetime number of colonoscopies (a proxy measure for the burden of screening).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2"">2</a>&nbsp;However, across the different screening methods, lowering the age at which to begin screening to 45 years while maintaining the same screening interval resulted in an estimated increase in the lifetime number of colonoscopies. In the case of screening colonoscopy, 2 of the 3 models found that by starting screening at age 45 years, the screening interval could be extended from 10 to 15 years. Doing so maintained the same (or slightly more) life-years gained as performing colonoscopy every 10 years starting at age 50 years without increasing the lifetime number of colonoscopies. However, 1 model estimated a slight loss in life-years gained with a longer screening interval and an earlier age at which to begin screening.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2"">2</a><br /><br />The USPSTF considered these findings and concluded that the evidence best supports a starting age of 50 years for the general population, noting the modest increase in life-years gained by starting screening earlier, the discordant findings across models for extending the screening interval when the age at which to begin screening is lowered, and the lack of empirical evidence in younger populations.<br /><br />The age at which the balance of benefits and harms of colorectal cancer screening becomes less favorable varies based on a patient&rsquo;s life expectancy, health status, comorbid conditions, and prior screening status.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation18"">18</a>&nbsp;Empirical data from randomized trials on outcomes of screening after age 74 years are scarce. All 3 CISNET models consistently estimate that few additional life-years are gained when screening is extended past age 75 years among average-risk adults who have previously received adequate screening.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2"">2</a><br /><br />The USPSTF does not recommend routine screening for colorectal cancer in adults 86 years and older. In this age group, competing causes of mortality preclude a mortality benefit that would outweigh the harms.</p>
<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>
<p>Evidence from RCTs demonstrates that annual or biennial screening with gFOBT as well as 1-time and every 3- to 5-year flexible sigmoidoscopy reduces colorectal cancer deaths.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;The CISNET models found that several screening strategies were estimated to yield comparable life-years gained (ie, life-years gained with the noncolonoscopy strategies were within 90% of those gained with the colonoscopy strategy) among adults aged 50 to 75 years and an efficient balance of benefits and harms (see the full CISNET report for more details<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2"">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation12"">12</a>). These screening strategies include 1) annual screening with FIT, 2) screening every 10 years with flexible sigmoidoscopy and annual screening with FIT, 3) screening every 10 years with colonoscopy, and 4) screening every 5 years with CT colonography. The findings for CT colonography depend on the proxy measure used for the burden of screening (number of lifetime colonoscopies or lifetime cathartic bowel preparations). Two of the 3 CISNET models found that FIT-DNA screening every 3 years (as recommended by the manufacturer) was estimated to yield life-years gained less than 90% of the colonoscopy screening strategy (84% and 87%, respectively). Another way to conceptualize these findings is to note that CISNET modeling found that FIT-DNA screening every 3 years was estimated to provide about the same amount of benefit as screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy alone every 5 years (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#fig"">Figure</a>).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation2"">2</a></p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Treatment of early-stage colorectal cancer generally consists of local excision or simple polypectomy for tumors limited to the colonic mucosa or surgical resection (via laparoscopy or open approach) with anastomosis for larger, localized lesions.</p>
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
<p>The USPSTF has made a recommendation on aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer in average-risk adults (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).</p>",,166,"<h3><em><strong>Other Considerations</strong></em></h3>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Colorectal cancer causes substantial morbidity and mortality, and the evidence is convincing that screening for colorectal cancer reduces that burden. Despite the availability of several effective screening options, nearly one-third of eligible adults have never been screened.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation19"">19</a>&nbsp;Different screening methods may be more or less attractive for patients based on their features. For example, colonoscopy requires a relatively greater time commitment over a short period (bowel preparation, procedure, and recovery) but allows for much longer time between screenings compared with stool-based screening. Stool-based screening requires persons to handle their feces, which may be difficult for some, but the test is quick and noninvasive and can be done at home (the sample is mailed to the laboratory for testing). Flexible sigmoidoscopy combined with annual FIT may be an attractive option for persons who want reassurance from endoscopic screening but want to limit their exposure to colonoscopy. Given the lack of evidence from head-to-head comparative trials that any of the screening strategies have a greater net benefit than the others, clinicians should consider engaging patients in informed decision making about the screening strategy that would most likely result in completion, with high adherence over time, taking into consideration both the patient&rsquo;s preferences and local availability.For colorectal cancer screening programs to be successful in reducing mortality, they need to involve more than just the screening method in isolation. Screening is a cascade of activities that must occur in concert, cohesively, and in an organized way for benefits to be realized, from the point of the initial screening examination (including related interventions or services that are required for successful administration of the screening test, such as bowel preparation or sedation with endoscopy) to the timely receipt of any necessary diagnostic follow-up and treatment.Multiple effective implementation strategies have been demonstrated to increase appropriate provision and use of colorectal cancer screening. Specifically, the Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends using clinician and patient reminder systems, using small media (such as videos, letters, and brochures), reducing structural barriers to screening (such as the time or distance to the screening delivery setting or offering extended or nonstandard clinic hours), and providing clinician assessment and feedback about screening rates (more information is available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.thecommunityguide.org/cancer/index.html"" target=""_blank"">www.thecommunityguide.org/cancer</a><a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/exit-disclaimer"" title=""This link goes offsite.

<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
<p>Higher-quality data are needed about the natural history of small (&lt;10 mm) adenomas to improve understanding of optimal screening and surveillance strategies and to guide when clinical intervention is necessary. Further, because determining the ultimate worth of a screening method requires an accurate assessment of the net benefit of that intervention, randomized trials are needed to directly compare different types of colorectal cancer screening programs to more clearly define their relative benefits and harms; however, the USPSTF appreciates the challenges inherent in performing such trials, given the large sample sizes and long time horizons required.A recent analysis of data from the National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program suggests that the incidence of colorectal cancer may be increasing among adults younger than 50 years.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation20"">20</a>&nbsp;Modeling suggests there may be some potential advantages to starting colonoscopy screening at an earlier age (45 years) and to extending the interval between screenings with negative findings.Black and Alaska Native individuals have a higher incidence of and mortality rate from colorectal cancer compared with the general population. Empirical data about the effectiveness of different screening strategies for these at-risk populations are not available.Although there is a growing body of evidence on the test performance characteristics of CT colonography, evidence to bound the potential harms of this technology is still lacking, particularly in regard to incidental findings. More consistent and complete reporting, in studies with longer-term follow-up, of the downstream consequences of initial detection, subsequent workup, and definitive treatment of extracolonic findings (ie, CT Colonography Reporting and Data System findings categorized as E3&mdash;&ldquo;likely unimportant finding, incompletely characterized: subject to local practice and patient preference, workup may be indicated&rdquo; and E4&mdash;&ldquo;potentially important finding: communicate to referring physician as per accepted practice guidelines&rdquo;) would allow for better understanding of the net benefit associated with this screening approach.Empirical evidence is lacking on the appropriate follow-up of abnormal results from FIT-DNA screening when the initial diagnostic colonoscopy is negative. There is a theoretical concern that FIT-DNA may generate inappropriate use of surveillance colonoscopy if clinicians and patients place increased importance on the genetic component of the test. At present, evidence is lacking to establish the optimal frequency of screening with the FIT-DNA test. As a condition of its approval of the test, the FDA required the manufacturer to conduct a longitudinal study examining the test characteristics of a 3-year screening interval; these data should help inform decisions.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation21"">21</a>Studies on patient adherence to the various screening options, within single-method screening programs over time, as well as factors that may influence adherence across different screening methods, are needed to help better inform and improve uptake of screening across eligible populations.</p>
<h3><em>Update to Previous USPSTF Recommendations</em></h3>
<p>This is an update of the 2008 USPSTF recommendation.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation27"">27</a>&nbsp;In 2008, the USPSTF recommended screening with colonoscopy every 10 years, annual FIT, annual high-sensitivity FOBT, or flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years combined with high-sensitivity FOBT every 3 years. In the current recommendation, instead of emphasizing specific screening approaches, the USPSTF has instead chosen to highlight that there is convincing evidence that colorectal cancer screening substantially reduces deaths from the disease among adults aged 50 to 75 years and that not enough adults in the United States are using this effective preventive intervention. The reasons for this gap between evidence and practice are multifaceted and will require sustained effort among clinicians, policy makers, advocates, and patients to overcome.</p>
<h3><em>Recommendatoins of Others</em></h3>
<p>Many organizations have issued guidelines concerning screening for colorectal cancer. All of the following recommendations apply to average-risk adults 50 years and older.In 2008, the American Cancer Society, American College of Radiology, and the US Multi-Society Task Force (including the American Gastroenterological Association, American College of Gastroenterology, and American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy) jointly issued recommendations. They prioritized flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, colonoscopy every 10 years, double-contrast barium enema every 5 years, and CT colonography every 5 years as preferred tests &ldquo;designed to both prevent and detect cancer&rdquo; if resources are available but also recommended annual high-sensitivity gFOBT or FIT-DNA testing (interval uncertain).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation8"">8</a>&nbsp;Shortly thereafter, the American College of Gastroenterology released an independent guideline recommending colonoscopy every 10 years as the single preferred screening strategy. It stated that if colonoscopy is not available or is unacceptable to a patient, recommended alternative strategies include flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 to 10 years or CT colonography every 5 years (preferred) or annual FIT, annual Hemoccult II SENSA, or FIT-DNA testing every 3 years (acceptable).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation28"">28</a>In 2012, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommended colonoscopy every 10 years as the preferred screening strategy if available; otherwise, it recommended annual gFOBT or FIT, with or without flexible sigmoidoscopy, every 5 years or flexible sigmoidoscopy alone every 5 years as secondary approaches to screening.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation29"">29</a>In 2015, the American College of Physicians recommended that average-risk adults aged 50 to 75 years should be screened for colorectal cancer by 1 of 4 strategies: 1) annual high-sensitivity gFOBT or FIT, 2) flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, 3) high-sensitivity gFOBT or FIT every 3 years plus flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, or 4) colonoscopy every 10 years. It advised that average-risk adults younger than 50 years, older than 75 years, or with an estimated life expectancy of less than 10 years should not be screened.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation30"">30</a>&nbsp;The American Academy of Family Physicians is in the process of updating its guidelines.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation31"">31</a>In 2016, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommended that adults aged 50 to 59 years (weak recommendation) and 60 to 74 years (strong recommendation) be screened for colorectal cancer with gFOBT or FIT every 2 years or flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years. It recommended against screening in adults 75 years and older (weak recommendation) and using colonoscopy as a primary screening test (weak recommendation).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation32"">32</a></p>",https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2,"<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in the United States. In 2016, an estimated 134,000 persons will be diagnosed with the disease, and about 49,000 will die from it. Colorectal cancer is most frequently diagnosed among adults aged 65 to 74 years; the median age at death from colorectal cancer is 68 years.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation3"">3</a></p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening for colorectal cancer with several different methods can accurately detect early-stage colorectal cancer and adenomatous polyps.<br /><br />Although single test performance is an important issue in the detection of colorectal cancer, the sensitivity of the test over time is more important in an ongoing screening program. However, data that permit assessment and direct comparison of screening methods to detect colorectal neoplasia in screening programs over time are limited to those from analytic modeling.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Screening and Early Intervention</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 75 years reduces colorectal cancer mortality. The USPSTF found no head-to-head studies demonstrating that any of the screening strategies it considered are more effective than others, although the tests have varying levels of evidence supporting their effectiveness, as well as different strengths and limitations (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#tab"">Table</a>). About one-third of eligible adults in the United States have never been screened for colorectal cancer,<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation4"">4</a>&nbsp;and offering choice in colorectal cancer screening strategies may increase screening uptake.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation5"">5</a>&nbsp;As such, the screening tests are not presented in any preferred or ranked order; rather, the goal is to maximize the total number of persons who are screened because that will have the largest effect on reducing colorectal cancer deaths.<br /><br />The benefit of early detection of and intervention for colorectal cancer declines after age 75 years. Among older adults who have been previously screened for colorectal cancer, there is at best a moderate benefit to continuing screening during the ages of 76 to 85 years. However, adults in this age group who have never been screened for colorectal cancer are more likely to benefit than those who have been previously screened.<br /><br />The time between detection and treatment of colorectal cancer and realization of a subsequent mortality benefit can be substantial. As such, the benefit of early detection of and intervention for colorectal cancer in adults 86 years and older is at most small.<br /><br />To date, no method of screening for colorectal cancer has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality in any age group.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation6"">6</a></p>
<h3>Harms of Screening and Early Intervention</h3>
<p>The harms of screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 75 years are small. The majority of harms result from the use of colonoscopy, either as the screening test or as follow-up for positive findings detected by other screening tests. The rate of serious adverse events from colorectal cancer screening increases with age.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;Thus, the harms of screening for colorectal cancer in adults 76 years and older are small to moderate.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit (ie, the benefit minus the harms) of screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 75 years is substantial.<br /><br />The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years who have been previously screened is small. Adults who have never been screened for colorectal cancer are more likely to benefit.</p>",Screening for Colorectal Cancer ,"Colorectal Cancer, Screening, 2016",,,,,
71,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to adults 18 years and older. It does not apply to children and adolescents, who are addressed in a separate USPSTF recommendation statement (available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
The USPSTF recommends screening in all adults regardless of risk factors. However, a number of factors are associated with an increased risk of depression. Among general adult populations, prevalence rates vary by sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, geographic location, and employment status. Women, young and middle-aged adults, and nonwhite persons have higher rates of depression than their counterparts, as do persons who are undereducated, previously married, or unemployed. Other groups who are at increased risk of developing depression include persons with chronic illnesses (eg, cancer or cardiovascular disease), other mental health disorders (including substance misuse), or a family history of psychiatric disorders.Among older adults, risk factors for depression include disability and poor health status related to medical illness, complicated grief, chronic sleep disturbance, loneliness, and a history of depression. However, the presence or absence of risk factors alone cannot distinguish patients with depression from those without depression.Risk factors for depression during pregnancy and postpartum include poor self-esteem, child-care stress, prenatal anxiety, life stress, decreased social support, single/unpartnered relationship status, history of depression, difficult infant temperament, previous postpartum depression, lower socioeconomic status, and unintended pregnancy.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Commonly used depression screening instruments include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) in various forms and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales in adults, the Geriatric Depression Scale in older adults, and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in postpartum and pregnant women. All positive screening results should lead to additional assessment that considers severity of depression and comorbid psychological problems (eg, anxiety, panic attacks, or substance abuse), alternate diagnoses, and medical conditions.
<h3>Screening Timing and Interval</h3>
There is little evidence regarding the optimal timing for screening. The optimum interval for screening for depression is also unknown; more evidence for all populations is needed to identify ideal screening intervals. A pragmatic approach in the absence of data might include screening all adults who have not been screened previously and using clinical judgment in consideration of risk factors, comorbid conditions, and life events to determine if additional screening of high-risk patients is warranted.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
Effective treatment of depression in adults generally includes antidepressants or specific psychotherapy approaches (eg, CBT or brief psychosocial counseling), alone or in combination. Given the potential harms to the fetus and newborn child from certain pharmacologic agents, clinicians are encouraged to consider CBT or other evidence-based counseling interventions when managing depression in pregnant or breastfeeding women.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
The Community Preventive Services Task Force, which makes evidence-based recommendations on preventive services for community populations, recommends collaborative care for the management of depressive disorders as part of a multicomponent, health care system&ndash;level intervention that uses case managers to link primary care providers, patients, and mental health specialists. More information about the Community Preventive Services Task Force and its recommendations on depression interventions is available on its website (<a href=""http://www.thecommunityguide.org/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.thecommunityguide.org</a><a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/exit-disclaimer"" title=""This link goes offsite.

The USPSTF recommends that screening be implemented with adequate systems in place. &ldquo;Adequate systems in place&rdquo; refers to having systems and clinical staff to ensure that patients are screened and, if they screen positive, are appropriately diagnosed and treated with evidence-based care or referred to a setting that can provide the necessary care. These essential functions can be provided through a wide range of different arrangements of clinician types and settings. In the available evidence, the lowest effective level of support consisted of a designated nurse who advised resident physicians of positive screening results and provided a protocol that facilitated referral to evidence-based behavioral treatment.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;At the highest level, support included screening; staff and clinician training (1- or 2-day workshops); clinician manuals; monthly training lectures; academic detailing; materials for clinicians, staff, and patients; an initial visit with a nurse specialist for assessment, education, and discussion of patient preferences and goals; a visit with a trained nurse specialist for follow-up assessment and ongoing support for medication adherence; a visit with a trained therapist for CBT; and a reduced copayment for patients referred for psychotherapy.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation2"">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation3"">3</a> Multidisciplinary team&ndash;based primary care that includes self management support and care coordination has been shown to be effective in management of depression.

As defined, collaborative care and disease management of depressive disorders include a systematic, multicomponent, and team-based approach that &ldquo;strengthens and supports self-care, while assuring that effective medical, preventive, and health maintenance interventions take place&rdquo; to improve the quality and outcome of patient care.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation4"">4</a>
<h3>Costs</h3>
The economic burden of depression is substantial for individuals as well as society. Costs to an individual may include emotional suffering, reduced quality of personal relationships, possible adverse effects from treatment, cost of mental health and medical visits and medications, time away from work and lost wages, and cost of transportation. Costs to society may include loss of life, reduced productivity (because of both diminished capacity while at work and absenteeism from work), and increased costs of mental health and medical care.
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
Gaps in the evidence on screening for depression in older adults in primary care include a lack of information from large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in settings that are applicable to the US population. More research is needed on the accuracy of screening tools in languages other than English and Spanish and to identify the timing and optimal screening interval in all populations. Data are lacking on both the accuracy of screening and the benefits and harms of treatment in pregnant women, as well as for the balance of benefits and harms of treatment with antidepressants in postpartum women. Finally, research is needed to assess barriers to establishing adequate systems of care and how these barriers can be addressed.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#Pod6,"<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Depression is among the leading causes of disability in persons 15 years and older. It affects individuals, families, businesses, and society and is common in patients seeking care in the primary care setting. Depression is also common in postpartum and pregnant women and affects not only the woman but her child as well.</p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening improves the accurate identification of adult patients with depression in primary care settings, including pregnant and postpartum women.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Intervention and Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that programs combining depression screening with adequate support systems in place improve clinical outcomes (ie, reduction or remission of depression symptoms) in adults, including pregnant and postpartum women.The USPSTF found convincing evidence that treatment of adults and older adults with depression identified through screening in primary care settings with antidepressants, psychotherapy, or both decreases clinical morbidity.The USPSTF also found adequate evidence that treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) improves clinical outcomes in pregnant and postpartum women with depression.</p>
<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Intervention and Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the magnitude of harms of screening for depression in adults is small to none.The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the magnitude of harms of treatment with CBT in postpartum and pregnant women is small to none.The USPSTF found that second-generation antidepressants (mostly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) are associated with some harms, such as an increase in suicidal behaviors in adults aged 18 to 29 years and an increased risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults older than 70 years, with risk increasing with age; however, the magnitude of these risks is, on average, small. The USPSTF found evidence of potential serious fetal harms from pharmacologic treatment of depression in pregnant women, but the likelihood of these serious harms is low. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the overall magnitude of harms is small to moderate.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes with at least moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit to screening for depression in adults, including older adults, who receive care in clinical practices that have adequate systems in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate follow-up after screening. The USPSTF also concludes with at least moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit to screening for depression in pregnant and postpartum women who receive care in clinical practices that have CBT or other evidence-based counseling available after screening.</p>",Screening for Depression in Adults,"Depression in Adults, Screening, 2016",,,,,
72,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to children and adolescents aged 18 years or younger who do not have a diagnosis of MDD. This recommendation focuses on screening for MDD and does not address screening for other depressive disorders, such as minor depression or dysthymia.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
The USPSTF recommends screening for MDD in all adolescents but notes that several risk factors might help identify patients who are at higher risk. The causes of MDD are not fully known and likely involve a combination of genetic, biological, and environmental factors. Risk factors for MDD in children and adolescents include female sex; older age; family (especially maternal) history of depression; prior episode of depression; other mental health or behavioral problems; chronic medical illness; overweight and obesity; and, in some studies, Hispanic race/ethnicity. Other psychosocial risk factors include childhood abuse or neglect, exposure to traumatic events (including natural disasters), loss of a loved one or romantic relationship, family conflict, uncertainty about sexual orientation, low socioeconomic status, and poor academic performance.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Many MDD screening instruments have been developed for use in primary care and have been used in adolescents. Two that have been most often studied are the Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents (PHQ-A) and the primary care version of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Data on the accuracy of MDD screening instruments in younger children are limited.
<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>
The USPSTF found no evidence on appropriate or recommended screening intervals, and the optimal interval is unknown. Repeated screening may be most productive in adolescents with risk factors for MDD. Opportunistic screening may be appropriate for adolescents, who may have infrequent health care visits.
<h3>Treatment or Interventions</h3>
Treatment options for MDD in children and adolescents include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, collaborative care, psychosocial support interventions, and complementary and alternative medicine approaches. Fluoxetine is approved by the FDA for treatment of MDD in children aged 8 years or older, and escitalopram is approved for treatment of MDD in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. The FDA has issued a boxed warning for antidepressants, recommending that patients of all ages who start antidepressant therapy be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#citation1"">1</a>&nbsp;Collaborative care is a multicomponent, health care system&ndash;level intervention that uses care managers to link primary care providers, patients, and mental health specialists.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</h3>
In deciding whether to screen for MDD in children aged 11 years or younger, primary care providers should consider the following issues.
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
Little is known about the prevalence of MDD in children aged 11 years or younger. The mean age of onset of MDD is about 14 to 15 years. Early onset is associated with worse outcomes. The average duration of a depressive episode in childhood varies widely, from 2 to 17 months.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening for MDD in children. The USPSTF concluded that screening itself is unlikely to be associated with significant harms, aside from opportunity costs, labeling and potential stigma associated with a positive result, and referral for further evaluation and treatment.<br /><br />The USPSTF concluded, on the basis of a previous review, that the use of SSRIs in children is associated with harms, specifically risk for suicidality. Evidence on the harms of psychotherapy alone or in combination with SSRIs in children is limited. Newer studies provide little additional evidence on treatment harms in children and adolescents but do not suggest more risks. Only 4 studies examined the harms of treatment with SSRIs in children and adolescents. These studies found no increased risk for suicidality associated with antidepressant use, but risk for rare events could not be precisely determined because the studies had limited statistical power. No trials of psychotherapy or combined interventions in children examined harms.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
The USPSTF found no evidence on the current frequency of or methods used in primary care for screening for MDD in children.
<h3>Additional Approaches to Prevention</h3>
The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends collaborative care for the management of depressive disorders, based on strong evidence of effectiveness in improving depression symptoms, adherence and response to treatment, and remission and recovery from depression.

<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
In a separate recommendation statement, the USPSTF concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for suicide risk in primary care settings, including among adolescents (I statement). Other USPSTF recommendations on mental health topics pertaining to children and adolescents, including illicit drug and alcohol use, can be found on the USPSTF Web site (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#Pod5,161,"<h3>Implementation</h3>
Many screening tools are available to identify depression in children and adolescents, and some have been used in primary care. The number of items in each tool, the administrative time required to complete them, and the appropriate ages for screening vary. A positive result on an initial screening test does not necessarily indicate the need for treatment. Screening is usually done in 2 phases: the initial screening is followed by a second phase in which skilled clinicians take into account contextual factors surrounding the patient&rsquo;s current situation, through either additional probing or a formal diagnostic interview. In instances where treatment is recommended, it can be initiated by the screening provider or through referral to another set of treatment providers. A negative result on a screening test, however, does not always preclude referral when clinical judgment or parental concerns suggest it is warranted.<br /><br />The USPSTF recommends that screening be implemented with adequate systems in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate follow-up. Depression can be managed in the primary care or specialist setting or collaboratively in both settings. Treatment options for depression include pharmacologic, behavioral, multimodal, and collaborative care models, some of which require coordination. Finally, inadequate support and follow-up may result in treatment failures or harms, as indicated by the FDA boxed warning. &ldquo;Adequate systems in place&rdquo; refers to having systems and clinical staff to ensure that patients are screened and, if they screen positive, are appropriately diagnosed and treated with evidence-based care or referred to a setting that can provide the necessary care. These essential functions can be provided through a wide range of arrangements of clinician types and settings.
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
The systematic evidence review identified several critical research gaps, including the need for studies of screening for and treatment of MDD in children younger than 11 years. Large, good-quality randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) are also needed to better understand the overarching effects of screening for MDD on intermediate and long-term health outcomes. It would be helpful to quantify the proportion of persons with screen-detected MDD who are treated or referred as well as their willingness and ability to be assessed and treated.<br /><br />The systematic review excluded studies with participants who had comorbid disorders. Children and adolescents with MDD more often have comorbid conditions than those without MDD, particularly in primary care settings. This underscores the importance of additional research in child and adolescent populations that are similar to those found in primary care settings to study the effects of comorbid conditions on screening accuracy, type of MDD treatment selected, and benefits and harms.<br /><br />For treatment of MDD, research needs include well-designed studies of psychotherapy and combined treatments, as well as studies of the benefits and harms of other treatments (such as non-SSRI medications and complementary or alternative approaches). For rare events, meta-analyses are needed that include only children and adolescents with MDD and focus on current FDA-approved medications. Studies with long-term follow-up are also needed.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-children-and-adolescents-screening1#Pod6,"<h3>Importance</h3>
<p>Depression is a leading cause of disability in the United States. Children and adolescents with MDD typically have functional impairments in their performance at school or work, as well as in their interactions with their families and peers. Depression can also negatively affect the developmental trajectories of affected youth. Major depressive disorder in children and adolescents is strongly associated with recurrent depression in adulthood; other mental disorders; and increased risk for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide completion.<br /><br />In nationally representative U.S. surveys, about 8% of adolescents reported having major depression in the past year. Little is known about the prevalence of MDD in children. Among children and adolescents aged 8 to 15 years, 2% of males and 4% of females reported having MDD in the past year.</p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening instruments for depression can accurately identify MDD in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years in primary care settings. The USPSTF found no studies of screening instruments for depression in children aged 11 years or younger in primary care (or comparable) settings and concluded that the evidence is inadequate.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Early Detection and Intervention and Treatment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found no studies that directly evaluated whether screening for MDD in adolescents in primary care (or comparable) settings leads to improved health and other outcomes. However, the USPSTF found adequate evidence that treatment of MDD detected through screening in adolescents is associated with moderate benefit (for example, improved depression severity, depression symptoms, or global functioning scores).<br /><br />The USPSTF found no studies that directly evaluated whether screening for MDD in children aged 11 years or younger in primary care (or comparable) settings leads to improved health and other outcomes and found inadequate evidence on the benefits of treatment in children with screen-detected MDD.</p>
<h3>Harms of Early Detection and Intervention and Treatme<strong>nt</strong></h3>
<p>The USPSTF found no direct evidence on the harms of screening for MDD in adolescents. Medications for the treatment of depression, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have known harms. However, the magnitude of the harms of pharmacotherapy is small if patients are closely monitored, as recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).<br /><br />The USPSTF found adequate evidence on the harms of psychotherapy and psychosocial support in adolescents and estimates that the magnitude of these harms is small to none.The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening for or treatment of MDD in children aged 11 years or younger.</p>

73,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
This recommendation applies to all asymptomatic adults without known liver disease or functional abnormalities.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
The most important risk factor for HCV infection is past or current injection drug use. Another established risk factor for HCV infection is receipt of a blood transfusion before 1992. Because of the implementation of screening programs for donated blood, blood transfusions are no longer an important source of HCV infection. In contrast, 60% of new HCV infections occur in persons who report injection drug use within the past 6 months.<br /><br />Additional risk factors include long-term hemodialysis, being born to an HCV-infected mother, incarceration, intranasal drug use, getting an unregulated tattoo, and other percutaneous exposures (such as in health care workers or from having surgery before the implementation of universal precautions). Evidence on tattoos and other percutaneous exposures as risk factors for HCV infection is limited. The relative importance of these additional risk factors may differ on the basis of geographic location and other factors.<br /><br />Large population-based studies report an independent association between high-risk sexual behaviors (multiple sex partners, unprotected sex, or sex with an HCV-infected person or injection drug user) and HCV infection. However, HCV seems to be inefficiently transmitted through sexual contact, and observed associations may have been confounded by other high-risk behaviors.<br /><br />In 1998, the highest prevalence rates of the anti-HCV antibody occurred in persons with significant direct percutaneous exposures, such as injection drug users and persons with hemophilia (60% to 90%); persons with less significant percutaneous exposures involving smaller amounts of blood, such as patients receiving hemodialysis (10% to 30%), had more moderate prevalence rates. Persons engaging in high-risk sexual behaviors (1% to 10%); recipients of blood transfusions (6%); and persons with infrequent percutaneous exposures, such as health care workers (1% to 2%), had the lowest prevalence rates.Among patients with abnormal results on liver function tests (measurement of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, or bilirubin) who were tested for reasons other than HCV screening, finding the cause of the abnormality often includes testing for HCV infection and is considered case finding rather than screening; therefore, it is outside the scope of this recommendation.<br /><br />In 2010, the overall incidence rate of acute HCV infection was 0.3 cases per 100,000 persons and varied by race or ethnicity. The incidence rate for acute hepatitis C was lowest among persons of Asian or Pacific Islander descent and highest among American Indians and Alaskan natives. Blacks had the highest mortality rates from HCV, at 6.5 to 7.8 deaths per 100,000 persons, according to data from 2004 to 2008.
<h3>Birth-Cohort Screening</h3>
Persons born between 1945 and 1965 are more likely to be diagnosed with HCV infection, possibly because they received blood transfusions before the introduction of screening in 1992 or have a history of other risk factors for exposure decades earlier. Many persons with chronic HCV infection are unaware of their condition. A risk-based approach may miss detection of a substantial proportion of HCV-infected persons in the birth cohort because of a lack of patient disclosure or knowledge about prior risk status. As a result, 1-time screening for HCV infection in the birth cohort may identify infected patients at earlier stages of disease who could benefit from treatment before developing complications from liver damage.<br /><br />The USPSTF concluded that the benefit of screening for HCV infection in persons in the birth cohort is probably similar to that in persons at higher risk for infection. Birth-cohort screening is probably less efficient than risk-based screening, meaning more persons will need to be screened to identify 1 patient with HCV infection. Nevertheless, the overall number of Americans who will probably benefit from birth-cohort screening is greater than the number who will benefit from risk-based screening.<br /><br />The USPSTF recognizes that increased screening and the resulting increased diagnoses and treatment could result in increased overall harms because not all treated persons will benefit from treatment, including those who will never develop signs or symptoms of disease (overdiagnosis). The USPSTF weighed this potential harm against the potential harm of undertreatment attributable to underdiagnosis. It is hoped that future research will reduce overtreatment by clarifying which persons are most likely to benefit from early diagnosis and treatment. However, given that persons in the birth cohort have been living with HCV infection for 20 or more years, the potential benefit of screening and early treatment will probably be at its highest now and in the near future before becoming smaller. After weighing the competing harms of overtreatment and underdiagnosis, the USPSTF recommends 1-time screening for this cohort.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Anti&ndash;HCV antibody testing followed by polymerase chain reaction testing for viremia is accurate for identifying patients with chronic HCV infection. Various noninvasive tests with good diagnostic accuracy are possible alternatives to liver biopsy for diagnosing fibrosis or cirrhosis.
<h3>Screening Intervals</h3>
Persons in the birth cohort and those who are at risk because of potential exposure before universal blood screening and are not otherwise at increased risk need only be screened once. Persons with continued risk for HCV infection (injection drug users) should be screened periodically. The USPSTF found no evidence about how often screening should occur in persons who continue to be at risk for new HCV infection.
<h3>Screening Implementation</h3>
The USPSTF believes that screening should be voluntary and undertaken only with the patient's knowledge and understanding that HCV testing is planned. Patients should be informed orally or in writing that HCV testing will be performed unless they decline (opt-out screening). The USPSTF further believes that before HCV screening, patients should receive an explanation of HCV infection, how it can (and cannot) be acquired, the meaning of positive and negative test results, and the benefits and harms of treatment. Patients should also be offered the opportunity to ask questions and to decline testing.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
The purpose of antiviral treatment regimens is to prevent long-term health complications of chronic HCV infection (such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma).<br /><br />The combination of pegylated interferon (&alpha;2a or &alpha;2b) and ribavirin is the standard treatment for HCV infection. In 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the protease inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection (the predominant genotype in the United States). Trials have found increased SVR rates in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection who received triple therapy consisting of pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and boceprevir or telaprevir compared with dual therapy consisting of pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Evidence is lacking on the comparative effects of current antiviral treatments on long-term clinical outcomes. Regimens with protease inhibitors are usually of shorter duration than dual therapy (24 or 28 weeks vs. 48 weeks). Triple therapy with protease inhibitors is associated with an increased risk for hematologic events (such as anemia; neutropenia; and thrombocytopenia, particularly with boceprevir) and rash (telaprevir) compared with dual therapy. These adverse events are self-limited and typically resolve after the discontinuation of treatment.
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Research Needs and Gaps</h3>
As treatment of HCV continues to evolve, more research is needed to understand which persons benefit the most from treatment and when treatment should begin in asymptomatic persons. Research is needed on the outcomes of treatment in screen-detected patients and on treatment decisions guided by &ldquo;noninvasive&rdquo; assessment of cirrhosis and fibrosis because these patients may differ from those enrolled in treatment trials or described in prospective cohort studies. In addition, research should focus on the long-term harms associated with antiviral regimens. Other areas of needed research include frequency of testing in high-risk populations; demonstrating individual or public health benefits from counseling, immunizations, and behavioral changes after an HCV diagnosis in asymptomatic patients; the effect of antiviral treatments on quality of life; and the comparative effectiveness of antiviral treatments in patients with various medical and psychological comorbid conditions.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/hepc/hepcfinalrs.htm#consider,129,"The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American College of Gastroenterology recommend screening in higher-risk patients.

The magnitude of the health benefits of aspirin use depends on an individual&rsquo;s baseline CVD risk and willingness to take aspirin for a sufficient duration to obtain the benefit of reduced incidence of CRC. The magnitude of harms depends on the presence of risk factors for bleeding.
<h4>Baseline CVD Risk</h4>
The magnitude of the cardiovascular risk reduction with aspirin use depends on an individual&rsquo;s initial risk for CVD events. Risk assessment for CVD should include ascertainment of the following risk factors: age, sex, race/ethnicity, total cholesterol level, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, hypertension treatment, diabetes, and smoking. An online version of the ACC/AHA risk calculator can be found at <a href=""http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator/"" target=""_blank"">http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator/</a><a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/exit-disclaimer"" title=""This link goes offsite.

<h4>CRC Prevention</h4>
Colorectal cancer prevention plays an important role in the overall health benefit of aspirin, but this benefit is not apparent until 10 years after aspirin therapy is started. Patients need to take aspirin for at least 5 to 10 years to realize this potential benefit,<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation6"">6</a>, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation7"">7</a> and persons with shorter life expectancy are less likely to benefit. Thus, aspirin use is more likely to have an effect when it is started between the ages of 50 and 59 years. Because of the time required before a reduced incidence in CRC is seen, older persons (that is, 60 years or older) are less likely to realize this benefit than adults aged 50 to 59 years.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation8"">8</a>
<h4>GI and Intracranial Bleeding</h4>
Evidence shows that risk for GI bleeding, with and without aspirin use, increases with age. For this recommendation, the USPSTF considered older age and male sex to be important risk factors for GI bleeding. Other risk factors include upper GI tract pain, GI ulcers, concurrent anticoagulation or NSAID use, and uncontrolled hypertension.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation4"">4</a>, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation5"">5</a> Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy combined with aspirin use increases the risk for serious GI bleeding compared with aspirin use alone.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation9"">9</a> The rate of serious bleeding among aspirin users is about 2 to 3 times greater in patients with a history of GI ulcer.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation10"">10</a> The risk for serious GI bleeding is 2 times greater in men than in women.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation10"">10</a> These risk factors increase the risk for bleeding substantially and should be considered in the overall decision about whether to start or continue aspirin therapy. There is no evidence that enteric-coated or buffered formulations reduce the risk for serious GI bleeding.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation2"">2</a>, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation4"">4</a>, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation11"">11</a>
<h4>Balance of Benefits and Harms</h4>
The USPSTF used a CVD microsimulation model to estimate cardiovascular event rates based on baseline risk factors and aspirin use. It used the AHA/ACC risk calculator to stratify findings of benefits and harms by 10-year CVD risk. The USPSTF also calculated estimates of CRC incidence and harms of bleeding to determine the net balance of benefits and harms across individuals with varying baseline CVD risk.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation8"">8</a>, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation12"">12<br /><br /></a><a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#tab1"">Table 1</a> and <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#tab2"">Table 2</a> present the USPSTF&rsquo;s estimated lifetime number of nonfatal MIs, ischemic strokes, and cases of CRC prevented, stratified by 10-year CVD risk level, age, and sex, among adults aged 50 to 69 years (the age range with evidence of net benefit from aspirin use). In addition, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#tab1"">Table 1</a> and <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#tab2"">Table 2</a> present the USPSTF&rsquo;s estimated lifetime number of GI bleeding events and hemorrhagic strokes. The USPSTF developed these estimates assuming that aspirin users are not taking NSAIDs and do not have other conditions that increase risk for GI bleeding. The USPSTF estimated life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) saved as one part of its consideration of the balance of benefits and harms of these disparate clinical outcomes (see the Implementation section for more information on interpreting the results in <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#tab1"">Table 1</a> and <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#tab2"">Table 2</a>).<br /><br />Overall, the USPSTF determined that the greatest net benefit to be gained is by adults aged 50 to 59 years whose 10-year CVD risk is 10% or greater. The USPSTF recommends that persons in this age and risk group start taking aspirin. Adults aged 60 to 69 years may also benefit from starting aspirin use, although the net benefit is smaller due to the increased risk for GI bleeding and decreased benefit in CRC prevention in this age group.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation8"">8<br /><br /></a>Further, the decision about the level of CVD risk at which the potential benefits outweigh potential harms is an individual one. Some adults may decide that avoiding an MI or a stroke is very important and that having a GI bleeding event is not as significant. They may decide to take aspirin at a lower CVD risk level than those who are more concerned about GI bleeding. Adults who have a high likelihood of benefit with little potential for harm should be encouraged to consider aspirin use. Conversely, adults who have little potential for benefit or are at high risk for GI bleeding should be discouraged from it.
<h3>Treatment and Dosage</h3>
The optimal dose of aspirin to prevent CVD events is not known. Primary prevention trials have demonstrated benefits with various regimens, including doses of 75 and 100 mg per day and 100 and 325 mg every other day. A dose of 75 mg per day seems as effective as higher doses. The risk for GI bleeding may increase with the dosage. A pragmatic approach consistent with the evidence is to prescribe 81 mg per day, which is the most commonly prescribed dose in the United States.<br /><br />Although the optimal timing and frequency of discussions about aspirin therapy are unknown, a reasonable approach may be to assess CVD and bleeding risk factors starting at age 50 years and periodically thereafter, as well as when CVD and bleeding risk factors are first detected or change.
<h3>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statements</h3>
<h4>Potential Preventable Burden</h4>
Evidence from primary prevention trials on the benefits of initiating aspirin use in adults younger than 50 years is limited. The potential benefit is probably lower than in adults aged 50 to 69 years because the risk for CVD events is lower (only a small percentage of adults younger than 50 years have a 10-year CVD risk &ge;10%).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation8"">8</a>Adults younger than 50 years who have an increased 10-year CVD risk may gain significant benefit from aspirin use; how much benefit is uncertain.Evidence on the benefits and harms of initiating aspirin use in older adults is limited. Many adults aged 70 years or older are at increased risk for CVD because of their age. They have a high incidence of MI and stroke; thus, the potential benefit of aspirin could be substantial.
<h4>Potential Harms</h4>
The relationship between older age and GI bleeding is well-established; thus, the potential harms for adults older than 70 years are significant. The complexity of risk factors, medication use, and concomitant illness make it difficult to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating aspirin use in this age group. In addition, aspirin use in adults older than 70 years results in smaller reductions in the incidence of CRC compared with younger adults.
<h4>Current Practice</h4>
Nearly 40% of U.S. adults older than 50 years use aspirin for the primary or secondary prevention of CVD.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation5"">5</a> A study of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data assessed how common aspirin use is for the primary prevention of CVD and whether physicians recommend it or patients start it on their own. Among patients who were eligible for aspirin therapy and were at increased CHD risk (&gt;10% 10-year risk), about 41% were told by a physician to take aspirin. Among patients aged 65 years or older who were told by a physician to take aspirin, 80% adhered to the recommendation.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation13"">13</a>

The USPSTF has made other recommendations on CVD prevention, including smoking cessation and promoting a healthful diet and physical activity, as well as screening for carotid artery stenosis, CHD, high blood pressure, lipid disorders, obesity, diabetes, and peripheral artery disease. In addition, it has made recommendations on screening for CRC. These recommendations are available on the USPSTF Web site (<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/"">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>).

Million Hearts (<a href=""http://www.millionhearts.hhs.gov/"" target=""_blank"">www.millionhearts.hhs.gov</a>) is a national initiative to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes by 2017. It aims to prevent heart disease and stroke by improving access to effective care, improving the quality of care for the &ldquo;ABCS&rdquo; (aspirin when appropriate, blood pressure control, cholesterol management, and smoking cessation), focusing clinical attention on the prevention of heart attack and stroke, and activating the public to lead a heart-healthy lifestyle.<br /><br />The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends several intervention strategies to prevent CVD for communities and health care organizations (available at <a href=""http://www.thecommunityguide.org/cvd/"" target=""_blank"">www.thecommunityguide.org/cvd/</a>). For health care systems, it recommends introducing clinical decision-support systems to implement clinical guidelines at the point of care. For insurers and payers, it recommends reducing out-of-pocket costs to patients for medications to control high blood pressure and high cholesterol. For clinicians and health care organizations, it recommends incorporating multidisciplinary team-based care to improve blood pressure control, including patients, primary care providers, and other professionals (such as nurses, pharmacists, dietitians, social workers, and community health workers).",,163,"The AHA and the American Stroke Association<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation34"">34</a> recommend the use of low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular (including but not specific to stroke) prophylaxis in adults whose risk is sufficiently high for the benefits to outweigh the risks associated with treatment; they suggest that a 10-year CVD risk of 6% to 10% is sufficient.<br /><br />The American Diabetes Association suggests low-dose aspirin therapy for primary prevention in patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes who have an increased CVD risk (&gt;10% 10-year CVD risk) and are not at increased risk for bleeding. It does not recommend aspirin therapy in men younger than 50 years or most women younger than 60 years who have low CVD risk because the risk for bleeding outweighs the potential benefits of aspirin treatment.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation35"">35<br /><br /></a>Previous recommendations from the American Academy of Family Physicians about aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD and CRC have been consistent with those of the USPSTF.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation36"">36</a> The American College of Chest Physicians suggests that patients older than 50 years without symptomatic CVD use low-dose aspirin for primary CVD prevention.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation37"">37<br /><br /></a>No organizations recommend aspirin use for the primary prevention of CRC in average-risk adults. The American Cancer Society recognizes that long-term regular aspirin use has both harms and benefits, including reduced risk for CRC, but has not formally reviewed the evidence and does not currently have recommendations for or against aspirin use.

<p>Cardiovascular disease and CRC are major causes of death among U.S. adults. In 2011, more than one half of all deaths in the United States were caused by heart disease, cancer, or stroke.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation1"">1</a>, <a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation2"">2</a></p>
<h3>Recognition of Risk Status</h3>
<p>The primary risk factors for CVD include older age, male sex, race/ethnicity, abnormal lipid levels, high blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking.<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation2"">2</a><br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation2""></a>The USPSTF used a calculator derived from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) pooled cohort equations to predict 10-year risk for first hard atherosclerotic CVD event (defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI], coronary heart disease [CHD] death, and fatal or nonfatal stroke).<a href=""http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#citation3"">3</a> Although concerns have been raised about the equations&rsquo; potential to overpredict risk and their moderate discrimination, they are the only U.S.-based, externally validated equations that report risk as a combination of cerebrovascular and CHD events.<br /><br /><br />Risk factors for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding with aspirin use include higher dose and longer duration of use, history of GI ulcers or upper GI pain, bleeding disorders, renal failure, severe liver disease, and thrombocytopenia.

<h3>Benefits of Aspirin Use</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that aspirin use to reduce risk for cardiovascular events (nonfatal MI and stroke) in adults aged 50 to 69 years who are at increased CVD risk is of moderate benefit. The magnitude of benefit varies by age and 10-year CVD risk.The USPSTF found adequate evidence that aspirin use reduces the incidence of CRC in adults after 5 to 10 years of use.The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that aspirin use reduces risk for CVD events in adults who are at increased CVD risk and are younger than 50 years or older than 69 years.</p>
<h3>Harms of Aspirin Use</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that aspirin use in adults increases the risk for GI bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke. <br /><br /><br />The USPSTF determined that the harms vary but are small in adults aged 59 years or younger and small to moderate in adults aged 60 to 69 years. <br /><br /><br />The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine the harms of aspirin use in adults aged 70 years or older.</p>
<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>In adults aged 50 to 69 years who are at increased CVD risk, the benefits of aspirin use include prevention of MI and ischemic stroke and, with long-term use, reduced incidence of CRC. Aspirin use may also result in small to moderate harms, including GI bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke.<br /><br />The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the benefit of aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events, combined with the reduced incidence of CRC, outweighs the increased risk for bleeding by a moderate amount in adults aged 50 to 59 years who have a 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater.<br /><br />The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the benefit of aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events, combined with the reduced incidence of CRC, outweighs the increased risk for bleeding by a small amount in adults aged 60 to 69 years who have a 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater.<br /><br />The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on aspirin use in adults younger than 50 years or older than 69 years is insufficient and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.</p>",Preventive Medication for Aspirin Use to Prevent Cardiovascular Disease and Colorectal Cancer,"Aspirin Use to Prevent Cardiovascular Disease and Colorectal Cancer, Preventive Medication, 2016",,,,,

76,"<p><b>Patient Population Under Consideration</b></p>
<p>This recommendation applies to adults 18 years or older. The USPSTF uses the following terms to define categories of increased BMI: &ldquo;overweight&rdquo; is a BMI of 25 to 29.9 and &ldquo;obesity&rdquo; is a BMI of 30 or higher. Obesity can be categorized as class 1 (BMI of 30.0 to 34.9), class 2 (BMI of 35.0 to 39.9), or class 3 (BMI of &ge;40) (see the Table for other USPSTF recommendations related to weight).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Behavioral Counseling Interventions</b></p>
<p>Many of the effective intensive behavioral interventions considered by the USPSTF were designed to help participants achieve or maintain a 5% or greater weight loss through a combination of dietary changes and increased physical activity. The US Food and Drug Administration considers a weight loss of 5% as clinically important.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the intensive behavioral weight loss interventions considered by the USPSTF lasted for 1 to 2 years, and the majority had 12 or more sessions in the first year.1 One-third of the interventions had a &ldquo;core&rdquo; phase (ranging from 3-12 months) followed by a &ldquo;support&rdquo; or &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; phase (ranging from 9-12 months).1 Most behavioral interventions encouraged self-monitoring of weight and provided tools to support weight loss or weight loss maintenance (eg, pedometers, food scales, or exercise videos).1 Similar behavior change techniques and weight loss messages were used across the trials.1 Some trials provided interventions modeled after the Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle intervention for use in a primary care or community setting.1 Study heterogeneity, trial quality, and differences in populations and settings made it difficult to identify the most effective intervention characteristics (eg, number of sessions, in-person vs remote sessions, or group- vs individual-based).1 Benefits may depend on tailoring interventions to social, environmental, and individual factors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interventionists varied across the trials, and interventions included varied interactions with a primary care clinician. Primary care clinician involvement ranged from limited interactions with participants in interventions conducted by other practitioners or individuals (ie, group-based interventions conducted by lifestyle coaches or registered dietitians) to reinforcing intervention messages through brief counseling sessions.1 Few interventions included a primary care clinician as the primary interventionist over 3 to 12 months of individual counseling. In the trials not involving a primary care clinician, the interventionists were highly diverse and included behavioral therapists, psychologists, registered dietitians, exercise physiologists, lifestyle coaches, and other staff. The majority of the trials focused on individual participants, but a few interventions invited family members to participate.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trials used various delivery methods (group, individual, mixed, and technology- or print-based). Group-based interventions ranged from 8 group sessions over 2.5 months to weekly group sessions over 1 year (median, 23 total sessions in the first year). These interventions consisted of classroom-style sessions lasting 1 to 2 hours.1 Within the group-based interventions, some trials offered supplemental support with 1 brief individual counseling session, while other trials provided referral and free access to commercially available group-based weight loss programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the individual-based interventions provided individual counseling sessions, with or without ongoing telephone support.1 The remaining interventions were provided remotely through telephone counseling calls (average time, 15-30 minutes) and web-based self-monitoring and support. The median number of sessions in the first year for individual-based interventions was 12.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mixed interventions included comparatively equal numbers of group- and individual-based counseling sessions, with or without other forms of support (eg, telephone-, print-, or web-based). Most of these interventions took place for more than 1 year and involved more than 12 sessions (median, 23 total sessions in the first year).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among technology-based interventions, intervention components included computer- or web-based intervention modules,1 web-based self-monitoring, mobile phone&ndash;based text messages, smartphone applications, social networking platforms, or DVD learning. Only 1 trial delivered its intervention through print-based tailored materials.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rates of participant adherence were generally high.1 More than two-thirds of study participants completed interventions. In addition, all study participants completed more than two-thirds of the intervention. Participation rates did decline over time.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Behavior-based weight loss maintenance trials were designed to maintain weight loss by continuing dietary changes and physical activity.1 Interventions included group interventions, technology-based individual counseling sessions, or a combination of individual and group counseling. Most weight loss maintenance interventions lasted for 12 to 18 months; the majority of interventions had more than 12 sessions in the first year.1 Intervention components focused on nutrition, physical activity, self-monitoring, identifying barriers, problem solving, peer support, and relapse prevention.1 Participants used tools such as food diaries and pedometers to help maintain weight loss.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interventions that combined pharmacotherapy with behavioral interventions reported greater weight loss and weight loss maintenance over 12 to 18 months compared with behavioral interventions alone.1 However, the participants in the pharmacotherapy trials were required to meet highly selective inclusion criteria, including adherence to taking medications and meeting weight loss goals before enrollment. These trials also had high attrition.1 Therefore, it is unclear how well patients tolerate these medications and whether the findings from these trials are applicable to the general US primary care population. In addition, data were lacking about the maintenance of improvement after discontinuation of pharmacotherapy.1 As a result, the USPSTF encourages clinicians to promote behavioral interventions as the primary focus of effective interventions for weight loss in adults.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Additional Approaches to Prevention</b></p>
<p>The USPSTF has made recommendations on screening for abnormal blood glucose levels and type 2 diabetes,13 screening for high blood pressure,14 statin use in persons at risk for cardiovascular disease,15 counseling for tobacco smoking cessation,16 aspirin use in certain persons for prevention of cardiovascular disease,17 and behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity for cardiovascular disease prevention in adults with and without common risk factors18, 19 (Table). The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen for obesity in children 6 years or older and offer or refer them to a comprehensive, intensive behavioral intervention (B recommendation).20</p>

<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends multicomponent interventions that use technology-supported coaching or counseling to help adults lose weight and maintain weight loss.21</p>",,201,"<p><b>Other Considerations</b></p>
<p>Research Needs and Gaps</p>
<p>Further research is needed to examine the effects of interventions for obesity on longer-term weight and health outcomes (eg, cardiovascular outcomes), including data on important subpopulations (eg, older adults, racial/ethnic groups, or persons who are overweight). Psychosocial, quality of life, and patient-centered outcomes should continue to be evaluated in future studies. Well-designed pragmatic trials and improved reporting of intervention characteristics to enable evaluation and dissemination of interventions in primary care settings are needed. Future research is needed on factors (eg, genetics or untreated medical or psychological conditions) that may be barriers to weight loss during behavioral interventions. Trials are needed that examine whether interventions that focus on both weight loss and support of persons living with obesity improve patient-centered outcomes. Comparative effectiveness trials would provide more evidence about the components of effective interventions.</p>

<p><b>Recommendations of Others</b></p>
<p>The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommends screening for obesity in adults with BMI at primary care visits.34 The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and the Obesity Society recommend screening for obesity in adults with BMI and waist circumference.35, 36 The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American College of Endocrinology, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend screening for obesity with BMI and using waist circumference as a supplement in adults with a BMI higher than 35.37, 38 The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends screening for obesity in all adults and offering or referring patients with a BMI of 30 or higher to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions.39</p>",,"<p><b>Importance</b></p>
<p>More than 35% of men and 40% of women in the United States are obese.1, 2 Obesity is associated with health problems such as increased risk for coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, various types of cancer, gallstones, and disability.1, 3-7 Obesity is also associated with an increased risk for death, particularly among adults younger than 65 years.1 The leading causes of death among adults with obesity include ischemic heart disease, type 2 diabetes, respiratory diseases, and cancer (eg, liver, kidney, breast, endometrial, prostate, and colon cancer).1, 3, 8-12</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Benefits of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</b></p>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavior-based weight loss interventions in adults with obesity can lead to clinically significant improvements in weight status and reduced incidence of type 2 diabetes among adults with obesity and elevated plasma glucose levels. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavior-based weight loss maintenance interventions are associated with less weight gain after the cessation of interventions, compared with control groups. The magnitude of these benefits is moderate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Harms of Behavioral Counseling Interventions</b></p>
<p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the harms of intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions (ie, behavior-based weight loss and weight loss maintenance interventions) in adults with obesity as small to none, based on the absence of reported harms in the evidence and the noninvasive nature of the interventions. When direct evidence is limited, absent, or restricted to select populations or clinical scenarios, the USPSTF may place conceptual upper or lower bounds on the magnitude of benefit or harms.</p>

<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">In deciding which postmenopausal women younger than 65 years to screen with bone measurement testing, clinicians should first consider factors associated with increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. These include parental history of hip fracture, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and low body weight. In addition, menopausal status in women is also an important consideration because studies demonstrating treatment benefit mainly enrolled postmenopausal women. For postmenopausal women younger than 65 years who have at least 1 risk factor, a reasonable approach to determine who should be screened with bone measurement testing is to use a clinical risk assessment tool.</p>
<p style=""padding: 6px 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"">Several tools are available to assess osteoporosis risk: the Simple Calculated Osteoporosis Risk Estimation (SCORE; Merck), Osteoporosis Risk Assessment Instrument (ORAI), Osteoporosis Index of Risk (OSIRIS), and the Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool (OST). These tools seem to perform similarly and are moderately accurate at predicting osteoporosis. The FRAX tool (University of Sheffield), which assesses a person&rsquo;s 10-year risk of fracture, is also a commonly used tool. The FRAX tool includes questions about previous DXA results but does not require this information to estimate fracture risk. Because the benefits of treatment are greater in persons at higher risk of fracture, one approach is to perform bone measurement testing in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years who have a 10-year FRAX risk of major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) (without DXA) greater than that of a 65-year-old white woman without major risk factors.

The choice of therapy should be an individual one based on the patient's clinical situation and the trade-off between benefits and harms. Clinicians should educate patients on how to minimize the adverse effects of drug therapies, such as reducing esophageal irritation from bisphosphonate therapy by taking the medication with a full glass of water and not lying down for at least 30 minutes afterward.</p>

<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
<p>The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of testicular examination in asymptomatic patients are unknown. Screening examinations performed by patients or clinicians are unlikely to provide meaningful health benefits because of the low incidence and high survival rate of testicular cancer, even when it is detected at symptomatic stages.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Management of testicular cancer consists of orchiectomy and may include other surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, depending on the disease stage and tumor type. Regardless of disease stage, more than 90% of all newly diagnosed cases of testicular cancer will be cured.</p>

<p>Testicular cancer (a primary germ-cell tumor of the testis) is the most common cancer among males aged 15 to 34 years. However, with an annual incidence rate of 5.4 cases per 100,000 males, testicular cancer is relatively rare compared with other types of cancer.</p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>Most cases of testicular cancer are discovered accidentally by patients or their partners. There is inadequate evidence that screening by clinician examination or patient self-examination has a higher yield or greater accuracy for detecting testicular cancer at earlier (and more curable) stages.</p>

80,"<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>
The risk for lung cancer increases with age and cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke and decreases with time since quitting smoking. The best evidence for the benefit of screening comes from the NLST, which enrolled adults aged 55 to 74 years who had at least a 30 pack-year smoking history and were current smokers or had quit within the past 15 years. As with all screening trials, the NLST tested a specific intervention over a finite period. Because initial eligibility extended through age 74 years and participants received 3 annual screening computed tomographic scans, the oldest participants in the trial were aged 77 years. <br /><br />The USPSTF used modeling studies to predict the benefits and harms of screening programs that use different screening intervals, age ranges, smoking histories, and times since quitting. A program that annually screens adults aged 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years is projected to have a reasonable balance of benefits and harms. The model assumes that persons who achieve 15 years of smoking cessation during the screening program discontinue screening. This model predicts the outcomes of continuing the screening program used in the NLST through age 80 years. <br /><br />Screening may not be appropriate for patients with substantial comorbid conditions, particularly those who are in the upper end of the screening age range. The NLST excluded persons who were unlikely to complete curative lung cancer surgery and those with medical conditions that posed a substantial risk for death during the 8-year trial. The baseline characteristics of the NLST showed a relatively healthy sample, and fewer than 10% of enrolled participants were older than 70 years. Persons with serious comorbid conditions may experience net harm, no net benefit, or at least substantially less net benefit. Similarly, persons who are unwilling to have curative lung surgery are unlikely to benefit from a screening program.
<h3>Assessment of Risk</h3>
Age, total exposure to tobacco smoke, and years since quitting smoking are important risk factors for lung cancer and were used to determine eligibility in the NLST. Other risk factors include specific occupational exposures, radon exposure, family history, and history of pulmonary fibrosis or chronic obstructive lung disease. The incidence of lung cancer is relatively low in persons younger than 50 years but increases with age, especially after age 60 years. In current and former smokers, age-specific incidence rates increase with age and cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke.<br /><br />Smoking cessation substantially reduces a person's risk for developing and dying of lung cancer. Among persons enrolled in the NLST, those who were at highest risk because of additional risk factors or a greater cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke experienced most of the benefit. A validated multivariate model showed that persons in the highest 60% of risk accounted for 88% of all deaths preventable by screening.
<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
Low-dose computed tomography has shown high sensitivity and acceptable specificity for the detection of lung cancer in high-risk persons. Chest radiography and sputum cytologic evaluation have not shown adequate sensitivity or specificity as screening tests. Therefore, LDCT is currently the only recommended screening test for lung cancer.
<h3>Treatment</h3>
Surgical resection is the current standard of care for localized NSCLC. This type of cancer is treated with surgical resection when possible and also with radiation and chemotherapy. Annual LDCT screening may not be useful for patients with life-limiting comorbid conditions or poor functional status who may not be candidates for surgery.
<h3>Other Approaches to Prevention</h3>
Smoking cessation is the most important intervention to prevent NSCLC. Advising smokers to stop smoking and preventing nonsmokers from being exposed to tobacco smoke are the most effective ways to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with lung cancer. Current smokers should be informed of their continuing risk for lung cancer and offered cessation treatments. Screening with LDCT should be viewed as an adjunct to tobacco cessation interventions.
<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
Clinicians have many resources to help patients stop smoking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has developed a Web site with many such resources, including information on tobacco quit lines, available in several languages (<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips"">www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips</a>). Quit lines provide telephone-based behavioral counseling and support to tobacco users who want to quit smoking. Counseling is provided by trained cessation specialists who follow standardized protocols that may include several sessions and are generally provided at no cost to users. The content has been adapted for specific populations and can be tailored for individual clients. Strong evidence shows that quit lines can expand the use of evidence-based tobacco cessation treatments in populations that may have limited access to treatment options. <br /><br />Combination therapy with counseling and medications is more effective at increasing cessation rates than either component alone. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved several forms of nicotine replacement therapy (gum, lozenge, transdermal patch, inhaler, and nasal spray), as well as bupropion and varenicline. More information on the treatment of tobacco dependence can be found in the U.S. Public Health Service Reference Guide &ldquo;Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence: 2008 Update&rdquo; (available at <a href=""http://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/clinicians-providers/guidelines-recommendations/tobacco/clinicians/reference/tobaqrg.pdf"">www.ahrq.gov/professionals/clinicians-providers/guidelines-recommendations/tobacco/clinicians/reference/tobaqrg.pdf</a>). The National Cancer Institute has developed a patient and physician guide for shared decision making for lung cancer screening based on the NLST (available at <a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/qa/2002/NLSTstudyGuidePatientsPhysicians"">www.cancer.gov/newscenter/qa/2002/NLSTstudyGuidePatientsPhysicians</a>). This 1-page resource may be a useful communication tool for providers and patients. <br /><br />In addition, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network has developed guidelines for the follow-up of lung nodules. The appropriate follow-up and management of abnormalities found on LDCT scans are important given the high rates of false-positive results and the potential for harms. Lung cancer screening with LDCT should be implemented as part of a program of care, as outlined in the next section.",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/lungcan/lungcanfinalrs.htm#consider,137,"In 2012, the American College of Chest Physicians, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the American Thoracic Society recommended screening for lung cancer with LDCT primarily on the basis of results from the NLST, using eligibility criteria that closely modeled those of the NLST (persons aged 55 to 74 years who have a &ge;30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit in the past 15 years). The recommendations also stipulated that screening should be offered only in clinical settings similar to those in the trial. <br /><br />The American Association for Thoracic Surgery&nbsp;recommends annual screening with LDCT in current and former smokers aged 55 to 79 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history. It also recommends annual screening starting at age 50 to 79 years in patients who have a 20 pack-year smoking history and additional comorbid conditions that produce a cumulative risk for cancer of at least 5% over the next 5 years. Furthermore, it recommends annual screening in long-term cancer survivors aged 55 to 79 years. <br /><br />In 2013, the American Cancer Society&nbsp;also began recommending screening for lung cancer with LDCT in high-risk patients who are in relatively good health and meet the NLST criteria (persons aged 55 to 74 years who have a &ge;30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit in the past 15 years). It recommends against the use of chest radiography and strongly suggests that all adults who receive screening enter an organized screening program that has experience in LDCT. <br /><br />In addition, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network&nbsp;recommends LDCT screening in selected patients who are at high risk for lung cancer. High risk is defined as persons aged 55 to 74 years who have at least a 30 pack-year smoking history and, if a former smoker, 15 years or less since quitting or persons aged 50 years or older who have at least a 20 pack-year smoking history and 1 additional risk factor. It does not recommend lung cancer screening in persons who are at moderate risk (aged &ge;50 years and &ge;20 pack-year smoking history or secondhand smoke exposure but no additional lung cancer risk factors) or low risk (younger than 50 years or smoking history of &lt;20 pack-years).",http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf13/lungcan/lungcanfinalrs.htm#recommendations,,Screening for Lung Cancer,"Lung Cancer, Screening, 2013",,,,,

<h3>Patient Population Under Consideration</h3>

<p>This recommendation applies to all pregnant women.</p>

<h3>Screening Tests</h3>
<p>Screening for HBV infection by testing for HBsAg should be performed in each pregnancy, regardless of previous hepatitis B vaccination or previous negative HBsAg test results.</p>

<h3>Timing of Screening</h3>
<p>A test for HBsAg should be ordered at the first prenatal visit with other recommended screening tests. At the time of admission to a hospital, birth center, or other delivery setting, women with unknown HBsAg status or with new or continuing risk factors for HBV infection (such as injection drug use or evaluation or treatment for a sexually transmitted disease) should receive screening.</p>

<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Infants born to HBV-infected mothers should receive hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin within 12 hours of birth. Infants born to mothers with unknown HBsAg status should receive hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth, followed by hepatitis B immune globulin as soon as possible (but not later than 7 days after birth) if the mother tests positive for HBsAg.</p>
<p>Pregnant women who test positive for HBsAg should be referred to an appropriate case-management program and should be provided with or referred for counseling and medical management of HBV infection. Counseling should include information about prevention of HBV transmission to sexual partners and household contacts and reassurance regarding the safety of breastfeeding in infants who receive appropriate prophylaxis.</p>

<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Screening for HBV infection in pregnant women is necessary but not sufficient to prevent disease transmission to newborns. To realize the maximum benefit from screening, primary care clinicians and delivery settings must establish effective systems for the accurate and timely transfer of maternal HBsAg test results to the labor, delivery, and newborn medical records.</p>

<h3>Research Needs/Gaps</h3>
<p>Research is needed to assess the effect of long-standing universal childhood hepatitis B vaccination on the magnitude of benefit of screening for HBV infection in U.S.-born pregnant women. Research is also needed to determine the net health benefit to the mother and infant of treating pregnant women whose chronic HBV infections are identified by prenatal screening.</p>",http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf09/hepb/hepbpgrs.htm#clinical,103,"<h2>Recommendations of Others</h2>

Chronic HBV infections increase long-term morbidity and mortality by predisposing infected persons to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.</p>

<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>The principal screening test for detecting maternal HBV infection is the serologic identification of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Immunoassays for detecting HBsAg have a reported sensitivity and specificity greater than 98%.</p>

<h3>Benefits of Detection and Early Intervention</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that universal prenatal screening for HBV infection substantially reduces perinatal transmission of HBV and the subsequent development of chronic HBV infection. The current practice of vaccinating all infants against HBV infection and providing postexposure prophylaxis with hepatitis B immune globulin administered at birth to infants of mothers infected with HBV substantially reduces the risk for acquiring HBV infection.</p>

<h3>Harms of Detection and Early Intervention</h3>
<p>The USPSTF found no published studies that describe harms of screening for HBV infection in pregnant women. The USPSTF concluded that the potential harms of screening are no greater than small.</p>

<h3>USPSTF Assessment</h3>
<p>The USPSTF concludes that there is high certainty that the net benefit of screening pregnant women for HBV infection is substantial.</p>",Hepatitis B in Pregnancy,"Hepatitis B in Pregnancy, 2009",,,,,
82,,,65,"The CDC recommends universal screening in communities where  12% of children aged 1 to 3 years have elevated blood levels, or, in communities that do not have prevalence data, if  27% of the housing was built before 1950. The CDC recommends targeted screening for all other children based on an individual risk assessment, including whether children receive Medicaid, Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), or other forms of governmental assistance. This approach is also supported by the American College of Preventive Medicine. <br><br>

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pediatricians learn whether city or state health departments provide guidance for screening children who are not eligible for Medicaid. If no such guidance is available, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pediatricians consider screening all children. Children should, ideally, be tested at 1 and 2 years of age.<br><br>

The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends screening 12-month-old infants for lead poisoning if they live in communities in which the prevalence of lead levels requiring intervention is high or undefined; if they live in or frequently visit a home built before 1950 that has dilapidated paint or recent or ongoing renovations or remodeling; if they have close contact with a person who has an elevated BLL or who lives near lead industry or heavy traffic; or if they live with someone whose job or hobby involves lead exposure, uses lead-based pottery, or takes traditional remedies that contain lead.<br><br>

Medicaid's Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment Program (EPSDT) requires that all children receive a screening blood lead test at 12 and 24 months of age; children between the ages of 36 and 72 months of age must receive a screening blood lead test if they have not previously been screened for lead poisoning.<br><br>

No national organizations currently recommend screening pregnant women for elevated BLLs.",,"<br><B>Importance<br></B>

BLLs in children have declined dramatically in the United States over the past 2 decades. However, segments of the population remain at increased risk for higher BLLs. Even relatively low BLLs are associated with neurotoxic effects in children. Severely elevated BLLs in symptomatic pregnant women are associated with poor health outcomes; however, BLLs in this range are rare in the US population. <br><br>

<B>Detection<br></B>
There is good evidence that venous sampling accurately detects elevated BLLs and fair evidence that validated questionnaires are modestly useful in identifying children at increased risk for elevated BLLs. <br><br>

<B>Benefits of Detection and Early Intervention<br></B>

The USPSTF found good-quality evidence that interventions do not result in sustained decreases in BLLs and found insufficient evidence (no studies) evaluating residential lead hazard-control efforts (ie, dust or paint removal, soil abatement, counseling, or education) or nutritional interventions for improving neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with mildly-to-moderately elevated BLLs. The USPSTF found no studies examining the effectiveness of screening or interventions in improving health outcomes in asymptomatic pregnant women. Given the low prevalence of elevated BLLs in children at average risk and asymptomatic pregnant women, the magnitude of potential benefit cannot be greater than small.<br><br>
A theoretical benefit of screening is that identification may prevent lead poisoning of other individuals in a shared environment, but the magnitude of this theoretical benefit is uncertain. <br><br>
<B>
Harms of Detection and Early Treatment<br></B>

There is good-quality evidence that chelation treatment in asymptomatic children does not improve neurodevelopmental outcomes and is associated with a slight diminution in cognitive performance. Chelation therapy may result in transient renal, hepatic, and other toxicity, mild gastrointestinal symptoms, sensitivity reactions, and rare life-threatening reactions. Residential lead-based paint and dust hazard-control treatments may lead to acutely increased BLLs from improper removal techniques. Potential harms of screening are false-positive results, anxiety, inconvenience, work or school absenteeism, and financial costs associated with repeated testing. Although the exact magnitude of these known and potential harms is uncertain, the overall magnitude is at least small. <br><br>
No studies have directly addressed the harms of screening and interventions for pregnant women. Although there is little specific evidence concerning the potential harms of interventions for pregnant women with elevated BLLs, the magnitude of harms from such interventions is also at least small. <br><br>

<B>USPSTF Assessment<br></B>

The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance between potential benefits and harms of routine screening for elevated BLLs in children at increased risk. Given the significant potential harms of treatment and residential lead hazard abatement, and no evidence of treatment benefit, the USPSTF concluded that the harms of screening for elevated BLLs in children at average risk and in asymptomatic pregnant women outweigh the benefits.",Lead,"Lead in Children & Pregnant Women, Screening, 2006",,,,,
